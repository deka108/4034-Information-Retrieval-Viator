"We found a very special mama shop located in a Hougang void deck.

The shop has no employees manning the store and features a homemade Self-Checkout station similar to the ones you'll see in modern supermarkets.

Besides selling the usual basic necessities you'd find in normal mama shops around your house, the store also features old school snacks and goodies like the famous toy candies and wang wang cookies we all loved as a kid.

Despite its fully customer trust based system, there has not been many theft cases with only an estimated 2% being dishonest with their patronage.

"We tried something very different in this week's vlog. We looked at a problem most Singaporeans don't even know exists - littering. 

We leave our empty drinks in our movie cinemas seats. Random tissue papers are always floating on MRT seats. We choke drains with our cigarrates. And we don't even think twice about it. Because garbage on the street is better than in our pockets. 

Some of us have become so entitled that we say we ""help"" the cleaners by giving them a ""job"" to do. That's when you know something is wrong. Maybe that's why we don't return our food trays.

I'm guilty for being part of those groups at parties who don't clean up well, leaving cleaners with a ton of extra work to do. It seems normal when no one seems to care. But I'm not going to act that way again. 

Let us know if you want to do something about littering by leaving a comment or by sharing this video so more people see it.

"PSA: Forget the overcrowded Chatuchak full of tourists. Rod Fai has a new sister market Rod Fai II near the Thailand Cultural Center MRT - a huge relief to everyone because it is literally in the heart of the city. You no longer have to go through a painful 30-45 mins taxi ride to get there like before. And LOCALS come here. 

Visiting Rod Fai is very different experience from those just used to going to Chatuchak. It has FASHION, FOOD and BARS all lined up next to each other. But even this market is different from the old Rod Fai Market. 

We highly recommend Singaporeans to go here to avoid the other tourists and lepak with locals. Check out all the street food we ate!

We have been informed by MOE that the school actually requires approval from MOE before visiting and we understood the ""enter at your own risk"" sign wrongly. It is that way as it is meant to be open for residents nearby to jog along the driveways and also to provide a shortcut for nearby residents to reach the bus-stop along Braddel Road. Any un-approved visit from MOE by any public would be seen as trespassing and will be prosecuted by Police.

It is also now being guarded by security guards 24 hours daily.

The former Braddell-Westlake Secondary School has been abandoned since 2005, and as with abandoned places, eerie vibes here are at an all-time high.  The amazing thing about this place? Unlike most abandoned places, the gates here are opened with the disclaimer ""Enter at your own risk"" instead of ""Trespassers will be prosecuted."" Yay!

Graffitied walls, shattered windows and dusty floors are a dead giveaway on this place’s inhabitants. Or lack thereof. One more desolated location to check off your photography bucket list!

Mr. Trump,

I try my hardest not to be political.  I’ve refused to interview several of your fellow candidates.  I didn’t want to risk any personal goodwill by appearing to take sides in a contentious election.  I thought: ‘Maybe the timing is not right.’  But I realize now that there is no correct time to oppose violence and prejudice.  The time is always now.  Because along with millions of Americans, I’ve come to realize that opposing you is no longer a political decision.  It is a moral one. 

I’ve watched you retweet racist images.  I’ve watched you retweet racist lies.  I’ve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy.  I’ve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to ‘pay the legal fees’ of those who commit violence on your behalf.  I’ve watched you advocate the use of torture and the murder of terrorists’ families.   I’ve watched you gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.   I’ve watched you compare refugees to ‘snakes,’ and claim that ‘Islam hates us.’  

I am a journalist, Mr. Trump.  And over the last two years I have conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of Muslims, chosen at random, on the streets of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.  I’ve also interviewed hundreds of Syrian and Iraqi refugees across seven different countries.  And I can confirm— the hateful one is you.  

Those of us who have been paying attention will not allow you to rebrand yourself.  You are not a ‘unifier.’  You are not ‘presidential.’  You are not a ‘victim’ of the very anger that you’ve joyfully enflamed for months.  You are a man who has encouraged prejudice and violence in the pursuit of personal power.  And though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are.  

Sincerely,
Brandon Stanton",225524117535380_1010468419040942,TheSmartLocal,"We usually refrain from posting political stuff, but this is a message that should be shared a million times over. An Open Letter to Donald Trump:

"This is the true spirit of CNY. 

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

#bestyeyeintheworld","I am still recovering from a massive sobbing fit as I type this, so do pardon me if there are any typos or grammatical errors. This year, my family's CNY reunion dinner went completely beyond my expectaitions.

Last August I came out to Mum and Dad, and was promptly kicked out. I had prepared for the worst, though, and moved in with a friend. So all went well, more or less, except for me being somewhat depressed and withdrawn. I was not expecting to be called back for the reunion this year.

Enter my maternal grandfather, Ye Ye, a.k.a. The Colonel. He retired from the Malaysian army as a colonel, and is still much respected in the family. The fact that he takes no crap from anyone probably helped that. I was about to go for a drink (alone) for my CNY eve, when he called me. What follows is a rough outline of what he said:

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

Ye Ye himself was at the dinner table, and stood up when he saw me. What he said right then still rings in my ears.

""This is XXXX. My grandson. Some of you think he is not fit to be part of this family home simply because he is attracted to men instead of women. Shame on you! If he leaves, I will too, and FUCK anyone who dares to tell me otherwise!""

The whole house went quiet, and Ye Ye told me to come over and have some food. I was in tears by then, and he told me not to cry, and that he was sorry for not doing anything earlier (according to him no one told him anything until the afternoon, whe=n he noticed me missing from my usual spot chopping vegetables). Dinner was a silent affair, but he did ask me a lot of questions about how I'd been, whether I was happy, so on.

After dinner, I went to see him in his room, and cried. I knelt down and asked for forgiveness for not continuing his family line and for having brought any shame to him. But this man, my grandfather, a military veteran, just told me that it was fine, and that I had done no wrong. That I had been enough of a man to speak the truth, and that by doing so, he was more proud of me than if I had chosen to live a double life. He did admit to some disappointment that he wouldn't get any great grandchildren from me, but in his words, 'some things in life are not meant to be'.

""Good"" is a relative position on a spectrum. For there to be ""Good"" schools, there have to be ""Bad"" schools too. That being said, academic results alone do not determine a ""good"" school.

""I saw your recent post regarding future Singapore MRT/LRT maps and thought I’d throw mine into the ring. The Singapore MRT has long been one of my fave metro systems around the world. 

I like the concept of destination numbers and station numbers - I believe it is one of the first, if not the first, to use this concept (do let me know if that’s not quite right).  

My approach for this map is to incorporate the station number into the station marker itself to avoid some of the clutter associated placing the station name AND the number alongside the station marker.  

Also, I really wanted the Circle Line to be a circle, so I have adopted a few distortions to make that happen. Finally, I tried to incorporate geography of Singapore in a stylistic manner to further reinforce the circle motif.
