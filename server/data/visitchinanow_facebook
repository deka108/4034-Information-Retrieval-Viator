According to archaeologists, the 12.5-foot statue was carved during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). 

Hongmen reservoir, built in 1958, is located on the ruins of the ancient Xiaoshi Township, which was an important trade center and hub for water transportation between Jiangxi and Fujian provinces. 

The statue was somewhat preserved in the water, which prevented weathering. Archaeologists will continue research for the protection of the reservoir's underwater relics.
