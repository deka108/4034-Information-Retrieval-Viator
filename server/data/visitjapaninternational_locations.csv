Additionally, the Asahikawa Heiwa-dori Shopping Street in Asahikawa City, Hokkaido, introduced the new tax-free system on June 1, 2015. 
Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5,001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10,001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district.

For example, buy some Japanese teas, a kimono and anything else you fancy on the shopping street, and when you have finished shopping, just go to the tax refund counter in Seibu Department Store. Enjoy shopping at bargain prices, and take a little taste of Japan back home with you.

592,"It is often said that Japanese women’s skin is well beautiful.
Let’s find out why they are said like this.
Maybe one of reasons is using natural material cosmetics in a daily life.

Tsubaki oil (camellia-seed oil) used since 7th century, is effective in moisturizing and cutting off ultraviolet rays. Not only women use, sumo wrestlers use it to tie up their hair, and kabuki actors use it as their make-up base. 
Azuki bean has been used as skincare among upper class ladies from the ancient time. It accelerates blood flow, therefore it is good for getting rid of pimples and smoothing your skin. 
Komenuka (rice bran) is highly praised for its effect on beautifying skin. Its vitamins remove spots and works for anti-aging. 

For your information, cosmetics will be one of the tax-free products since this October.

The event is starting from 1:00p.m., but here is a secret tip that you can enjoy Yabusame!
Try getting up early to visit morning practice in the shrine. You can take your time among so few spectators and closely watch archers harmonizing themselves with horses, their skill with their spirit in the crisp morning air. They will take you back a millennium to the age of the Samurai.

Did Sukiyaki or Shabu-Shabu come up to your mind as nabe?
There are actually a whole bunch of different types of it in each area of Japan. New types of nabe keep coming up lately, such as Tonyu (Soymilk)-nabe, Tomato-nabe, Carbonara-nabe, and even Collagen-nabe (can you even imagine what it would taste like?)! You can put any food you want into the pot, so the sky is the limit!
 
Nabe-Pa, which stands for ""Nabe Party,"" is very popular in winter among Japanese college students as they enjoy making and eating it together with friends.
 Let's get warm with some nabe in the cold winter, shall we?
