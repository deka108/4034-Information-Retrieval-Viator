Got 8 minutes? Check out this vlog about the beauty of the Philippines and genuine hospitality of the Filipinos.,"If this video doesn't make you want to visit the Philippines, then I quit. 

Almost every video I saw about the Philippines was about the islands. That's too shallow and easy. So I wanted to visit this country to make the best video on this country, and I think this is it. 

You won't see pretty girls on beaches in this video. You will see the real Philippines that I so fell in love with. 
To show you how generous people are, I lived on $0.00 for a day.
To show you how cheap the place can be, we threw a party for an entire village.
To shed more light on poverty, we bought a 1,000 burgers to feed people. 

This is my best video to date made in my favorite country to date. I hope you enjoy watching like I enjoyed making.

"Mt. Pulag has gotten a bad reputation for being too crowded but the National Park has improved the situation and worked on limiting the number of hikers to between 200-300 per day. In this picture, you can see a few hikers on top of peak 2, with the sea of clouds in the background. The playground of the gods actually felt like an actual playground where we could roam around without bumping onto other mountaineers!

If you do visit, please remember to #LeaveNoTrace! Ensure to use the established paths and avoid creating new ones. Also be respectful of other visitors by avoiding loud noises.

"Novelist Paulo Coelho said, “when we are on high we can see everything else as small. Our glory and sadness lose their importance. Whatever we conquer or lost remains there below.” I believe that, and that is why I love hiking because upon reaching the summit you feel a sense of greatness and yet you also feel humble – a contrast of emotions.

The Ambangeg trail is somewhat enchanting. We were like entering the world of Narnia, or the forbidden forest of Hogwarts.

There are many other lakes scattered in the vicinity of Coron, however 2 are only open to the public the rest are sacred to the Tagbanua indigenous people.

You've come to the right place, they said. After 36 hours of travel, we awoke to the brilliant yellows of sunrise reaching over, what seemed to be, infinite waters. We threw on our bathing suits, lathered on the sun lotion, and jumped on a boat set for the islands off of Palawan.

From what I gathered from past tropical destinations, I half-expected these islands to be bustling with tourists. Dropping anchor here was a stunning surprise, setting our sights on the surroundings with not another person in sight.

Having arrived here in the early morning hours on my lonesome, it was a perfect time to take in the sights and sounds of the forest before the day's hustle and bustle.

"Who's up for a drive?

During a morning cruise through the hills of Bohol, it was tricky to capture a piece of this journey from the ground alone. Especially when there's all of that never-ending green to process. The persistent winding made me pull over for this aerial shot, my hopes being I could better grasp the land and this joyride from above. Needless to say, climbing up and zooming down roads like Bohol's makes driving less of a chore.

"""I live for the road. Collecting experiences, versus that of materialistic belongings, will always be a goal of mine. This thought has always intrigued me, mostly because of the sense of appreciation for each. When it comes to experiences, we tend to only understand their importance in the long run. In the moment, we can of course enjoy them. However we may not be able to fully absorb their effect on us until much later on. On the other hand, materialistic belongings have their biggest value when first acquired. Like your mobile phone, for instance. The prized possession you couldn't take your eyes off of the day you brought it home, but has since become just another thing you have, and use. This is what propelled me to start traveling this past year, and I haven't looked back.

""As a filmmaker, photographer and avid traveler, I aspire to inspire through my work, both from my home base in the U.S. and around the globe.

""From the electric blue waters and lush palm forests, to the generous and heartwarming locals, there's no place quite like The Philippines. Having the opportunity to travel here and become immersed in its charm is an experience I cherish.""

As we were swimming after the school of scads, I felt a sudden rush of fear as thousands of them suddenly turned and swam towards us trying to get away from something.

I figured, a large predatory animal is on the other end chasing after its lunch. Luckily the predatory animals were just 5 hungry jackfishes snacking on some unlucky few.

"Five days in to our expedition from El Nido to Coron, we stopped at the most remote place I have ever been to in my life. Our objective was to trade several kilos of pork which we had previously butchered in exchange for a supply of fresh water. By then we were still a few hundred Kilometers from Culion Island. 

The community of 5 families we stopped at had access to a fresh water spring but would not take any form of currency. 

Looking back now as I write this, that was probably the most raw human experience I ever had having to trade and barter goods at a place where money had no value. 

I can vividly remember the proud look on my girlfriend Hayley’s face as we were sailing away, after she walked away with 5 fresh coconuts in exchange for a bottle of rum. I told her she lost that trade big time.

"Any plans for Saturday night? How about staring at the starry sky? This video taken in Guyam Island, Siargao, even shows us the Milky Way! Not bad for a weekend night! 

https://www.facebook.com/travelimagez/videos/vb.195718967444442/255967028086302/?type=2&theater","Time lapse scene of the milky way behind Guyam island, Siargao, Philippines. 

Guyam is a small deserted island of the coast of Siargao near General Luna. The island is visited daily by visitors on a boattrip or who come to just chill out for a while. It's a perfect little island with no facilities exept a toilet and 2 shelters. For a small fee the owner will allow people to stay on the island overnight. I've been in Siargao for over 2 months, the vibe of the island and the beauty of the surrounding islands make Siargao and incredible and addicting island. For a while have I been planning the right time to visit this island during the time when the milky way would be visible ánd when there would be no light pollution of the moon, also trying to lucky with clear weather. 

The milky is not visible like this with your own eyes, it is because of long exposure shots (20 seconds) that details of the milky way become visible and with postprocessing details and contrast are further enhanced. The settings used are ISO 1600, f2.8, shutterspeed of 20seconds. I used a D800 and 14-24mm lens, but any DSLR can capture this and even a good compact camera with RAW abilities.

"Apl.de.Ap There's a special place in my heart for the Puning Hot Springs. Located just outside of my hometown Pampanga, the Puning Hot Springs lay at the end of a mountain pass reached by 4x4 Jeeps. Once there, my friends and I were treated to a pool of natural hot springs and sand spa.
We feasted like kings and queens to a succulent lechon and lovely chorus of locals. This is something everyone must experience. So come experience my country and enjoy.

"The Philippine Hobie Challenge, the toughest regatta in the country, sailed on its 16th year with participants from all over the Philippines and the world. Over a dozen Hobie catamarans sailed up to 250 nautical miles through the waters and pristine beaches of some of the best islands in the archipelago, such as Mactan, Cabilao, Sumilon, Balicasag, and Siquijor. 

While the race serves as a platform for Hobie sailors to do what they love, it has also helped the very communities in these destinations. Non-government organization Waves For Water Philippines joined the race to help provide three islands with access to clean water. Through collaborations such as this, communities across the country are able to benefit from the growth and development brought about by tourism.

"LOOK: The Philippines takes over one of London's biggest and busiest Underground Stations! 

As part of the celebrations under the #VisitPhilippinesAGAIN2016 campaign, the Philippine Department of Tourism in the United Kingdom launched ""The Station Domination Series"" in one of London's busiest train stations, the Waterloo Rail Station.

Starting last 24 April 2016, the first ""Station Domination Series"" features a special immersion zone that gives commuters a feel of the Philippines' beauty and promise of an overall fun experience when they travel to the Philippines. The launch also coincided with one of UK's most anticipated events, the London Marathon 2016.

The ""Station Domination Series"" also gives commuters a chance to win instant prizes and a holiday to the Philippines in three fun ways. One is by taking “foot selfies” using our floor stickers mapped around the station concourse, second is by taking part in the 3D selfie stand, and third is by experiencing the Philippine islands through a 360 virtual reality pods with photos by photographer Rommel C. Bundalian. 

Apart from the experiential zone, the campaign also features a month-long Philippine branding presence on Europe's largest LED screen found also at the Waterloo Station.

"Last week, we've started featuring stories of people whose lives have improved because of tourism. These are successful stories of our tourism frontliners who prove how inclusive the tourism industry can be. Their stories are told by various local travelers around the Philippines whose journey would not have been more fun and much easier without the help they got from their newfound friends.

This week, we begin with the story of Jacob Maentz (@jacob.maentz on Instagram), a documentary and travel photographer from Cebu:

""I met Captain Angel Torres in Bais Bay during an early morning excursion to see the dolphins of Tañon Strait. Tañon Strait lies between Negros Oriental and Cebu and is the largest protected seascape in the country. It is home to spinner dolphins, dwarf sperm whales, spotted dolphins and pygmy killer whales. Today, a number of fishermen and other locals work part-time as captains or crew for some 15 boat tours around Tañon Strait, Angel being one of them. Visitors can get a glimpse of the marine mammals during early morning dolphin-watching trips.

""Back in the early 90’s dolphin meat was sold for P10 per kilo and was a common part of the local diet. Marine species would also be hunted for pure sport, mainly because no one knew any better explained Angel. In the mid-1990’s much of that changed when the LGU implemented a number of environmental laws to protect the dolphins and whales in the area.  Tourism now provides a livelihood for local fishermen and the marine life is better protected. ""

"To anyone who has shared moments over socials with our local mountain guides, exchanging stories in the campsite under starlit skies or along the trails, I'm sure one way or another, you've heard them share about how much their livelihoods have been helped by being a guide or a porter.

Carrying one's heavy pack along with the items of the rest of the group throughout the duration of the trek, which could last up to 10 or more hours per day depending on the trail, is something mountain guides and porters are willing to sacrifice for in exchange for a better source of income.

Where majority of our provincial lands' main source of livelihood rest in farming or fishing, most of these guides go back to such labor when they have no group to guide in the mountains.

But being a guide can earn four to five times more than what one can earn from fishing or farming in a day, and that is why they are willing to make the sacrifice and even eager to do so. At night in the campsite, they take shots of local rum, not to get drunk, but to ease their bodies from the pain and protect themselves from the cold. 

With better accessibility to the mountains, locals who lead groups visiting as guides or as porters, certainly have a better chance of living, and more money to feed their families.

We shouldn't take it against them for making a decent living out of being a guide or a porter. While there are those local communities who sadly and unfortunately abuse this opportunity, there are still those who do not and are very adamant about providing job opportunities for the locals while at the same time preserving the natural habitat of the mountains in their community.

From among these are the guides I met in Kanlaon Volcano in Negros. They limit climbers to 10 per day and require permits for any mountaineer visiting. They uphold the model for responsible mountaineering.

"2014 records from the Philippine Statistical Authority show that Tourism is now the 3rd biggest dollar-earning industry, next to Services and Semi-conductors. Among those who benefit from the earnings generated by Tourism are locals from touristic destinations who derive livelihood from it. Take the case of Kuya Eran Decena whose story is told by Cyrus John Malonzo (@the_boy_who_leaves on Instagram). 

""During my 2nd trip to #Coron, I met Kuya Eran Decena, who happens to be one of the well-known tour guides in town. He was famous that he was even featured on travel publication, Lonely Planet.

""My interaction with him indeed proved why he was well-known. First, he is very engaging and funny; there was no dull moment as we travelled from one island to the next. Second, he knows a lot about Coron, from affordable boat rides and accommodations to various detours for delicious local delicacies. And third, you can feel his love for his hometown, especially when he shared his efforts during the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda in Coron, as well as his concerns about commercial developments that pose threats on the island's pristine beauty.

""He said that when he started as a tour guide 15 years ago, there was only a handful of European foreigners visiting Coron. But with more flights and ferries leading to their town, the influx of local tourists has helped sustain their means of living. 

""He used to live in Manila and worked as a messenger for a multinational company before deciding to become a tour guide. I felt that he made the right decision because he is enjoying his job. He even promotes scenic photos of Coron on his own Facebook page. And I sincerely hope that when I get the chance to visit Coron again, he will still sport the same smile that we saw from him two years ago.""

"Did you know that in 2015, Tourism generated a record-breaking 4.9 Million employment? This was higher by 3.96% compared to 4.76 Million in 2014. At 4.9 Million, tourism's share to total national employment is estimated at 12.7%.

This figure, however, does not include those who indirectly benefit from the influx of travellers in their destinations. Take the case of a boatman from Carles, Iloilo whose story is told by Eric James Sotomil (@callmejames007).

""As the engine roared at the beginning of our 2-hour boat ride from Estancia to Isla Gigantes, so did the stories of our boatman.

"As summer in the Philippines draws near, we are giving you more reasons to travel around the country, not just for the beautiful destinations, but for the people with whom tourism matters: the frontliners. The people whose lives and livelihood are now dependent on this growing industry in the Philippines called tourism.

Our first story is from @vin_aranas87 (on Instagram) who traveled in May 2015 to Itbayat, #Batanes, the northernmost inhabited island of the Philippines. There, he met their tour guide, Kuya Pepe.

""We met Kuya Pepe on our second day and discussed with him our plans of reaching the #RafangCliffs on the eastern side of #Itbayat. Getting to this place needs some great deal of advice from him as he was the only person allowed to pass through private properties leading to Rafang Cliffs.

""Although he was Marine Engineer by profession, Kuya Pepe chose to stay in the island to be with his family and make a living out of tour-guiding. He explained that being a tour guide has helped him with much of their expenses; he was able to send his kids to school until they finished their studies.

""But aside from the fulfillment he gives his family, he also finds personal joy whenever he sees people enjoying their visit to Itbayat.""

"The Philippines is a proud host of this year's #RoutesAsia2016!

Routes Asia is the biggest strategy summit of route planners, gathering airlines, airports, and tourism and aviation officials, to plan their future destinations.

The country's hosting of this prestigious business event will allow the Philippines to showcase our destinations and soon-to-be inaugurated international airports in provincial cities such as Panglao in Bohol, Daraga in Albay, Caticlan and Kalibo in Aklan, and the expanded Clark International Airport and Mactan-Cebu International Airport. Existing international airports such as Manila, Davao, and Iloilo will also get their well-deserved attention.

As soon as these airports are opened, foreign travelers and Filipino workers abroad may now fly straight to their destinations, easing up foot traffic at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila.

Happening at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City from 06 to 08 March 2016, this year's Routes Asia is the biggest summit so far, bringing in 100 airlines, 200 airports, 50 countries, 1000 delegates.

"For sending best ""photo-fail"" shots, 3 lucky winners get free tickets to the Philippines
_______

Three months after kicking off 2016 with a social media contest, the Department of Tourism (DOT) announced on Friday, 19 February 2016, the three winners of the photo-fail challenge, each bagging a trip for two back to the Philippines. The contest encouraged foreign visitors to post their best photo-fails taken in the islands, highlighting their fun and candid experiences in the country.

Bannered under the theme ""Visit the Philippines Again 2016,"" this year's tourism campaign aims to attract repeat visitors and new travelers alike to come visit the country and relive the fun experiences they had with their friends, loved ones, and even strangers-turned-friends.

"""We Filipinos invariably associate rice terraces with the famous tourist mountain town of #Banaue. There are actually equally impressive sites, spread throughout the province of Ifugao, where one can wonder at these ancient engineering marvels.

""One of these is the more rustic town of Mayoyao, just a few hours drive from Isabela. Mayoyao's rice terraces are well-preserved and sit picture perfect in the early morning mist. There are plenty of viewing sites around the town where you can enjoy and marvel these renowned heritage sites.

"22-year old Canadian Vlogger Christian LeBlanc travelled around Asia in 2015 for 7 and a half months and had this to say: 

""...Every country has unique things to offer, but the Philippines is, by far, my favorite. I've never met a kinder group of people and a more beautiful landscape. The blues of waters, the most exaggerated landscapes, there is just so much to do!

""My time in the Philippines was unforgettable and i loved it so much that i'll actually be going back in 2016.""

Check out his HONEST review of his visit to some of the Philippines' top destinations, including Bohol, Cebu, Palawan, and Siquijor, through this Vlog and we hope you too get to experience how MORE FUN it is in the Philippines!

P.S. Just some minor corrections and suggestions:

(1) On the duration of tourist visa:
a foreign traveller can actually stay in the Philippines visa-free for 30 days and not 21 days, as stated in the video.

(2) The whole of Mindanao is not unsafe and there are equally beautiful touristic destinations one could visit in there such as Siargao, which is becoming a world surf haven; Cagayan de Oro, known for the wild river rafting; Davao, where the Philippines' highest peak, Mt. Apo, could be trekked; Camiguin, where you could swim in a carbonated water, and many more! :-)

"In the next few years, travellers and tourists visiting the historic Intramuros Manila will witness a more vibrant city, decluttered of spaghetti cable wires, as the Intramuros Administration has begun its underground cabling system initiative, in cooperation with power distributors and telecommunucations companies.

Last week, wires obstructing the sightline of Plaza Roma, from which the centuries-old Manila Cathedral is situated, have been finally removed, giving visitors, photographers, and Instagrammers a better view of the Cathedral.

This is just a preview of the big things to come.
Early next year, as part of the rehabilitation of Calle Aduana, the Intramuros Administration will begin to remove the rest of the poles and bury all the cables along this historic street, while redesigning its streetscape for a more pedestrian and bicycle-friendly environment.

"Eskaya Beach Resort & Spa is a beautiful resort-spa in Panglao Island, which is at the southernmost tip of the famous Bohol, Philippines. It is located halfway through Panglao along its coast facing the Bohol Sea. It is a sprawling property which covers 16 hectares. The topography of the resort is diverse. It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

"Eskaya Beach Resort & Spa is a beautiful resort-spa in Panglao Island, which is at the southernmost tip of the famous Bohol, Philippines. It is located halfway through Panglao along its coast facing the Bohol Sea. It is a sprawling property which covers 16 hectares. The topography of the resort is diverse. It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

Boracay, Aklan

What is it like? 
Ah, Boracay. Need we say more? Since much has been said, raved and written about this famous four-kilometer stretch of powder white sand paradise, we would like to suggest you try the most exhilarating activity off it — cliff-diving at Ariel's Point. The highest plank is about 15 meters high, which is as high as a five-storey building. But a jump off it ends with a safe, pleasantly wet landing.

Fun Fact: 
Not a lot of people know that Tribal Adventure Day Tours are offered on this island. These are no ordinary tours. You spend an entire day getting to know the indigenous people living In the area. The women will welcome you into their homes and even cook for your group while you learn about their history and customs. Ask around for D'Arcy Kelly. He runs the show.

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Zambales from Caloocan or Cubao (seven hours).

What is it?
In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

"Where is it? 
Taal Lake, Batangas

What is it like? 
Since 1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. The most recent large eruption was on this day back in 1965.  Although considered active, this small volcano has been quiet over the last few decades. As a matter of fact, now there are hiking tours and overnight camping packages on offer.

Fun Fact: 
Want to know what it's like to swim inside a volcano? You can in Crater Lake. It's said that the high sulfuric content has medicinal properties. Some people have even scuba dived here. But don't stay too long. The lake's water also has high concentrations of boron, magnesium, aluminum and sodium in salt form.

"Where is it? 
Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name “Bantayan sa Hari” (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to “Bantayan,” the name it's known as today.

Boracay, Aklan

What is it like? 
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact: 
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

Fun Fact: 
The mouth of a starfish is found in its center. Though it's hard to imagine, these creatures have intestines and a stomach. But they also have an ability to digest food outside their bodies, and so can feed on prey much larger than their mouths.

What is it like? 
Soft corals prefer nutrient-rich waters and less light. They may look like plants, but corals are marine animals that need food. And this type feeds on zooplankton, or organisms incapable of swimming against a current – making it the ideal treat for hungry marine creatures. You can find soft corals in Anilao's colorful underwater gardens, which are home to all sorts of tropical fish.

Fun Fact: 
Some soft corals are not actually soft. They're more tree-like and flexible, and can dance gracefully in the waves.

Caramoan, Camarines Sur

What is it?
Little is known is about the Caramoan Islands. Few people get to see this secret paradise. But a beautiful place like this won't be a secret for long. Adventurous types who have been to this island have enjoyed activities like kayaking, snorkeling, diving, limestone cliff-climbing, cave-exploring and stargazing. And they're likely to return, or at least spread the word about Caramoan's charm. 

Fun Fact:
Caramoan has an enigmatic hard-to-find lagoon. See if you can find it without the aid of a map!

Puerto Princesa, Palawan

What is it like? 
When fish swim in the same direction and in a coordinated manner, the behavior is called ""schooling."" But when they're together, interacting, it's called ""shoaling"". Fish shoal for protection against predators, better chances of finding food, and better chances of finding a mate – a shoalmate! You can watch schools or shoals of fish when you go snorkeling in Puerto Princesa's marine attractions, such as Honda Bay.

Fun Fact: 
Fish don't just randomly join a group. Like people, they pick who to hang out with – who their mates will be. And generally, they like large shoals with fish who are healthy and resemble their appearance. This is because a fish that stands out will be easy prey.

The place is lined with pine trees, and has a subtropical highland climate with temperatures going down as low as nine degrees Celcius during the cool months of December, January and February. ""The Summer Capital of the Philippines"" can get a little crowded during March, April and May, when people from other cities come for a visit to escape the urban heat. 

Fun Fact: 
Tam-Awan was built to showcase a model village of authentic Ifugao huts, which are expertly constructed without the use of nails. The compact huts are elevated to shoulder level by four sturdy wooden posts.

Bantayan Island, Cebu

What is it like? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name “Bantayan sa Hari” (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to “Bantayan,” the name it's known as today.

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Zambales from Caloocan or Cubao (seven hours).

The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Boracay, Aklan

What is it like? 
Ah, Boracay. Need we say more? Since much has been said, raved and written about this famous four-kilometer stretch of powder white sand paradise, we would like to suggest you try the most exhilarating activity off it — cliff-diving at Ariel's Point. The highest plank is about 15 meters high, which is as high as a five-storey building. But a jump off it ends with a safe, pleasantly wet landing.

Fun Fact: 
Not a lot of people know that Tribal Adventure Day Tours are offered on this island. These are no ordinary tours. You spend an entire day getting to know the indigenous people living In the area. The women will welcome you into their homes and even cook for your group while you learn about their history and customs. Ask around for D'Arcy Kelly. He runs the show.

Siargao, Surigao del Norte

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Surigao (one hour), then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a bus from Manila or Davao to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a boat from Manila to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Clark, Pampanga

What is it? 
It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

How to get there: 
Fly into Clark from Incheon, Singapore, or Hong Kong.

Or take a bus from Pasay or Cubao.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

Vinta Regatta Festival, Zamboanga

How to Get There:
Fly into Zamboanga from Manila, Cebu or Davao.

Or take a boat to Zamboanga from Manila.

What is it?
A vinta's sail is made up of vertical stripes of assorted colors that represent the colorful history of the peninsula's Muslim community. About a third of its population is made up of ethnic communities that give the region its unique flavor. These include the Tausugs, Samals, Yakans, Badjaos, and Subanens. Wait until you start hearing the people speak Chabacano – arguably the suavest-sounding dialect because of its heavy Spanish influence.

Fun Fact:
Vinta is also the name of a Moro dance performed to commemorate the migration of the Filipinos. Dancers imitate the movement of the vintas by balancing on the tops of poles.

"Where is it?
Pamilacan Island, Bohol

How to Get There:
""Fly from Manila to Tagbilaran.

Or take the Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry from Cebu to Tagbilaran.

Or take a boat from Cebu or any of the major cities in Mindanao to Tagbilaran.

Then take a van, jeepney or tricycle to Panglao Island.""

What is it?
This small, beautiful island is just a short boat ride away from the Baclayon pier. It’s famous for dolphin and whale-watching, so time your trip during the months these animals are most active.

Fun Fact:
There are ruins of an ancient Spanish fort on the island.

"Where is it?
Banaue, Ifugao 

What is it?
In Ifugao and every other part of the country, the best tour guides are the locals. They're knowledgeable, friendly and you won't have to worry too much about a language barrier. Filipino dialects may differ from region to region, but almost everyone speaks English. You're more likely to have an interesting conversation, than fumble with a phrase book! 

Fun Fact:
Don't be alarmed by the red-stained mouths of Banaue locals. It's caused by the chewing of nga-nga or betel nuts, which they find addictive.

Boracay, Aklan

How to Get There:
Fly from Manila to Caticlan.

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan.

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.

What is it?
Boracay kids have perfected the art of running, dropping a rounded plywood board into shallow surf, and skimming across the shore. The whole island is their playground. You shouldn't have any problems renting a board from them. But if you're a serious skimboarder, you'll want to head straight to Bulabog Beach.

Fun Fact:
Boracay Island is less than a kilometer wide.

"Where is it? 
Boracay, Aklan

What is it?
Ah, Boracay. Need we say more? Since much has been said, raved and written about this famous four-kilometer stretch of powder white sand paradise, we would like to suggest you try the most exhilarating activity off it — cliff-diving at Ariel's Point. The highest plank is about 15 meters high, which is as high as a five-storey building. But jump off and it ends with a safe, pleasantly wet landing. 

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Caticlan.

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan.

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.

Fun Fact: 
Not a lot of people know that Tribal Adventure Day Tours are offered on this island. These are no ordinary tours. You spend an entire day getting to know the indigenous people living In the area. The women will welcome you into their homes and even cook for your group while you learn about their history and customs. Ask around for D'Arcy Kelly. He runs the show.

This stunning photo of the San Juanico Bridge was shared to us by Ato Rosario. The San Juanico Bridge is the longest bridge in the Philippines and connects the two provinces of Samar and Southern Leyte. Connections. More Fun in the Philippines! ,"The San Juanico Bridge, is an arch-shaped truss bridge in the Philippines stretching from Samar to Leyte crossing the San Juanico Strait. It is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway. It is the longest bridge in the Philippines spanning a body of water with a length of 2.16 kilometers (1.34 mi) . It is considered one of the most beautifully-designed bridges in Philippines, having been designed by renowned architect Juanito Isko Balunbalunan, a once obscure architect from Tacloban City until the completion of the bridge and the fame for which it was later known. The bridge is supported by 43 spans rising 41 meters above the sea. It has a large arch beneath which allows boats to pass. It was designed by engineer Arvin Valderama and Christian Meynard Barnal and constructed over San Juanico Strait from Cabalawan, Tacloban City to the municipality of Santa Rita, Samar in 1969. It was completed in 1973.",240054519398747_532176270186569,itsmorefuninthePhilippines,"This stunning photo of the San Juanico Bridge was shared to us by Ato Rosario.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

How to Get There:
""Fly from Manila to Caticlan.

What is it?
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Tubbataha Reef, Palawan

What is it? 
Schooling is when a group of fish swim together in one direction. They do this to fend off predators by creating a “confusion effect,” where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

The Filipino word for hello is ""have you eaten?"" That gives you an idea of how important food is to the people of the Philippines. Fruits, vegetables, root crops and rice are staples of the Filipino diet. And with water crisscrossing every part of the Philippines, so is fish. A traditional way of preserving them is letting them dry out under the sun. This can give them a shelf life of at least one year.

Fun Fact:
Filipinos love pairing something sweet with something salty. An example of this is eating tuyo (salty, dried fish) with champorado (porridge with cocoa) for breakfast — a strange but surprisingly delicious combination!

Chocolate Hills, Bohol

What is it like? 
You’ll find these huge mounds that look like chocolate kisses scattered throughout the towns of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan in Bohol. Their numbers are estimated to be around 1,268 to 1,776.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Tagbilaran.

Or take the Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry from Cebu to Tagbilaran.

Or take a boat from Cebu or any of the major cities in Mindanao to Tagbilaran.

Fun Fact: 
Many myths try to explain the creation of the Chocolate Hills. In one of the legends, a giant fell in love with a human being. When she died, the giant cried heavy tears that formed the hills.

Boracay, Aklan

How to Get There:
""Fly from Manila to Caticlan.

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan.

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.""

What is it?
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact:
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!
