The part where it says ""so that you can talk to your grandparents"". 

An entire generation that built the nation has been alienated and another generation entirely brainwashed. And nobody notices, nobody cares and nobody can do anything about it.

This is my invention I made a few days ago to fight the governments consistent gang stalking that never stops . The U.S. government use silent sound RF frequencies to hack into your brain and administer mind control threw Tv and radio by using radio frequencies . This is the combination of over 2 and a half years work and building things and frequencies that work and heal the mind and body . I was working with only sound up until a few days ago and now I have built a RF frequency silent sound negative RF protection modulator using the 4 separate sound devices and several frequencies I have compiled that work to shut them out and shut them down for good . I don't have much money and if I did I could build a proper sound silent sound modulator that could be un hackable .Due to lack of funds I am using my computer and that is the biggest down fall of this mechanism because they can hack and piggy back off the media players and distort the frequencies from being how they should be .This could easily be solved with a stereo tuner and multiple sound devices and a mixer . All these things I do not have .Also with a more powerful transmission device I could heal the planet in a matter of days . Even the radiation from FUKUSHIMA could be healed in a matter of weeks if not days . Rf frequencies effect you on a molecular level and could do the same for water if a powerful enough Rf modulator was built broadcasting the Binural frequency called Radiation detox . Now I know why the U.S. Government takes it down when I put it on line for people to use for free . This frequency kills radiation .This could also be used to kill infected plants and people and The Earth infected with Chem trails and GMO . I am sure of it so please spread the word and please help me in any way you can . Be blessed and walk in the light .

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what’s around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to develop in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is

What is it like? 
By those who know about it, this ten-hectare hidden gem is adored for its supremely fine white sands. But the real adventure begins below the surface – with up to 30-meter visibility and an expansive reef, this marine reserve also provides a mystifying dive experience.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Calbayog or Tacloban.                                           Or take a bus from Manila to Tacloban.                                           Or take a boat from Cebu to Calbayog or Ormoc.

The island gets its name from the Cebuano word for bird, possibly owing to the two sandbars that stretch out like wings from its shores.

Because no one really believes""every school is a good school"".

It's that time of the year again where you look at school rankings that try not to have rankings but fail because everyone just looks at rankings and if there isn't an official ranking, people will make one up and the one that makes the most sense would become the unofficial, official ranking.

""Good"" is a relative position on a spectrum. For there to be ""Good"" schools, there have to be ""Bad"" schools too. That being said, academic results alone do not determine a ""good"" school. There are many other factors like environment, suitability, quality of staff, location etc. But certainly, some schools are better then others. And what's a ""Good school"" to you may be ""Bad"" to another.

The Decree offered a short stay - free visa for tourist from 75 countries whom intends to visit Indonesia. Those numbers exclude 15 countries and special regions which have been reciprocal Free Visa Agreements. Eventually, there are 90 countries in total. Wondering whether you can apply for free visa or not? Check the list here http://ow.ly/TcbeU
#WonderfulIndonesia ","And how about us, Indonesians don't get more free visa agreements?$$actually Indonesia should give all tourists/foreigners/expats from high and medium income level
countries a free stay of 60-90 days/2-3 months, or even 4-5 months. most of Indonesia does not
have any land border or ship/ferry lanes with other countries, so it usually requires foreigners
a usually not so low cost airplane ride to go out of the country and back again,
esp if staying in certain areas of Indonesia. also,  imagine if some foreigners had a situation
where they had to be out of the country but could not take an airplane and the visas could not be
extended any longer, what then since no land border and no ferry option?...$$Sute, maybe also bcoz there is too many of them around Bali, so maybe the govt got tired
of mostly only seeing Australians around Indonesia, esp Bali. :D :D
and the main reason the vast majority of tourists/foreigners/expats go to Bali is bcoz they r a bit afraid
to go to other regions, but me thinks maybe also bcoz there has not been enough promotion of say Sulawesi and other places.$$What a joke Australia is still not on the list.

Unless you know the culture and customs of countries all over the world, you can't claim that all these are uniquely Singaporean. For example, kiasu-ness is not, and people in Japan and Taiwan also avoid the priority seats in their trains. For them, it is the courteous thing to do because they do not fall into the categories for these priority seats. Who's to say our people are not doing so for the same reason? Also, how do you know people in other countries do not complain? As far as I know, they take their complaints even further, by picketing, striking, etc. Stop putting Singaporeans down with these derogatory comments.$$Yeah I understand of all of these and I do all of them$$Iam so sick of "" 6""...which is so irritating$$Complain everytime everywhere 😂 Katelyn So$$Hahahaha about 10 are completely true Cindy Wiggle Macadongdong.

Learn more at www.madridfusionmanila.com ","It's hard to eat such lavish meals in Manila with starving children sleeping on the streets only a block down the road.$$I have one advice to foreigners. NEVER go to the the capital city of Manila. The moment you arrive at the airport, you'll get hussled for money. Once you are outside of the airport, there's a big chance you'll get mugged, conned, stabbed or picked. Theres not much infrastructure for public services, there's extreme poverty in every corner. There's the worst traffic on earth, the worst pollution, the rubbish are strewn everywhere. Beaches are no longer prestine and there are too many people hassling you for money. The police are next to useless, the gov't is unstable, there are protests on a daily basis. There is nothing to see apart from old remnants of past colonizers. Prostitution and drugs are everywhere. The streets are flooded with illegal guns. There's the typhoon every month or every 3 weeks. There's the hot sticky muggy weather that is unbearable and just goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and lasts the whole year. And when your crappy holiday is over, you'll get squeezed out of your last peso at the airport. They have the airport terminal fee and something else.. also in cash! It must be paid in cash. Of course you can see that the cash disappears into thin air because the airport is so dilapidated that it earned the monicker: ""The worst airport in the world"" for 3 straight consecutive years!! So stay away.$$Just like in America ..., there are people with no food and shelter and  living under bridges or on the woods . Poverty is everywhere ..., not just in Philippines$$Dami nyo problema!

very delicious food. But then its just s noodles she's eating...maybe it taste very delicious.$$I think the Philippines should work on reducing the crime there. A friend who's visiting Bohol just got robbed there yesterday.$$And on second thought, no one's going to Manila until it fixes its dangerous image and gun problem.

Inextricably linked with the history of Sikhism, Amritsar is amongst the most revered sites of the world. It was founded as recently as the 16th century. Its name is a derivative of the Amrit Sarovar (pool of nectar) amidst which stands the Golden Temple, the most sacred of Sikh shrines. Accounts suggest that Guru Amardas purchased the land from Emperor Akbar and decided to build a tank at the site. Following his death, it was completed by Guru Ramdas and also came to be known as Chak Ramdas or Guru ka Chak. Some of the oldest markets in Amritsar, notably Guru ka Bazaar, date back to his time. The construction of the Golden Temple was initiated by Guru Arjan Dev while Guru Hargobind, who accorded the religion a martial temper, built the Akal Takht in 1606. Amritsar has a rich history encompassing various mythical and historical narratives including the epic Ramayana. It is believed that the site called Ram Tirath was Maharish Valmiki’s ashram, where Sita reportedly gave birth to her twin sons, Luv and Kush. The Gobindgarh Fort and Ram Bagh were built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire. While the Jallianwala Bagh continues to be the most evocative monument to India’s freedom struggle. The Khalsa College, established by visionary leaders at the beginning of the 20th century turned Amritsar into a hub of education. Also a centre of thriving industry since its inception, Amritsar is famed for its textiles, particularly shawls, and for its carpets. Amritsar has gained tremendous popularity for its gourmet traditions; especially the dhabas (roadside eatery) that churn out, amongst an inexhaustible list of delicacies, irresistible kulchas, chola-bhaturas, tandoori chicken and fried fish. Amritsar has all the makings of a well-rounded tourist destination; its ancient legends, historical monuments, places of worship, old bazaars, theatre traditions and colourful festivals all serve as a window to its robust past. Excursions to the Harike Bird Sanctuary and visits to the India-Pakistan border at Wagah are an absolute delight, while breaking bread or celebrating Diwali with the denizens of this hospitable city is without parallel.(Courtesy Punjab Tourism) ","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwoKgR0ZwMI$$Just for my friends living in India:

Taal Lake, Batangas

What is it like? 
Since 1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. The most recent large eruption was on this day back in 1965.  Although considered active, this small volcano has been quiet over the last few decades. As a matter of fact, now there are hiking tours and overnight camping packages on offer.

Fun Fact: 
Want to know what it's like to swim inside a volcano? You can in Crater Lake. It's said that the high sulfuric content has medicinal properties. Some people have even scuba dived here. But don't stay too long. The lake's water also has high concentrations of boron, magnesium, aluminum and sodium in salt form.

We travelled by foot and it was the most satisfying feeling in the world at its peak.$$Md Mehdi Hasanzz Please refrain from posting ads here to avoid being banned. Thank you.$$Yes! This is a great place to take your family for a weekend getaway. I can't wait to visit here again with my husband!$$A big misconception is that many people believe that Taal Volcano is part of Tagaytay City. It's not! It just happened that Tagaytay is one of the highest point in the area where you can have a perfect view of the volcano and lake.

Sadly however, development is taking its toll in Tagaytay. Condominiums rise up and threaten its natural scenic beauty.

You've come to the right place, they said. After 36 hours of travel, we awoke to the brilliant yellows of sunrise reaching over, what seemed to be, infinite waters. We threw on our bathing suits, lathered on the sun lotion, and jumped on a boat set for the islands off of Palawan.

From what I gathered from past tropical destinations, I half-expected these islands to be bustling with tourists. Dropping anchor here was a stunning surprise, setting our sights on the surroundings with not another person in sight. We scrambled for the snorkel gear, and dove into the blue to witness the vibrant coral and sea life. Day one on our adventure, and already one I won't forget.

Olu Deniz, a beautiful inland bay that stretches behind the cape, is now closed to yachts. The reason this heavenly place is called Olu deniz (""Sea of the Dead"") is attributed to the following legend;

Once a father and son were caught in a storm here and were in danger of sinking. The son claimed that if they approached the rocks ashore they could take shelter in a cove. The father on the other hand asserted that their ship would be driven onto the rocks and break up and that there were no coves around here anyway. In his terror of running around on the rocks, the father knocked his son (who was at the helm) into the sea with an oar and took over the helm himself. Just as the ship was about to hit the rocks on the cape, she turned into this calm, smooth watered bay. 

This is the reason they say the bay is called the Sea of the Dead, whereas what with the pine clad sandy beach stretched out like a tongue, the name ""Paradise Bay"" would be more fitting.

The Blue Lagoon of Olu deniz has calm, crytal clear waters which makes it ideal for a variety of water sports and a very safe place for children to swim. Part of the lagoon is now a protected area (and it`s a national park).

then one time I was watching a Historical Korean Drama, one phrase from the main actors dialogue sounds really familiar, bec he always say that to me. It was an old way to say 'I like You very much'.

Mr. Trump,

I try my hardest not to be political.  I’ve refused to interview several of your fellow candidates.  I didn’t want to risk any personal goodwill by appearing to take sides in a contentious election.  I thought: ‘Maybe the timing is not right.’  But I realize now that there is no correct time to oppose violence and prejudice.  The time is always now.  Because along with millions of Americans, I’ve come to realize that opposing you is no longer a political decision.  It is a moral one. 

I’ve watched you retweet racist images.  I’ve watched you retweet racist lies.  I’ve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy.  I’ve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to ‘pay the legal fees’ of those who commit violence on your behalf.  I’ve watched you advocate the use of torture and the murder of terrorists’ families.   I’ve watched you gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.   I’ve watched you compare refugees to ‘snakes,’ and claim that ‘Islam hates us.’  

I am a journalist, Mr. Trump.  And over the last two years I have conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of Muslims, chosen at random, on the streets of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.  I’ve also interviewed hundreds of Syrian and Iraqi refugees across seven different countries.  And I can confirm— the hateful one is you.  

Those of us who have been paying attention will not allow you to rebrand yourself.  You are not a ‘unifier.’  You are not ‘presidential.’  You are not a ‘victim’ of the very anger that you’ve joyfully enflamed for months.  You are a man who has encouraged prejudice and violence in the pursuit of personal power.  And though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are.

It called “KANNAZUKI 神無月”, literally meaning is ""the month when there are no gods"".
According to the ancient mythology, it is said that 8 million gods (Shintoism) of Japan gathered together annually at Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine (in Shimane prefecture) on the 10th month of the year. So only in this region the 10th month was called “KAMIARIZUKI 神在月”, the month with gods.

He gave up his only hobby (golfing) as he told me golfing took up a considerble amount of time and he rather spend his time with the family. 

He looks like a punctured tyre at the end of each day and my heart cannot help but cry when i see how tired he was. The fact that he did not utter a word of complaint made us appreciate him even more. He is a good husband, caring father and a filial son.

Hope to win and reward my hubby Edmund Joseph Tan for his hard work.$$For me, staycations meant taking time to smell the roses. It's a wonderful way to spend quality time together with my loved ones without the hassle of travelling overseas. And staycations truly revive our love for where we live!

Hoping to take this chance of a Staycay to recharge before the start of a hectic semester, and to explore the side of Singapore that we don't really go to.$$If I win I will make myself free to gather with my loved ones especially  with my precious mum. My mum is my superstar. She is always behind me no matter what I do. Never forgetting her unconditional love showered upon me, her relentless care and concern and intricate daily routine for the family.
My mum took charge of everything ranging from the household chores to taking care of the children. My heartpain whenever I see her dry and flaky hand due to constant soaking in detergent during washing. I came from a poor family. Life was excruciatingly hard and there was never a single day she was not struggling with small expenses. (just imagine the years of pain and hardships she encountered bringing us up since we were kids). The mental and physical burden weighing on her had never been lighter, but heavier as the list of expenses and expectations got more demanding as we grew older. Nevertheless I had never seen her fall sick, frown or complain dramatically over the intolerable level of hardship. She never once gave up nor chose to quit. She will ensure that we are well fed at the very bare minimum - which is what she always prioritize over everything.
She sacrifices to take care of us no matter how hard - such that everyone of us kids turned out well. She dotes on us more than anyone else in the world. Her advices are inspiring and enlightening. She led and taught us how to be good such that not a single of us siblings go astray in a poverty environment. I feel really heartpain and touched. She was frugal on herself but never hesitant to spend on her kids, esp on our education. I know she loves staycation but has refused to join me for that luxurious experience several times as she does not want to inflict that pinch on my financial pocket. I would like to repay her (get rid of some of her burden at the very bare minimum) and pamper her with this fabulous staycation - she really deserves such treat she needs, as she has sacrificed way too much for her kids. I cherish every moments with my mum for I know that time waits for no man and I do not want to miss any moment with her.

The winning of this magnificent staycation will be a very special treat, it will certainly bring happiness and a content smile on her face and laughter to my siblings as we enjoy the staycation together as a family. 

This splendid staycation will definitely be the most precious, meaningful, warming, enjoyable and memorable for everyone esp my lovely mum. Thanks for the awesome giveaway.
Hope to win and makes my dream come true!!$$Liked and shared! 

Hope to win for my deaf husband's coming birthday (November) as well as we married for 24 years. We had our honeymoon in Ramada Hotel in Gold Coast, Australia 23 years ago. 

It will be perfect gift to us. Thanks for this kind giveaway in advance.$$Liked and shared! 
Since my son (first one) was born a year ago, me and my husband never had a time just for both of us, especially with a 1 bedroom house with my inlaw stay with us to take care of my son while both me and husband are working daily. I hope and I really wish i could win this staycation. It would be a dream come true for both me and my husband. Thank you!$$Done!!! My cousin's 2year old birthday was held there, and they bought a package for a staycation at Zhongshan park hotel, where there was a buffet spread the day after and allowed their guests (inc. my family ) to try out their amazing variety spread of buffet. The hotel was very picturesque , and furthermore I had also uploaded my ootd at the little lake/ pool as the background further point the contrast of my outfit. It's a nice tranquil place and I hope I can win this for my family and close friends to stay and chill there, over a peaceful atm, away from the hustle and bustle of sg$$Liked & Shared
This Staycation Giveaway is indeed something I really need. The past year as been a hard toll on kids and myself. I really need a break to just relax and clear my mind. Nevermind which one but will really appreciate this chance to get to cause I've never been on a staycation let alone a trip for myself.... I deserve to just pamper myself, recharge, let go of all the stress and come back to my kids a better mum... happier and fresh.. So looking forward to the good news ...Thank you... 😌$$Liked and shared! What an awesome giveaway! My mum birthday is nearing and she has been really tired and never enjoy much of her life, and other than treating her sumptuous food, I hope she also can enjoy staycation in sg. And definitely the buffet is mouth drooling for her. 😂 This giveaway comes at the right time! I hope I can win this and surprise my mum! Thanks. 💜👍$$Liked & Shared.

Will be traveling to Seoul to meet my niece for the first time and I was thinking hotel. But with all the wonderful reviews and opinions on hostels, I think I changed my mind. I will also try to incorporate a stay in an hanok. Thanks everyone :)$$3 - guest houses these days are comparable to hotels with sufficient comfort at a good budget...leaves you more pocket for many other activities to do in Korea :)) 

I wish to try 4 someday too.$$I've been to korea 4 times.. I'm prefering hostel because it's cheaper than hotel.. most of the hostel in korea are very clean and comfortable and worth for money.. since i'm a budget traveller.. i'll choose hostel as my fav accomodation most of the time during my stay in korea..😁$$I always look for guesthouses since I travel alone most of the time. The price is quite affordable for people who don't mind small rooms and average cleanliness. You also get to meet new people during your stay~$$I haven't been to Korea , it depends on how much budget you have and where to go . For us who does not have a lot of money , but enough to visit Korea , a good budgeted place is much more affordable for us . Hanok will be good and a good affordable tour guide will be good .. I would love to experience to be living among Koreans , your culture , food , and much more . Thanks 😜$$Definitely hostel, the cheapest and most of the hostel near to public transport station.
I went twice to korea, i hope my 3rd time can be a hanok, wanna try... haha...$$It depends on my budget for the trip ~ but mostly my 1st priority is hostel bcos by staying in the hostel I can meet other travellers. However, occasionally I would like to stay at the hanok to experience the traditional culture of Korea or at the hotel as a reward for my self ^^$$Since I am a budget traveller, I always stay in hostel/guesthouse whenever I travel to Korea. But I also want to try to stay in a hanok if I can find an affordable one near the subway.$$for my 3 times visiting Korea, i stayed at hostel/ guesthouses. much cheaper and its clean. no problem at all. and i am comfortable with the staff :)$$Its depends on the budget. I would like to stay at the hanok house. If i travel with my family, i like everyone stay together.$$We came to Korea last fall and stayed in an AirBnB near Seoul Station. Is was really affordable for 2 people and close to everything! We plan to do it again this fall when we come back.$$I have never been to Korea, but that is in my plan. 
I think, because I love the classic style and history I would choose Hanok. That is beautiful, traditional, there is the soul of the Korean architecture. However I know that is expensive, I would choose it for just a short time period, than move to a hostel. There you can meet with lot of lovely people and that is not expensive, so you can save your money as well.$$For a budget traveller like me and sometimes solo traveller, hostel/guesthouse because it's cheap and I get to know new friends and it feels homey with the local owners/receptionist. I learn more about the culture. Money saved on the accommdation will be splurged on food and shopping. Still on my list on my list is the Hanok stay.$$I have been to Korea twice and have stayed there for a month each.  For a long staying traveller like me, I prefer to stay on a guesthouse considering the budget for accommodation.  I have stayed on guesthouses in Hongdae, Busan, Jeju and PyeongChang and everything was clean and organized.   The owners are very welcoming and helpful.  But I would love to try Hanok someday. Do you have any recommendations on affordable hanok to stay in?  감사합니다.  😊$$For my next trip I'm definitely staying at a Hanok house!!! I love the architectural beauty and simplicity of these houses and I've always wanted to stay in one. My last trip I stayed at an airbnb, I wasn't impressed.$$Hostel/guesthouses because usually it feels as if you are staying with a friends family so you learn more about the local culture. There is more of a personal touch. And Hanok stay also was surprisingly comfortable and a very unique experience. Anyone who visits Korea should try it at least once.$$I have stayed in AirBnB places and have found it much more affordable, especially since I can cook a few meals and do laundry easily. I would love to try a hanok but there is no way I could sleep on the floor.$$For my second  trip to Korea Ihave booked Hostel in the Hongdae area in Seoul as I love this area very much and would  like to meet other people$$Hanok. I always got good price and the experience was perfect. Due to the small size of the Hanok Guesthouses I could create a friendly relationship with the owner, they even acted like being my mother :), by which l could get closer to real Korean life.$$Annyeong KTO teams, i prefer to choose hostel because it's cheaper and affordable for me ... But someday i want to try to stay in a Hanok because it's very unique and beautiful. I want to feel how to stay in Korean traditional house like i usually see in Kdrama. Kamsahamnida 😄$$Hanok and I'd like to try to rent an apartment one day to live the Korean life but I think its so expensive.

2. Recommend other unique Korean foods that didn’t make the list below!

Don't forget to share this with your friends on their VisitKorea trip as well!😘 ","I would love to try ganjang gejang. Seafood, especially crab, is one of the most vibrant and famous cuisine in Indonesia since it has so many islands which are surrounded by sea. So everytime I eat seafood here, it will reduce my homesickness. Crab is also my favorite food, it already tastes good without any seasoning. So I can't imagine how it will taste in soys-marinated sauce. I guess it will taste fantastic!

I suggested 'Gwamegi' (과메기) for you guys. When the winter season starts, one of my senior from Pohang gave me gwamegi. It is a famous half-dried fish which mostly eaten in the region of North Gyeongsang Province. My senior told me, we can only eat this kind of fish in winter season because it needs to be repeated freezing-defreezing outdoors. It tastes sweet, sour, rough, a little bit spicy; all in the same time. It is perfect to be consumed with garlic, chili, vinegared red pepper paste, wrap them around dried seaweed, and accompanied by a bottle of soju or beer. 🤤

Cc: Wendy William Christian Chandra Marcel Hidajat Winarto Hermawan Prajitno Aldo Pollardo Vincent Wirawan$$My Korean friend brought us to taste Sundae Soup on our first visit to Korea in 2012. Had Ddeokbokki and other street foods at Pochangmacha in Jeju for our dinner. Then we went to Gwanjang Market in 2014 to eat Sundae and Gopchang. For Hongeo, it's an accident for me... because Jeonju Makgeolli House served all sort of excotic foods as anju (안주) to consumed with Makgeolli. To be frank, if I knew it's Hongeo I won't eat it. It's an accident as I thought it's hoe (회). As a sashimi lover, I just put the whole slice inside my mouth. The aftermath was horror to my mouth... really shocking experience to mouth, my tongue and my nose! Stinky ammonia smell like public toilet was really unbearable. I had to drink makgeolli and haejangguk to cleanse and purify contaminated area by the smelliest food I ever had in my life.😱😱😱  My hubby ate the Snails and Beondegi too. He had tasted Beondegi at Soraepogu Fish Market and he said it tasted nice. But, knowing that it's silkworm pupa I just too hesitate to put it inside my mouth unless I'm drunk~! Maybe I'll challenge myself to eat this Beondegi and Sannakji next time! 😶$$I would say Beondegi but I tried that last November during my #VisitKorea trip beside the Cheonggyecheon stream so in April I'd like to try the Hongeo 😍. i expect this to be a little slippery but tasty. I am so looking forward to it.$$I would like to challenge myself with this....Cheonggukjang AKA “Dead Body Soup”. They say its odor is so strong and repellant to many. The soybean paste used for this soup is only briefly fermented, which means that much of its strong ammonia smell remains. It has largely whole soy beans which stick together with a slimy, gluey substance. But, despite the dreadful description and smell,they say it's incredibly delicious. Victor Valle Otero$$I would try them all, but since I have to chose only one, I think I'll side with Dak Bal. I also like pig feet and reeeallyyy spicey things, so it would be similar I think. Alsooo, I want to try bingsu so much... it's not as special as the others on this list, but those look absolutely delicious.$$I want to challenge myself with these two korean foods which are Maeun Ddeokbokki and Ganjang gejang. First, I want to try the one which is the Maeun Ddeokbokki. I saw this food in one of the korean drama. The first time I saw this food was I already think that this food was really good. I want to challenge myself to eat more spicy food like this spicy rice cake because I want to try to eat rice cake with mix of chili sauce. The one thing really good to this food is its easily purchased from street vendors anytime you want to eat this. 

             Since Im young I really like seafoods that's why Im anticipated to try Ganjang gejang because I want to try new taste and new meal beside of fried crabs. I want to eat this dish that made by raw crabs marinated in soy sauce. I will eat this crab meat with rice even with my bare hands until the last bite of it. 

        I recommend to others to try the stir-fried jjukkumi that marinated in red chili sauce because it has a great taste and good for health.$$안녕하새요.. I would like to challenge both 간장게장 (soys – marinated crab) and 닭발 (chicken feet) dish .. I would love to try  닭발 because I once saw Apink Chorong eating it on Apink Showtime and for 간장게장 , I fell in love for it when I saw Running Man member eat it on the show. There are various type of Korean dish that often shown on Korean dramas and reality shows. 
This event is good because it can introduce unique Korean dish to non Koreans. Based on my experience, I would like to recommend 떡볶이 (tteokbokki) for those who craving for late snack and tteokbokki cheese for those like less spicy food. And for those that want challenges, eat Beongdegi (번데기) (steamed silkworm larvae). 감사함니다 ~ <3$$I would try a few. The sundae (blood sausage). Gopchang (intestine) Hongeo  (skate) and Ganjang gejang  (soy marinated crab) sounds amazing. I actually have had maeun ddeobkbokki (spicy rice cake) I love spicy food but it was too hot for me.$$I would like to try 떡볶이 (ddeokbokki)!! I'm really in love with kdramas and this meal is very popular among them...I love spicy food and ive been told that ddeokbokki can be spicy so that sounds great.....

Another meal I would like to try but also i would recommend is ""heotok"" wich is the korean version of pancakes, right?? So thats it (theres a lot of meals Id Like to challenge like ""bulgogi"" or ""jajjamyeon"" i expected both to look and be appetizing)

Cant wait to try them all~~!!$$I would like to taste the Sannakji because this is what I am looking for when visiting Korea, to see and taste things I could not anywhere else. Seafood is what is not avaible everywhere. And if I like it, then the ganjang gejang can come. 🙂$$When I visit Korea one day I really want to try kimchi. I know it's not on the list but I love cabbage and fermented cabbage just sounds delicious. I am so curious about the street food there.$$I think Dwejimori, Ojingeochae, Bosintang and Onnuriye Donkatsu are challenging enough, but maybe with enough Makgeolli they will be just fine. 짠!$$I'd like to take on the Dak bal (chicken feet) challenge. I expect it to be gut-twisting spicy but my skin would glow from all the collagen I ate.$$탕탕이!!! 
I really want to try 육희낙지탕탕이!!  Minced raw beef and nakji with raw egg. Been wanted to try it since I watched Eric oppa made it on three meals a day.$$It'll be hard but I want to challenge Beondegi and Hongeo. They both are known to have strong smells so it'll be a hard challenge :)$$I would challenge the ganjang gejang. I'm not really big on sea food but crab marinated in soy sauce doesn't sound too bad !$$I would to try Beondegi (Pupa) ^^ After watch my friend's video about challenge to eat beondegi, i really curious about the taste, is it yummy ?? ㅋ But i think i'm so scared to eat it .. In Indonesia, we know about the food like beondegi, but we can't find it easily like in Korea. And yeah it full of protein and vitamin, i think i should eat beondegi as snack at my office if i'm feel so hungry 😂
Let's watch my friend's video ⬇
https://youtu.be/VQdEbmw-hW4

And i would to recommend Onnuriye Donkatsu (Pork cutlet). Just see this photo and you can feel the hoooooottttt ~~~ I really don't like spicy food but i would to try this one, maybe just a little 😅

If you want to try this, you can find at Onnuriye Donkatsu, 355-23 Sindaebang 2-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul; +82 2 823 8589

Thank you Korea Tourism Organization - VisitKorea for this event, so we can share about Korean food and get more new information about many Korean food 😁❤ #VisitSeoul #VisitKorea$$I would like to try Hongeo! I just simply want to know how bad it smells like.$$Challenge Accepted!
I would like try Dak Bal (Spicy chicken Feet). I really really like spicy foods. It's very temptating and make your body hot especially in the winter like now. In Nepal, we can find many nepalese spicy food but I would like to try it. I like the spicy food and it makes the food very delicious and make me sweat if i eat that. I like Korean Food because it's very delicious, flavour, spicy and have a unique taste. So i really really want to taste Dak Bal if i visit to 'Korea'. And taste in street food market like i watch it in K-Drama or any vlogs, it makes me so temptating 😋😋😋 #Korea_Food #Food_Lovers #VisitKorea ✌$$I would like to try 순대 when i visit to Korea.

Calanggaman Island, Leyte

What is it? 
By those who know about it, this ten-hectare hidden gem is adored for its supremely fine white sands. But the real adventure begins below the surface —with up to 30-meter visibility and an expansive reef, this marine reserve also provides a mystifying dive experience.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Calbayog or Tacloban

Fun Fact: 
The island gets its name from the Cebuano word for bird, possibly owing to the two sandbars that stretch out like wings from its shores.

… but these “monsters” are actually known as the Juhyo phenomenon. Strong winds over a nearby lake carry water droplets, which flash freeze on tree branches to form horizontal icicles. When enough falling snow settles on these icicles, the snow monsters of Zao are born.
The Juhyo season is typically from end of December to the end of February. The frosted trees are most prominent in January and the number of snow monsters peaks in the following month with increased snowfall. Discover the mystic world of the Juhyo and stick around for the world-class skiing and hot springs!

The best way to describe the Beatiful Destinations team is they represent a sector of travel that is very adventurous. They like to go where people have never been before. They like to look at familiar places from a very unfamiliar attitude. So what they're saying is, this is what is the most incredible experiences that they've had. Now the advantage of this is, because of their unique perspective, they're sending out images of the Philippines that even we have never seen before, at least from the perspective that they have. And that's a tremendous boost for us.Are you following Beautiful Destinations on Instagram and Facebook? You should be. They just visited the Philippines! Our chief correspondent Pia Hontiveros speaks to the Beautiful Destinations team and to Tourism Secretary Mon Jimenez.","good move for our Tourism agency. :)$$It's great that so many more people are appreciating the Philippines I only hope that the boom does not damage / destroy the natural beauty.$$Good job Sec Jimenez!!

The German legends simply outcast the England team in general. They have several World Cup experience in depth in almost all individuals. Though I may said that Lothar Matthaus is one of the finest World Cup winning captain, I would prefer to meet TEDDY SHERINGHAM in person instead.

For one simple reason when Man United claimed the treble trophy in 1999.  I am among ONE OF THE MILLIONS Manchester United fans around the world n Singapore who loves watching his goal against Bayern Munich back then.

Big Teddy is my hero...forever!
I am all set to meet him and have prepared a jersey for him to sign and have a photo with him. I hope my December birthday wish comes early this time round.

Thank you, NUEVO VINO and TheSmartLocal.com for this contest opportunity!$$After Paul Scholes announced his retirement in 2013, football lost an icon. Now, I have the chance to watch the best English player plays. It will definitely be an eye opening experience!$$Throw away club rivalry and bring on national pride. Every legend players counts. 1st time SG is honoured to have the battle of Europe. Who can forget the 5-1 England beat Germany with goals from Heskey, Gerrard and Owen and of course Didi Hamman for scoring the last goal in England old Wembley. Revenge is surely on the card with countries at stake. Didi is surely the one that I love to catch him in action again as he once scored a stunner against Man Utd last year. We are blessed to have great sponsors for such a great sporting event in this part of the world Asia. Way to go !!! 

Thank you and wish me luck.$$Wow! I look at all the comments the competition among the hardcord fans is strong, especially all the collectibles they have!! I wonder would I still have a chance to win this, nevertheless still gonna try.

I would like to see Paul Scholes!! I remember during my secondary school days watching all the matches he played and playing it on fifa. and Paul scores! Those were my younger days. This is a match not to be missed by all the legends. Match of a lifetime!$$Paul Scholes!!! Not only he played for my beloved Man Utd football club ...He is a true midfield maestro not only he can tackle, and his passing and shooting is of the highest level. to meet him will be a dream come true for me!$$Without a doubt, I hope to meet Teddy Sheringham as who can ever EVER forget his exploits in Man United champions league final against Bayern Munich!!! Even though I am a gooners fan, I just have to applaud Teddy as considering his age, he shouldn't even be playing with that much intensity!!! Heck, for me at that age, even climbing the stairs up 7 storeys will make me panting for breath every step!!! At 50 years old this year, Teddy deserves the accolades for a successful career and I definitely can see him scoring at least 1 goal in the match!!!!

So KUDOS to the main man Teddy and I hope to shake this legend's hands and oh ya, I need to get this gold plated card of Teddy signed!!! So give me a chance to fulfill my dream!!! Thanks, TheSmartLocal.com and NUEVO VINO!!!$$Can't wait to catch DIETMAR HAMANN in action, cos he is one of the best Defensive Midfielders of his time and well more importantly hope to meet him cos I missed getting his autograph the last time out :)$$Hope to get a chance to finally watch the Ginger Prince Paul Scholes play in real life and not on tv as I have twice failed to catch his matches during my time in England. Always a step ahead of everyone else as per Luis Figo's quote ""I am star-struck when I see Paul Scholes because you never see him. On the pitch you can't catch him. Off the pitch he disappears.""$$Definitely Paul Scholes for me !! Seeing him in action on TV and in real life will be totally different experiences !! I am surely looking forward to the game !!$$I would like to see Paul Scholes live in action because my favorite epl club is Manchester United and Paul Scholes is a of one the legend star player in the club.$$It would have to be Paul Scholes; I first met him in 2014 before Ryan Giggs' first game as interim manager against Norwich City. I jokingly queried if he was going to make a second comeback, having previously been coaxed out of retirement by Sir Alex Ferguson. To the disappoint of the fans, he said ""no chance mate""! 

On top of being such an affable character and a man of few words, he used his performances on the pitch to do the talking. The long and varied passes that were pinged with such accuracy, something that Manchester United is currently lacking. He was the one who made me understand that football was more than just about scoring goals; he made playing football seem so effortless.

He is the sheer epitome of all-round talent, and I do hope that I would get to meet and see him grace the pitch again.$$give me a CHANCE to CHEERS with Emile Heskey again maybe this TIME we shall TOAST with wine anyway he BREAKS through DEFENCES like NOTHING$$Paul Scholes. Cos he once challenged C.Ronaldo to hit a tree 50m away in 1 shot and he won hands down! That guy can pick a pass when no one else can!$$I wanna see stuart pearce, gareth southgate n chris waddle take penalties against germany again... ;p$$Definitely Daniel Ben Murphy!

These boots are made for shooting, and that's just what they'll do, and when we get to Singapore Sports Hub for #BattleOfEurope by NUEVO VINO and Masters Football #MastersFootball #Singapore

We keep saying we'll do something new, rest assured that's what we're gonna do. The Kallang Wave to Wow. :)$$I want watch the ginger prince score a screamer at our national stadium.$$I want to see Paul Scholes in action.
In year 2001, Paul Scholes visited Singapore with his teammate. I was studying my O Level during that time. I told my mum I want to travel to Singapore to watch the team played especially Paul Scholes who is my idol since I was a kid. My mum said she will pay all my expenses if I can score straight As in my O' Level. This motivated me so much and I managed to visit Singapore and watched the team played. 
Without him, I may not have so much motivation to excel in my O' Level. So now I got the opportunity to thank him in person. I wish NUEVO VINO & TheSmartLocal.com can give me the opportunity to meet my idol. Thanks.$$Paul Scholes and Teddy Sheringham vs Jurgen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff$$I want to see Steve McManaman in action at our National Stadium on Nov 12! He is from my favourite Team LiverPool. Steve McManaman is the first Englishman to win the Champions League with a non-English club and also the first English player to win it twice! Remarkably Remarkable! Really hope that I can win this and be there to support him!

http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20151208-smile-youre-in-asias-friendliest-metropolisDinner in Manila or cocktails in Makati. Why you should do business here.","I've just visited Manila last 3 weeks, and I almost agree with this article.  By showing their politeness everywhere, especially when you go across the street and get the invitation from driver, the Philippino's behaviours actually inspired us so much when I came back to my country. I definitely will come back Philippin for another trip. And I suggest that you should come here at least one time in your life and get your own evaluation. Every judgement on paper is only for references.$$Ella May Agustin it says, The first thing you’ll notice about Manila are the stares you attract from locals. No one grows up in this city being told that it’s impolite to stare, so the habit has just stuck. Don’t worry, these are just curious glances and the only response is a friendly smile.$$It is said friendliest NOT safest...which is means the true nature of legitimate productive individual of a certain area (manila /manileños). There are bad elements everywhere and there are certain areas (locals and internationals) that are not that friendly. 
Not all legitimate manileños lives in manila anymore ...so one may encounter the wrong people.
It is said ""walang tao na nagkakalat sa sariling bakod"".
Manila had been flocked by local and international tourist. Legitimate manileños welcome them with open arms and later abused their hospitality and enviroment. Some manileños were forced in anyways to live outside their domain.$$Lets be honest, Manila is not tourist friendly with all those snatcher, pick pocket and other scammers roaming around the street of Manila looking for the next victim.$$Yes friendly people but also the most rude people of any country I have been. And Manila? What a joke.$$Ah well I still think it's a lovely place and yes I have had the taxi driver experience except my Filipino partner saved me. Like any city you always need to be careful. Never been pick pocketed in Manila or anywhere in the Asia but have been in London England!😡$$To my mind taxi drivers are to foreigners the unofficial ambassadors of any capital city.
The way the majority of Manila taxi drivers have behaved over the Christmas period is nothing short of a disgrace.
You have a long way to go before you can truly be regarded as the friendliest to foreign visitors.$$Even my Philipino friends avoid Manila when possible and I don't think Manila is a good advert for the rest of the country, which is beautiful. My experiences of Manila are unfortunately all bad. Out of there as quickly as possible and head to other places asap :)$$Thank you for sharing this. As a Filipino, I would definitely prefer to spread news around the world that we are a nation with goodness. We offer the best hospitality service in the world and we have a lot more to offer. With a growing tourism industry, we need to help with the promotion by simply asking our fellow colleagues to come and experience it for themselves simply by sharing news such as this. I KNOW we have issues that are yet to be dealt or currently being and I DO ACKNOWLEDGE that...but c'mon mga Pinoy and Pinay: is it so hard to share something good about our country?

Merry Christmas and an advance Happy New Year to all!$$Those who had bad experiences, (patawad) sorry. My personal appologies. You went to the wrong places. Philippines is generally a peaceful, friendly country. Im speaking in behalf of the multitude of Filipinos who strive to be good. We own it up. But we are up for the change. We are almost there. Thank you for coming and please arrange your next visit. Change is at hand.#duterte2016$$But the overcrowded place is  Manila hhahaha...$$Oh Manila is not Philippines.  Get over it. Have you been to other cities outside manila.. people can be so negative
. New York can be filthy and dirty to me if your brain is working all right.$$PROUD TO BE FILIPINO! ASHAMED OF OUR GOVERNMENT SYSTEM!$$I don't generalize there are good and bad people every where not only  in Manila. Philppines is a beautiful country that's for sure but province life is the best$$hahahahaha   especially the taxi drivers ,,,,,$$what? friendliest? paki double check. I am not against it. I am actually happy but it was not friendly when I was still in the Philippines. (Terrible traffic, pollution (air, garbage, etc).$$Social engineering has done a marvelous job, based on the comments this post has garnered. This way of thinking degrades the thinker. Manila is unable to rise above such diatribes because its population has been steadily fed what is bad about it and not encouraged to overcome imperfection and strengthen what is good. Careful, a nation divided against itself easily falls.$$One of the most dangerous city in the world. One of the most  corrupt  country in the world .

In Japan, Buddhist temple bells are rung 108 times beginning at midnight on New Year’s Eve.
Why 108 times? One explanation for the bell-ringing is that this is done to forswear the 108 human desires.
Some temples allow ordinary people to ring their bells, so check the temples near you if you are in Japan. Or hear the sound of the bells and welcome the New Year!

A ritual called Pranapratishhtha, which involves chanting of mantras by the priest, is performed. Clay idols of Lord Ganesha in various shapes and sizes are brought and placed in homes and pandals. Special Ganpati prayers, songs and devotional chanting are also part of the occasion.In Maharashtra, people purchase clay or metal idols of Lord Ganesha and worship them for one to ten days.

1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
By which also ye are saved, if keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

ROMANS 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

1 JOHN 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

God loves you so very much:))

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

1JOHN 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye believe on the name of the Son of God.

God loves you so very much! All of us are sinners in this world who have sinned and rebelled against a holy righteous God and because of sin we have to face death one day. Sin is the reason we die.God came down to earth as a man in the flesh named Jesus Christ. Jesus became the light of the world to save sinners from their sins. Jesus died on the cross for your sins, shed all of his blood, was buried, and rose again three days later, according to the scriptures. He took your place of punishment for your sins so if you truly believe in your heart on Jesus and all that he did for you and put your faith and trust in his blood that was shed for your sins and trust in all he did for you on the cross, you may know that you have everlasting life and you will be saved the very moment you truly believe in your heart. God sees the heart of man. Will you believe on Jesus Christ today with all of your heart and trust on him and the shed blood that was shed for your sins?

Jesus is God manifested in the flesh!!!

JOHN 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

JOHN 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to heaven! There is no other way. No man, priest, pastor, church, religion, works, baptism, nothing but through Jesus Christ!

JOHN 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

ACTS 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

JOHN 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

1 PETER 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

We are all sinners and we are going to die one day and need to be saved from our sins to go to heaven

ROMANS 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.

ROMANS 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

ROMANS 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROMANS 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

We are saved ONLY by GOD'S GRACE!

EPHESIANS 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

ROMANS 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

REPENT, turn to Jesus Christ, put your faith and trust in him alone, truly believe on him and all he did for you.

JOHN 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

MARK 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

EPHESIANS 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise,

When you truly believe on Jesus with all of your heart call upon him from your heart..Salvation is a heart decision and comes from the heart.

ROMANS 10: 9-13 If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

The very second you BELIEVE in your heart on Jesus Christ and all he did for you on the cross for your sins cause God sees your heart and call upon the name of the Lord from your heart you will be saved. Salvation is a heart decision..Whoever comes to Jesus Christ he will in no wise cast out..Come to Jesus today and  get saved today..",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

❤️Avid fun..yours truly! Will visit your heartwarming country  in four seasons as soon as I can! Tyvm;)$$For me,,  should be B. But it'll be better if it provided with some photos too :) People may think KTO is for tourists only. But for me who have stayed in Korea for almost 8 months for study, i really think that this page n website is very functional esp for break holidays. I think KTO should provide more informations about unfamiliar places in Korea. And also for guide how to get there,, food and accomodation available there, and maybe some activities availabe. And it should be great if KTO provide some informations about the transportation, such where can we rent a van or a bus for trip :) last summer break, we had gone for a really enjoyable trip because of informations provided in KTO 💜💜 thank u KTO :D So i hope to see others to enjoy their trip during their stay at Korea too like me n friends. $$For me both A. Photo/video-oriented content and B. Information-oriented content, because these can easily captivate or fascinate the interest of the excursionist or rubbernecker. They are both functional especially to me as non native because during my free time here in Korea, KTO page will be my guide in exploring interesting and beautiful places were in photos, videos and information about the places that can be seen in Korea will help in motivating us because it will be delivered complex information through a real life context. Kamsahamnida Korea Tourism Organization$$I think both. A. Photo/Video - oriented content, and B. Information - oriented  content. 

     They are same useful and very effective way to attract  travelers to visit a place like Jeju island, Seoul Namsan tower, Suwon Hwaseong Fotress and other tourist destination  or to go around the city like Seoul, Incheon, Busan and other places in Korea by using transportation system  like bus, subway, taxi and other mode of transportation or going to event and festival or want to taste korean food specially kimchi. Both content  with specific details it really makes help to the travellers to explore more about Korea and to go in a place/tourist destination with a organize plan and schedules.

     Base on my experience i always  love to visit a place with a brief knowledge about the place and specially always inspire me a lot to visit a place where i'm going on.

     So for me my answer are A and B content, i would like to see both content on KTO page and the combination of two it would be great. Because they are same important and informative. 

     Thank you...$$B) information abt budget tips at korea etc food,accomodation, transport..tips for those like to stay longer at korea like work or study and more info abt halal food..$$For me the two categories A and B are important because the information be explained strengthen it when the image or video
Where the image or video simplifies and explains the information-oriented reader also helps is weak in the language of the arrival of the information picture him speak in turn. Also, image or video will be more pronounced if the crisis has strengthened the information
For example, when we talk about halal food safety we have to mention that these foods are sold and be nice when we put some pictures of halal food, and how progress will be delicious and also the tourist will go to him easily.
Since it is a page-oriented tourists must be guide with pictures and information that make it easier for tourists to visit the site, which is the image.$$B. I would like to see more of the information-oriented content.$$Dear Korea Tourism Organisation India Would Like to hear B) information abt tips at korea etc Transportation , food ( Resturants ,Cafe ) ,Attractions , Accomodation tips$$Dear   Korea Tourism Organisation India    Would Like to hear B) information abt tips at korea etc Transportation , food ( Resturants ,Cafe ) ,Attractions , Accomodation tips$$B) information on where to find elevators on the subway, stations and which exits.$$b) It would be nice to get to know more about Korean food and foreign food in korea.

I would like to see more information about low-key places (i.e. restaurants, cafes, events, etc).

When KTO give information bout Korean food we would like to know about where it sales too and how to got there. Because I think every aspects are realated. So, it will be very great to have KTO give both of options.

Hongmen reservoir, built in 1958, is located on the ruins of the ancient Xiaoshi Township, which was an important trade center and hub for water transportation between Jiangxi and Fujian provinces.

The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Surigao (one hour), then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a bus from Manila or Davao to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

居住在石屎森林內的香港人很少 甚至從來沒到過香港郊野 不知道香港原來有星空 山野 等自然境色 

自從2014年第一次登山 我就迷上了香港自然及城市的景色 一有時間便會到郊外地區拍攝風景相片 後來發覺背著沉重的器材登上每一個山頭都花了不小的氣力及時間 也有很多時候會空手而回 

另外 拍攝美麗的景色需要半夜凌晨開始登山 到達山頂後自己卻選擇在景色最美的時刻忙著拍攝 我覺得有點兒浪費 我再問問自己 為何不先讓自己的眼睛欣賞 而選擇讓 “相機食先” ? 

後來我改為拍攝Timelapse 在美景出現前把相機設定為定時拍攝 然後讓自己安靜坐下享受著自然的美景 一來可以制作成影片給自己用作回顧之用 二來可以分享給埋沒在工作的香港人 能讓他們在濃縮的短片內有如身臨其境的感受 令他們知道香港不只剩下石屎森林

It is surrounded by a number of smaller islands locally called Gili, e.g.  Gili Trawangan, Gili Air, and Gili Mano which offering more beaches, reefs for diving and snorkeling, as well as a sea turtle hatchery. 

The island’s topography is dominated by the centrally—located stratovolcano Mount Rinjani, the second highest volcano in Indonesia which rises to 3,726 m (12,224 ft). The volcano and its crater lake, “Segara Anak” (Child of the Sea), are protected by the Gunung Rinjani National Park which established in 1997. 

It shows that Lombok has no shortage of attractions both in and out of the water. No wonder that Lombok become most popular destination in West Nusa Tenggara, recently.

Carrying around 2,500 tourists from the US, EU, and Australia, the visitors have toured parts of Manila and Tagaytay. More cruise calls are expected in the Philippines this year, as part of the DOT's initiatives to push cruise tourism in the country.""","Philippines is a perfect place for cruise tourism  !$$I hope nothing happens to any of our guests..i always hear praises from tourists how helpful and friendly Filipinos are! There's no denying that Philippines has now become a destination of choice for many foreign tourists for good reasons.$$I love the philippines so mutch with the great nature and the smiling people and i never understand wy you not have more tourismus . ITS a great country .$$Our government should invest on a port facility exclusively for cruise ships making port calls in our country. It need not be in Manila itself given the crowded, smelly, dirty, petty crime-infested port area that we have for many decades now.  Singapore has just built its own while other neighboring countries are expected to pursue the same path and capture the highly lucrative cruise ship tourism. It seems that I don't hear any plans whatsoever by our government to build a modern, state of the art and technology cruise ship terminal in our country in the coming years.  Maybe they're very busy lining up their pockets, wallets, bank accounts and cash vaults with moolah from PDAF and DAP? Sad indeed.$$I never felt safe in the Philippines every time I come to visit our country,  most specialy in Manila.$$Give a warm welcome to the different foreign nationality as our guest in our country,we have to show them and prove to them that the Philippines are safe haven for the tourists like them.Let them fell our Logo,It's more fun in the Philippines.$$Phillippines a beautiful viewing here in our country that a tourist visit us and enjoyed all the historical view want to see them...so take care all the tourist who wants to visit inthe PHILIPPINES....$$wow! i wish i was there. that must be very exciting! we are to be proud again! and its a good signs for our country on tourism and for all the world to see what's the philippines beauty!.$$Been in Sydney Harbor when Queen Elizabeth Cruise was there end of february..this is great!that the Department of Tourism here in Ph welcoming this big tourist in our country as a lot of nice places to see here..$$Is it really a maiden call ?

Angono, Rizal

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Rizal from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
Water is so central to Angono life that during the town's yearly festival, fishermen hang their catch near the image of the town's patron saint. Of course, St. Clement is also the patron saint of fishermen. Afterwards, the image, the fish and the fishermen get on a large boat and parade down the Angono River.

Fun Fact:
Angono is also known for its higantes — colorful oversized paper-mache effigies.

Will it work? Time will tell.$$More to come...6.9m then 10m...$$The real problem is that the older main MRT lines have not been created with redundant tracks. Meaning you cannot fix any line without shutting down the line. 

This is why the MRT is not open 24/7. 6 hours in the early morning is devoted to maintenance. This is also why the newer lines have a third track. 

But for the original red and green lines, any kind of long term shut down is unthinkable because so much of our transport now revolves around the MRT. And yet any strategic overhaul of a rail system of our size requires at least 6 months. And the infrastructure is getting older and older.

http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/195240/8-philippine-destinations-every-pinoy-should-visit-in-his-lifetime ","Guidelines and businesses Republic of the Philippines.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I present to you a few suggestions to eliminate the negative impact of warming and a significant increase in tourist business. You miscalculated them, and if the proposal will be acceptable to dock and start working.
First.
If the work will begin immediately in January 2016, by the beginning of tourist season, I'd have to produce fresh water:
First. This innovation will make it possible in the spring of 2016 tourists drink crystal clear water pristine purity.
Second.
Use this water for watering can summer 2016 travelers will feed organic products straight from the beds, and it will provide an increase of tourists to 10-15% per year. Plus, the constant increase - parents with children with physical or mental defects. In subsequent years, innovation will be piloted by the tourists, and increase the flow of tourists will grow.
In the Philippines, it is also restored all the rivers, and land, and underground reservoirs on a level and clean. This will increase productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, the growth of agricultural and meat dairy products), and tracts of forest.
Third.
The large influx of tourists will force the government of the Philippines to increase the construction business for themselves and for sale. This will lead to an increase in employment in the construction business and dozens of related companies
Finally, and most importantly, what needs to be done immediately.
Philippines - a country many mountain formations. Mountain formation and neighboring lithospheric tectonic plates and many thousands were in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. That is what happened in the Indonesian nightmare when the tsunami killed 250,000 people. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And such or similar joints in the Philippines and around - many dozens. Programs of all types of cooling plates and joints are.
For 10 years, the ecology of the Philippines will be restored to the level of 1980. There basting to reduce damage from hurricanes over the current theme, but it is not yet finalized.

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

#bestyeyeintheworldI am still recovering from a massive sobbing fit as I type this, so do pardon me if there are any typos or grammatical errors. This year, my family's CNY reunion dinner went completely beyond my expectaitions.

Last August I came out to Mum and Dad, and was promptly kicked out. I had prepared for the worst, though, and moved in with a friend. So all went well, more or less, except for me being somewhat depressed and withdrawn. I was not expecting to be called back for the reunion this year.

Enter my maternal grandfather, Ye Ye, a.k.a. The Colonel. He retired from the Malaysian army as a colonel, and is still much respected in the family. The fact that he takes no crap from anyone probably helped that. I was about to go for a drink (alone) for my CNY eve, when he called me. What follows is a rough outline of what he said:

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

Ye Ye himself was at the dinner table, and stood up when he saw me. What he said right then still rings in my ears.

""This is XXXX. My grandson. Some of you think he is not fit to be part of this family home simply because he is attracted to men instead of women. Shame on you! If he leaves, I will too, and FUCK anyone who dares to tell me otherwise!""

The whole house went quiet, and Ye Ye told me to come over and have some food. I was in tears by then, and he told me not to cry, and that he was sorry for not doing anything earlier (according to him no one told him anything until the afternoon, whe=n he noticed me missing from my usual spot chopping vegetables). Dinner was a silent affair, but he did ask me a lot of questions about how I'd been, whether I was happy, so on.

After dinner, I went to see him in his room, and cried. I knelt down and asked for forgiveness for not continuing his family line and for having brought any shame to him. But this man, my grandfather, a military veteran, just told me that it was fine, and that I had done no wrong. That I had been enough of a man to speak the truth, and that by doing so, he was more proud of me than if I had chosen to live a double life. He did admit to some disappointment that he wouldn't get any great grandchildren from me, but in his words, 'some things in life are not meant to be'.

God bless you Ye Ye.

What is it?
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact:
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University’s Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Yours Cordially

Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and Sicogon Development Corporation (SIDECO) will launch Sicogon Island Tourism Estate development within the first half of 2016.

The ALI-SIDECO joint venture is expected to drive economic progress in Western Visayas and the entire region as it serves as a tourism hub for surrounding or nearby destinations like Gigantes, Bantayan and Concepcion islands.

The 1,100-hectare Sicogon Island will feature a balanced mix of developments, such as a resort town center, hotels and resorts, as well as commercial and residential establishments, supported by an on-site airstrip.  The ground breaking of the airport runway is scheduled for the second half of the year.

“The initial development will concentrate on building the airport and runway, to ensure accessibility to the island,” said Jose Emmanuel Jalandoni, ALI Senior vice president and group head of commercial business.  “The 1.3-kilometer runway will allow immediate access from Manila and Cebu to the island development,” he added, saying further that test flights to Sicogon are being targeted for the first quarter of 2017.

The project is supported by public, private and community organizations, and government bodies alike because of the potential economic benefits it will bring to the region.  A framework agreement was signed by ALI, SIDECO, and the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk Association (FESIFFA) in 2014 to pave the way for the sustainable development of Sicogon Island.  The group has been assisting the local community through skills training and livelihood programs to make them active partners in the development.

“We strongly believe and hope that poverty alleviation will be achieved through tourism projects.  These will give us various job opportunities and help us improve farming and fishing methods,” said Raul Ramos, president of FESIFFA.

Jalandoni stressed that sustainability will be a main focus of the project.  Aside from allocating more than 50% of the development for open green space, ALI will also work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to continue stewardship of Sicogon’s forested area, and work on coastal protection and marine life rehabilitation in support of sustainable development.

“More than becoming a premier tourist destination and a tourism hub for the region, Sicogon is envisioned to provide inclusive growth and economic development through long-term recovery and livelihood programs, and job creation,” said Jalandoni.

ALI estimates that the Sicogon Island development will provide 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly with increased tourism, and approximately P1 billion in earnings for the community through business opportunities that will come from the retail and commercial establishments.

It's the welcome, the smiles, the sounds of karaoke sings out through the provinces as a celebration is celebrating with smiles, song and laughter. Oh the foods many great traditional foods.
The Philippines is the place of the SMILE, A place where you can find peace by opening your eyes and ears and just take in the beauty it has to offer. THE BEAUTY IS THE PEOPLE. No matter in their everyday struggle to purely and unselfishly work hard to simply be a provider for thier families. They still manage to smile, sing and dance. A simple but determined culture teaching other cultures the true humble spirit of a country that can not have much compared to most visitors but can still maintain a place of beauty serinity and peace..

Here's another shot of Sevilla's bamboo hanging bridge, serene in the morning hours as a local paddles onward. When traveling, I often get asked why I wake up before the sun, even as someone who isn't exactly a morning person. In addition to the common reason being staggering, natural light for film and photography, it's the rare window to behold a place's true character. This dawn was no exception, as I observed residents go about the beginning of their day undisturbed. Absorbing the culture in this way is what makes it all the more meaningful. Simply put, think twice before you hit that snooze button.

Namahage is the name of the strange deity resembling a demon, known as oni. The young men as Namahage show up wearing large orge masks and straw capes. As the main event, you could see Namahage dance and drum performance in front of bonfire!The sticky rice cakes passed out by Namahage are said to keep off disaster. The Namahage event is derived from the belief that a deity bringing good fortune makes a visit to the village from elsewhere in the New Year.

Thanks for your feedback. These people are representatives from various National Tourism Organizations worldwide, not travel agents.  The program is focused on international exchange and learning from eachother.  

Putting ads in travel magazines is definitely an important part of marketing strategy.  Our company is quite large, and we are mostly focused on online marketing, so I will have to ask around to see what kind of ad campaigns they have in the USA.  What kind of specific aspects of Korea would you like to see featured in such ads?$$I haven't seen a single ad for Korea in any of the travel magazines I've read. As for what kind of ads would appeal to American audiences, different ads focusing on Korea's natural beauty, like its hiking trails and temples (templestay). 
I also think BYJ did a good job with the different tour maps in the back of his book. If he keeps those maps in his English version, that'd be an awesome selling point, too. $$KTO, doing something about Jeju is a most. Is KTO targeting budget travelers who look to spend as little as possible? Or are you targeting women who want to shop? Now that Hawaiian Airlines (very soon) will have direct flights into Korea, you may want to think about what kind of visitor you want?  $$Is there an email address to comment off the wall?  BTW Love yr Facebook Wall. Look fwd to it everyday with new discoveries!$$oooooooo!!!, I would like to travel and discover how interesting it is a culture, in this case South Korea!$$Hi Everyone, thanks for your lovely comments and suggestions.  I will pass them along to the marketing team.

Today we introduce Yabusame Shinto Ritual events which will be held at Shimogamo Shrine on May 3rd in Kyoto. Yabusame is a traditional art of horseback archery which used to be for centuries an important part of Samurai discipline. The event is starting from 1:00p.m., but here is a secret tip that you can enjoy Yabusame!
Try getting up early to visit morning practice in the shrine. You can take your time among so few spectators and closely watch archers harmonizing themselves with horses, their skill with their spirit in the crisp morning air. They will take you back a millennium to the age of the Samurai.
If you missed this time, don’t worry! The rituals of Yabusame are took place in spring and autumn festivals at famous shrines.

Cold showers were at first a rude awakening, my wife's house, no hot water or A/C (we married last year, I stayed instead of us moving to my country, she is self employed). The Provinces are beautiful. Still not used to the pail and bucket, T.P. is in the house :P. I am thanked when providing exact change.  People are friendly, but one must keep in mind in an area like Metro Manila, it also has elements all large Metro areas have, a criminal element and some pick out foreigners, reality, must be self aware. And will get stared at by a few lol. Security is everywhere, the malls, businesses. I like it. I give Philippines 5 stars.$$As peace corps volunteers in Leyte, we always filled the bucket up hours before our  'showers'  so that the water had a chance to warm up.  But sometimes it was so hot and humid that the cold water coming straight from the pipe sticking out of the wall felt great!$$it's really nice to read nice comments from foreign friends who have visited and is currently staying in our country, Philippines is totally far from other superpower countries where almost everything is advanced in technology, clean and so on... Philippines is still one of the 3rd world countries, poverty is still every where, living in the province is definitely something to try, though you really have to leave most of the luxury and convenience technology can give in place of fresh air, beautiful scenery, simple living, great people, and everything is cheap compared to city life in the metro!$$Another thing is some people do charge you more for some stuffs thinking that you are a foreigner but then change the rates when you speak Tagalog fluently. Other than that cool and friendly people.$$Philippines is a lovely country & nice place to live in ( much nicer if you have a bit of money - thats the reality about it )...I lived abroad for quite sometime now, but, I always think & longing to go home as much as possible in the Philippines ( as always they say...there's no place like home where most of your family, relatives & friends are)...I'm going home in a month time to the Phils. for just a Holiday/break...I can't wait.$$I don't care about the brown-outs, cold bucket showers, unreliable wi-fi....it's part of Filipino culture....bahala na.

What is it? 
Schooling is when a group of fish swim together in one direction. They do this to fend off predators by creating a “confusion effect,” where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

Fun Fact: 
Shoaling is different from schooling. Shoaling is when a species of fish are grouped close together, but are swimming independently. Tubbataha has 600 species of fish that either school or shoal.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/photogenic-mrtOpen your eyes, on your daily commute and you’ll realise our train stations can be pretty cool. Instagram-worthy, even. Check out these 10 stations the next time you take the train!","I especially love Bras Basah MRT Station's glass ceilings. Every time I happen to be there, I always get tricked by the ceilings thinking that it is raining outside.$$I love Choa Chu Kang MRT the most, it's the station that I alight home and also the station that I leave home. Each time people talk about Choa Chu Kang MRT, it makes me feel proud of where I am staying at. Also, each time after returning from camps or overseas and when I alight at Choa Chu Kang MRT, it makes me feel home again. Furthermore, that is also the place where I meet my long-ago friends that I made during my primary and secondary school days, it's like a hot spot that I alight saying ""hi"" and ""bye"" but still feel that ""I'll see you again"".$$Dhoby Ghaut gets my vote due to the beautiful coloured tiles and the amazing 3D effect! Can't wait to refresh my wardrobe with this win!$$I think I will choose Rochor MRT Station. The design of black & white (a never out-dated colours)stripes look cool and unique like filming of the movies star wars.$$Liked and shared! 
My favourite would be Stadium MRT. It is a cool, unique, well designed stadium with splendid scenery around it. It really stands out even when there is no crowds.$$I ❤️ Stadium MRT because the architect cleverly makes use of natural light to effectively illuminate the station, providing cost effective way to light up the station. 
I also like the slight darker theme which is stark contrast against the ceiling and the tiling... I think it's minimalistic yet elegant 😊
Liked and shared 👍$$it's gotta be bukit panjang LRT for me. not only does it make awesome West makan places such as Al Azhar's so much more accessible, the long panels inside the station itself are a piece of art to look at!$$It's such a hard choice to pick a fav !! I rlly like the unique Kallang wave designs on the floors of stadium !! Rlly brings me the feels of feeling cool and shiok when I take Mrt there for concerts and shoppings!! The view outside the stadium mrt is great too since there is a splendid view of the waters and landscape of Singapore 😘😍🎡⚓️🌊$$I like Rochor MRT station. Simple, sleek and elegant and a an evergreen feeling just like G2000! Hope to win the vouchers and get myself some G2k clothings! Thank you!

My favourite would be the Stadium MRT. It's full of photos of sports images on the walls And I love the huge station, it looks like I'm inside a ship! The contrast lightings, the sleek grey design is very modern. I often go there to Sports Hub library, and I buy my sports apparel there.

I love G2000 because of the classy, clean and trendy design of the clothes. I love being chic and trendy.$$My favourite is the Stadium! The Jewel tone blue makes me feel at ease and happy! The sleek grey wall outside just nice for people who loves to take selfie or wefie! Cause the plain sleek grey design won snatched away ur presence instead it turns out to be a very nice background ☺
I love to go G2000 to shop for my bf office wear. It always have nice shirt and pants and it makes my by look smart in them! 
Liked and shared ☺$$My favourite mrt station has got to be Stadium! The cutting edge design esp the colourful 'runway' makes it look like you are overseas! Very proud of the team who is behind this ; from idea generation to realising it. Thanks for making Singapore a much beautiful place. :)
Liked this post and definitely worth a share in promoting tourism!$$Liked and shared! 

My favourite would be the Stadium MRT. It's full of energy with sporting images at the entrances/exit of the MRT! And I love the colours of the flooring! Furthermore, it's the MRT station I am at everyday! 

On the website, it states to say why you should pick me, and my answer is just simple because I need a wardrobe upgrade for work!$$I like the Dhoby Ghaut series with the pretty glass patterned window panels! It just makes every outfit look awesome with the natural lighting!

And of course the super long escalator (such that it can feel like an amusement roller coaster ride for the faint hearted! * grab the railings! Don't turn back! * )$$I love Redhill station the most, it is not a new station and its design is not as nice as the rest of the mrt stations but it brought back many childhood memories as I used to stay there with my dearest grandfather! He is not around anymore but whenever I pass by this station, it will remind me of the fond memories I had with him!

Thanks thesmartlocal and G2000 for this  giveaway!$$Bras basah mrt has got to be the favorite for me with its unique and mesmerizing architectural design. Plus the super high see through ceiling that gives the natural lighting and zen colour codes of the mrt walls makes it ideal for having ootd in G2000 winter wear!$$Liked and shared! 
I love the stadium shot, as the grey walls gives the calm feel, and the blue waves in the station gives the futuristic feel. 
I would often hang around kallang wave, and this is also the reason why i love stadium mrt!!:)$$My favorite among all the photogenic mrt stations will be 🚇 Dhoby Ghaut Station!

Born a west-sider, I've always like to make extra effort to doll myself up going the distance away especially town areas. Apart from that, the station is underground and air-conditioned, which would allow me to dress in any type of outfit and no sweat! 💦 G2000 have wide range of really nice and comfortable formal outfits best suited for working class (like ME!) and I love taking varieties of OOTDs anywhere that I can find in public. Now IT's Time For MRT... Doors closing, dududududu.....$$Liked and shared! My favourite mrt station would be Rochor because simplicity is key! White and black colour scheme never grow old and it looks so unique and stand out most among all the mrt station in Singapore! Furthermore its on downtown line which is my favourite line and I am quite sure alot Westies rely heavily after its launch last year!$$Love all the pics esp for Dhoby Ghaut station! Liked n shared! 

My answer for why should you pick me... I need more work clothes! & I love the clothes @ G2000! Hope to win! ☺️$$i liked Redhill mrt based photos. its red in color. its got ""age"" in the photo. Bring back fond memories with the payphone booth. At the wall base, you can see some aging and some wear and tear. I reflects that we need to look after our past to look into the future!$$Liked the 2 FB. Liked and shared the post. I didn't know that there are ""primary colour stations "" along the East-West line. I will go explore the west -- just make pit stops at these stations to take pictures with one MRT ticket - station after station!  Different colour, even simple plain colour could just set the different mood and feel - so this is my Favourite of the lots, esp the cheerful yellow at Commonwealth station.  
💛❤️💙💚$$6. Commonwealth.

I grew up there, its a station that holds so many memories! From going to malls, schools and even town, its so accessible and convenient! The colours still remain which brings out the many years of untouched history unlike new stations that are too colourful. 🍀$$My favourite is Stadium MRT Station. The station interiors are lit up by natural light from a large opening in the roof. Aluminium cladding adds luminosity for a “soft-touch” look. Stadium MRT Station really stands out among other train stations with its good design and innovation.

The ancient Mahayana Buddhist monument and UNESCO World Heritage Site of Borobudur in Central Java, Indonesia, which contains 72 stupas and 1,460 relief panels, is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, made in the early 9th century. It is unique since the intricately carved panels that weave their way through the different levels of the temple depict so many stories from the Buddha's life as shown in the Lalitavistara Sutra, as well as narratives from the Gandavyuha Sutra, the Jatakas, etc. It was said to have been inspired by the original Dhanyakataka Stupa in South India, commissioned by a king of the Buddhist Sailendra dynasty who was strongly influenced by the braoder Srivijaya empire of that time, and Jowo Atisha's Sumatran teacher Dharmakirtishri was from that Srivijaya family. Atisha spent twelve years in Indonesia to learn the meditations for developing bodhicitta and the Tara practices, so this is a very important pilgrimage area for Tibetan Buddhists as the source for many of the practices that Atisha brought to Tibet is here. There are also commentaries by Indonesian masters in the Tengyur. Atisha visited the holy temples in Java and one of his other teachers, Acharya Pindo, was also from Java. In modern times, many of the great Tibetan Buddhist masters, like HH the Dalai Lama, HH the Sakya Trizin, HE Luding Khenchen Rinpoche, et. have made pilgrimages to Borobudur, and all this inspired me to pay a short pilgrimage at the beginning of 2016. I felt deeply inspired by this beautiful and blessed place, and I think that anyone interested in bodhicitta should try to visit Borobudur too if they can. Not only can we learn a lot from it, but just to meditate here for a short time can instantly arouse strong compassion, samadhi and blessings.
-Avikrita Vajra Rinpoche

“Being near Borobudur one is immersed in the great blessings of all the masters who have practised here before. Anyone who visits this holy place will make a positive advancement in their aspirations to achieve an awakened mind.”

Fly from Manila to Cagayan de Oro.

Or take a boat from Manila, Iloilo, or Cebu to Cagayan de Oro.

What is it?
Whitewater rafting in the Philippines started in Cagayan de Oro City, the country's ""Adventure Capital,"" in 1995. It was just a hobby for Rupert Domingo and Julius Bioco, but it flourished into a thrilling endeavor – not just for themselves, but for other adventure-seekers as well. The two spent a decade surveying and crossing the river, painstakingly mastering its shape and channels. Now, tourists rely on their group's rafting expertise for an unforgettable adventure along the Cagayan River.

Fun Fact:
The 23 rapids of Cagayan River have names. Some are funny, and some are intimidating – Elephant, Letter L, Letter S, Cloud 10, I'm Busy, Twister, 360, Surprise, Kiss The Wall, Braves Way, Rodeo, etc.

I would love to spend this LOVELY 2 nights stay at Lost World Hotel Sunway City Ipoh with my LOVELY wife 💑

To my wife -

To some people February 14th is just another day.
For me this is a day to take time and say "" I love you""
Stop, and think what we've been through and how much love has outgrown us ❤

Everyday I see your beautiful, smiling face,
And there are moments that I stare and you took my breath away, 
and left me with nothing to say ❤

On this special day,
I ask myself how it is possible to love a person so much.
My heart has been permanently touched ❤

Once there was a deep dark hole nobody could touch,
Until you came and filled it with all your love.
On this special day I want you to know,
I love you,
More than I could write down, tell, explain or even try to show ❤

Not proud, but I barely passed basic Chinese at O levels and even once scored zero on an exam (lol). So embarrassing but it has much to do with the fact that my entire family isn't very good with mandarin. Including my grandparents who were English educated back then hahahaha

So I thought this can be the good opportunity to sharpen my mandarin:) and I love to travel! I think Fauzi knows that 😜$$Liked and shared! 

I've been living in Singapore on and off for about 9 years, without knowing any or very little mandarin - but I know the important stuff like saying yes when the Uncle asks if I want Chilli in my wanton Mee 🌝. What's worse is that I always get mistaken to be Chinese and older generations have even scolded me for my lack of linguistic abilities. 😔

I'd love for the opportunity to explore China with my Boyfriend Lam Weng Pui who is also as bad in the language front having done CLB in O levels and spending very little time in Singapore.$$#mychinesedamnbad
I'm Eurasian, my husband Isaac Abraham is Indian. We both can't speak anything besides English. And our 4.5yr old has been tasked to study Mandarin in school.

Coimbatore, an ancient city, was the capital of a small tribal village, Kongunad, before the 2nd century AD until it was brought under Chola control in the 2nd-3rd centuries AD by Karikalan, the first of the early Cholas. 

Among its other great rulers were the Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas, Pandyas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara kings. When Kongunad fell to the British along with the rest of the state, its name was changed to Coimbatore. 

Today, Coimbatore (Kovai in Tamil) is a commercial city of considerable importance; it is home to over 60 spinning and weaving mills and textiles is its main industry. It is also well known for motor sports with regular events being held at the Kari Motor Speedway.

Kanchipuram, the golden city of a thousand temples, was once the capital of the Pallava dynasty. It is considered one of the seven sacred cities of India; some of the best temples were built here during the reign of the Pallavas between the 6th and 7th centuries. Subsequently, Kanchipuram also served as an important city of the far-flung empires of the Chola and the Vijayanagara dynasties.

Later, these dynasties too contributed greatly in the temple building activity of this town. 
The city has also been, through the years, a great seat of learning and culture. Adi Sankaracharya established his episcopal seat (Kamakodipeedam) here. Sri Sankaracharya, Appar, Siruthonder and the great Buddhist Bikshu, Bodhidharma, once lived and worked here. Today, it is known not only for temples but also for its hand-woven, silk fabrics.

Yours sincerely,
Monika Ederer-Mosing$$Your city has a sister city relationship with Seoul, the capital of South Korea. But I question whether the majority of citizens here would be comfortable with the relationship if they knew of the horrors inflicted on hundreds of thousands of dogs in South Korea on barbaric ‘meat dog’ farms.

In South Korea, thousands of dogs are kept crammed in filthy metal cages. They’re fed on the carcasses of other dead dogs, and they’re deeply distressed from a combination of boredom and terror.

Almost every video I saw about the Philippines was about the islands. That's too shallow and easy. So I wanted to visit this country to make the best video on this country, and I think this is it.

To show you how generous people are, I lived on $0.00 for a day.
To show you how cheap the place can be, we threw a party for an entire village.
To shed more light on poverty, we bought a 1,000 burgers to feed people.

An Appeal to the United Nations from a former Filipino Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly

I am Michael Francis Acebedo Lopez, a Filipino and a former delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. Nearly ten years before the questionable rise of one Leni Robredo to the Philippine Vice Presidency, I had the honor of representing my country, the Philippines, as the youngest Filipino delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in its history. I also had the opportunity to be the Philippines’s first actual Youth Representative or Delegate, a partial fulfillment of our commitment to the UN’s World Programme of Action for Youth or WPAY. 

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accepted my letter of credential signed by the Philippine Foreign Minister. There it was stated that I was attending the General Assembly “as Adviser to the Third Committee Plenary Session on Social Development, including questions relating to the World Social Situation and to Youth, Ageing, Disabled Persons and the Family.” In the august halls of the UN World Headquarters in New York, I also had the honor to draft and deliver the Philippine Statement to the General Assembly’s Third Committee. 

In light of Vice President Robredo’s video message to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs posted on TIME Magazine’s website and shared by various media organizations, I am recalling the mandate I was once given in an effort to reach out to all of you, member states of the UN and all organizations within the UN System. If said mandate is not sufficient because it has long since lapsed, I am hinging my appeal therefore on my being a natural born citizen of one of only four Asian nations who signed the 1945 Charter that created the United Nations. 

I am making this urgent appeal on behalf of each and every Filipino grossly misrepresented by our a Vice President in said video message, a Vice President whose own mandate has been called into question, with the highest electoral tribunal of the land, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, having considered the election protest against her win to be sufficient in both form and substance. 

With unfounded claims and unsubstantiated allegations, Vice President Robredo wantonly painted an impossibly grim image of the Philippine situation if only to attract international attention and action. To say that she delved in speculation is understating the gravity of her made-up claims and the severity of the damage she has caused on our country and our people in so doing. In reporting to the world what she failed to report to Philippine authorities, assuming there are actual reports received by the Office of the Vice President, she has not only embarrassed our country, she has betrayed the public trust and committed economic sabotage, both punishable under Philippine laws. 

For her to say that “our people feel both hopeless and helpless” is a brazen lie. Confidence in the presidency is at an all time high (while the same cannot be said of the vice president whose approval ratings continue to plummet); as a people, we feel hopeful and empowered like we’ve never felt before. 

Please understand that at the heart of this is destructive party politics. It is the Vice President’s party flexing its muscles to overthrow a duly elected government so they may once more regain control of government. Perhaps she feels time is running out for her because of developments in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal. So she and her allies have launched an expensive campaign using human rights and the War on Drugs as their excuse to bait the world into interfering in our domestic issues. 

When the Vice President says 7,000 people have been killed in the President’s War on Drugs, she fails to mention that this is set against the backdrop of around 700,000 to one million successful arrests and surrenders. So the figure she presents to you is not even one percent. And surely with the sheer number of those involved in the illicit drug trade, some police operations see suspects resisting arrest and fighting back and the police having to defend themselves resulting in casualties. Every war has casualties. It is not a perfect war and I’m certain there have been abuses along the way, and these need to be looked into and those responsible must be brought to justice. But exaggerating things does not help at all. 

In asking for the international community, the UN, to intervene, she uses the issue of human rights. Let us then talk about human rights. 

In responding to the call of Robredo, the international community must tread carefully lest it encroaches on our very sovereignty and our right to self-determination. And as a sovereign state, we have determined to wage an internal war (not a war against another nation) against the evils of drugs, a direction affirmed by our democratic processes when President Duterte who included the War on Drugs as one of his main programs of action, received an overwhelming mandate during the May 2016 Presidential Election. In short, the War on Drugs, by extension, has the people’s mandate. 

Any effort to disturb our democracy and sovereignty as a response to the Vice President’s irresponsible and unfounded claims will subvert the will of the Filipino people and violate our Human Right of Suffrage enshrined in both the Philippine Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 21 of the international covenant). 

Once again, I am making this appeal to all member states of the United Nations and all organizations within the UN System to disregard the Philippine Vice President’s statement which is, I reiterate, a grave misrepresentation of the prevailing sentiments of our people and a gross perversion of the facts surrounding the War on Drugs. 

To my fellow Filipinos, let us remain vigilant in the face of threats to our democracy by the very people who claim to defend it. Ako po’y nanawagan na i-share ang video na ito upang ito ay umabot sa UN at sa iba’t ibang foreign governments. 

Maraming salamat. Thank you and good evening.

Photos courtesy of Seoul Metropolitan Government. ","To South Korea Government Official You Hyun Sik, Kim Su-Jeong & Korea Tourism Board,

You have been quoted in numerous news report claiming that foreigners ripped off by taxi drivers can claim a reward as compensation from the Seoul city government for helping to curb the rampant scams. This email serves to determine whether you are aware that your team is not carrying that out in reality, or if you know that but are simply making empty promises to the media.

I visited Seoul in September last year and unfortunately became a victim of 2 taxi scams. The first taxi driver tampered with the meter to charge me an extra 28,000 KRW. The second taxi driver appeared drunk, stopped multiple times to leave the meter running for extra money while grumbling to himself. When questioned, he turned violent to shout and swing his forearm towards me narrowly missing my forehead.

Trip details and receipts were reported to Seoul Authorities, Mr. Seongmin Lee and Mr. Jongjoong Kim. Thanks to their investigation, the errant taxi drivers were caught, with fines and warnings imposed. Your government officials also asked for my details and shared these with the driver when he promised to bank transfer the extra amount.

This turned out to be a lie - I was subsequently told that the driver only made the promise hoping the police will let him off, and now that he doesn't keep his promise, you government officials cannot do anything about it anyway!? My case was subsequently escalated to your rewards team for the compensation you publicly claimed to protect tourists from what I underwent.

After more than half a year (Sep15 - Present) of sending multiple email & email reminders, making many international phone calls to your office when nobody bothers to reply, I was told that my case is rejected.

The excuse your team gave: The Seoul team said that the taxi driver is from Incheon; the Incheon team said their compensation period started after my incident happened. Both sides refused to compensate. There was no mention on the second driver even though he is from Seoul, no compensation was given either.

Seongmin and Jongjoong helped to scrutinise the Seoul team reward legislations. They confirmed that there is ""no stated restriction for taxis from other municipal areas"", so by right my case perfectly qualifies. Nevertheless, there is little they can do if your rewards team unscrupulously insist on using that excuse which is clearly NOT in the legislation (nor in any of your news report) to avoid compensating tourists . Hence, my decision to take this directly to you and the South Korea Tourism Board.

It is bad enough that your taxis are out to scam tourists. Now even the Seoul government are trying to shirk responsibility, coming up with excuses using newly-imagined regulation to avoid compensating tourists & wasting 8 months of our time. With the authorities setting such a bad example in keeping promises, it is no wonder your taxi driver dares to promise compensation to the police then break his promise after that - He is just following in your footsteps!

Please take this as a public request for You Hyun Sik, Kim Su-Jeong & the tourism board to look into my case for compensation. Also take this as a public service announcement so that other tourists will not foolishly believe your word that the Seoul government authorities is actually protecting and compensating tourists ripped off by your taxi drivers.

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University’s Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Best Regards
Yours Cordially

Korean version can be found here → http://bit.ly/1kGEYjF ","That's a bummer for multicultural couples. :( I'd like to go with my husband (I'm American; he's Korean). He speaks English very well, but I guarantee I will not understand if I'm on the Korean tour. Looks beautiful though!$$Does this mean that ONLY foreigners can get tickets here? What if Koreans and foreigners want to travel here together?$$KTO, thank you for your work and all the information provided which makes it very easy to travel around.
As some people have said above the fact that there are some tours for ""only foreigners"" is not understood by many because many people would like to go with their Korean friends or significant other. I guess it is just made to give opportunities for tourists who come from abroad, but still I find it unfair that Koreans cannot attend the tours in Chinese, English or Japanese if they wish to while a foreigner who has lived in Korea for 20 years could go. So, maybe it would be better to say ""only for non-residents""? There could be also the case of foreigners with Korean nationality.... what should they do? For all these reasons I would rather prefer to see ""Tours in Chinese, English and Japanese language"" better than ""foreigners"" being the case that KTO is mainly targeted to potential visitors to Korea which makes some 6.9 billion foreigners around the world and leave the word ""foreigner"" a bit meaningless. Also not all foreigners speak those languages, so my parents, for example, speak only Spanish and if they come to Korea they don't mind joining any of the 4 tours be it in Korean or English because they don't understand anything :)
I find it very useful and hospitable that you offer services in foreign languages, but from my point of view having queues to buy tickets only for foreigners (as in Yongin Folk Village) or entrance for foreigners (in Busan fireworks festival) is a little bit bizarre and kind of unfair for Koreans... I haven't seen anything similar in any other country. It's good that you make an effort but let tourists just live the experience as comfortably or uncomfortably as Koreans~

_______

Three months after kicking off 2016 with a social media contest, the Department of Tourism (DOT) announced on Friday, 19 February 2016, the three winners of the photo-fail challenge, each bagging a trip for two back to the Philippines. The contest encouraged foreign visitors to post their best photo-fails taken in the islands, highlighting their fun and candid experiences in the country.

Bannered under the theme ""Visit the Philippines Again 2016,"" this year's tourism campaign aims to attract repeat visitors and new travelers alike to come visit the country and relive the fun experiences they had with their friends, loved ones, and even strangers-turned-friends.

Photo-fail images submitted by Jarne Uytersprot from Belgium, Chintai Kato from Japan, and Kaisa Kapanen from Finland were chosen among thousands who submitted their photos. These photo-fails highlighted off-guard moments of tourists while having fun in the Philippines.

Launched at the World Travel Mart in London, England last November, the social media contest invited foreign passport holders who have been to the Philippines to upload their own photo-fail versions on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook with the official hashtag #visitphilippinesagain2016. Winners of the contest will get a chance to re-do their photos taken in some of the top vacation destinations in the country.

""This social media campaign was our way to heighten up the excitement for big events lined up for the Philippines this year. 2016 is the year of 'again' and 'Visit the Philippines Again' will once more highlight the country as a multi-level experience destination filled with exciting activities and endless new discoveries, shared with their warm and fun-loving hosts, the Filipino people,"" says Tourism Secretary Ramon R. Jimenez, Jr.

Among the big events lined up this year are the Routes Asia 2016, Madrid Fusion Manila 2016, Flavors of the Philippines, Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2016, 2016 Ironman 70.3 Asia Pacific Championship, MTV Music Evolution 2016, the World Street Food Congress, and the Travel Blog Exchange (TBEX). The recent months also witnessed the Philippines' hosting of the ASEAN Tourism Forum in Manila and the World Eucharistic Congress in Cebu.

This relaxation escapade by Jojo Struys over a 2 day itinerary from 26 to 27 November 2016, certainly is a super relaxation staycation that I need to explore on the bustling central that I cannot imagine the hidden gem that allows me to be totally carefree. 
Having high rise buildings around had not deterred what I hope to get from the stay in The Westin. 
Having to face the lovely scene of Marina Bays while engaging in a yoga session at infinity pool simply is a real luxury that takes my breath away. 
Indulgence of the SuperFoodsRx is something that I hope to be able to eat healthily and heartier for my tummy. 
Enjoying the jacuzzi and steambath certainly leads me to an enchanted space out that I hope to enjoy. 
What's the best part a cozy snuggle on the 10 layers of comfortable SIMMONS bed is what I call maximum pampered. 
Breakfast at seasonal tastes is making me missing the comfort to patronise again for my next escapade.

Would love to spend time with my newly engaged fiancé Sherilyn Esther Tan in this awesome staycation. Haven't really had time to plan for the wedding since we got engaged a couple weeks back.

It would be a pleasure to stay in such cleverly strategically located hotel, surrounded by Singapore's beautiful landscape.$$Liked & Shared.
There are some people who couldn’t understand why others spend on local hotel stays instead of getting out of Singapore for a holiday and enjoy the fresher air somewhere else. For me, a Singapore staycation is a good recharge when I couldn’t afford to take leave to travel/didn’t feel up to it. Being in Singapore elsewhere other at home can sometimes be quite a therapy! I can be momentarily be relieved from all stress, work and at the same time “fantasize” about having my own house. After so many staycations, I believe that I can do a not-too-bad job of interior design for my own house in future! Thanks! 😄$$Liked & shared!
The Westin is the BEST place for a getaway! Bcos it is conveniently located in the heart of Singapore (you escape to where there is most blood supply yeah) and offers magnificent view! If you're in luck, u can even wave to the cruise ship (with a binoculars no less!)
This Relaxation Escape with Jojo Struys will be benefitting to us since our labour of love is hatched (not really in a shell but she did come out in her own water bag! En-caul birth! 1 in 80,000 births!)

Amazed with Owndays' simple price system and approach of owning a spec that matches one's lifestyle, fashion style and personality. Really like the posts on your FB! Been on a search for a pair as my present spec is few years old and couldn't seem to find one that fit my face size that I like. Hope I'll get to win this so that I can look great even as the bespectacled me! P.S.: saw a FB post about the lenses being able to block out the haze? That will be amazing for sensitive eyes.$$Early last year, I started experiencing severe vision blurring after I had stopped using contact lenses due to eye infections, which prevented me from reading books and computer fonts. My friend is an optometrist and she suggested that I let her take a look, turns out to be corneal staining. I had to refrain from contact lenses until it recovers but mine was a rare case and took almost a year to clear. 
I am so used to wearing spectacles now but the disadvantage is that my current pair does not go with all outfits, so I hope to win a pair of trendy glasses from Owndays to have more outfit choices (& maybe snap a hipster shot? ;)).$$What I really hate about wearing glasses is that some are just too heavy & uncomfortable that I often got headache after wearing it for whole day. Hope #Owndays  can help me find the PERFECT PAIR!$$I want to have a pair of spectacles which can highlight my eyes and bring out my personality. P.S. Is there a pair of glasses that can block out the haze? 
Instagram: macaron_macaroon$$I have been wearing this pair of glasses for 3 years and or so I take good care of it but regardless of how careful i am, glasses are bound to get damage by wear and tear overtime as currently i am serving NS and dropping of glasses are bound to happen :(

As you can see both the frames and lens are scratched and it really affects my vision especially at night which i have to deal with light glares and it makes me really uncomfortable!

i've heard of OWNDAYS long ago and been visiting different outlets whenever i chance upon to and i would say their designs i like would cost quite abit and for me as an NSF serving the 2 years in my country would already cost half of my 1 month's pay so i would really appreciate it if OWNDAYS is gives a pair of prescription glasses.

Indeed, learning to read and write hangeul maybe easier than understanding what they mean as a whole. However, it is still the process of learning that is fun and fruitful.  For VisitKorea fans who are learning the language, don't give up! 파이팅~! :D$$To read and write are easy since you just need to memorize it ~ that's why I can read and write hangeul, but to understand the meaning, it's another problem for me ㅎㅎㅎ I'm still working hard on it$$I learn it from watching some videos uplaoded in you tube. I can read little by little and kdrama also is a big help for me to understand some words and conversation. Happy hanguel day korea.$$I learned how to write and read Hangeul by using an App that I installed from the Google Play Store. At first I was very confused and had a difficult time in learning the vowels on how it sounds and how to pronounce it. And also I had a difficult time in remembering how the vowels and the consonants looks like because some are just the same like the B/P which looks like this, ㅂ . But still I did not gave up learning it. It was difficult at the same time it was fun. And it is also an advantage for me to read/write Hangeul because I'm a K-Pop Fan. Reading/Writing Hangeul is a little bit easier for me but the funny thing is, I can read/write but I cannot understand what it means... But learning Hangeul for me is really fun...$$I love hangeul and learning it for more than a decade now!! Hahah! It's really very unique and it's easy to learn!!! And of course I love and admire the one who created it---- King Sejong!! 진짜짱이다!!!$$I lived and taught in S. Korea from 2002-2006. I got married (to a S. Korean) in Seoul in 2005, and we had our first daughter there in 2006. Sadly, I never learned how to read or write during the four years I was there. We moved back to the U.S. in 2006 and have been back to visit family and friends every 3 years. Last time in Summer of 2014 my wife and our girls went in mid-May and I went (because of work) in mid-June. For that month, I took a few lessons from a Korean neighbor to show up, surprising my wife and her parents with my new Korean reading abilities. It was easy to learn (as everyone says), I sure did surprise them with my reading in the car coming home from the airport, and what's most-- I still kick myself for never learning earlier when I lived there for 4 years!$$I taught myself the alphabets through internet and variety shows and now I can read em in moderate speed and Im constantly learning new words every day and how to use them. The only thing I havent done is learn how to construct sentences properly in Korean but Im getting there. For now I can understand just fine, just to reply back in Korean it takes me a while to do it. Learning Korean is so much fun :)$$I can read and write hangeul.
Though i can understand about 60% in a conversatio, I'm still learning about word meanings. I hope i can continue and improve grammar as well.$$Emmh..
