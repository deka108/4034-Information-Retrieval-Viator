Add to it TPP issue (which was originally designed to curb China), when US and others had dropped it, ur idiotic PM continued pushing for it. What an idiot.$$Big bully! U just made yourself  unrespectable n untrustworthy internationally and shows everyone your true colors. Why dun they hv the guts to detain the vehicles when the vessel is in mainland China? Can we hear some response from hk instead of some chinaman since this incident violates hk regulations.$$Singapore should just tell China to give it back and if they don't want to just say, whatever we write them off.  We got plenty of money and have other things to do. Not a biggie...... And after 1 year send them a cheque or hv them returned. Don't make a fuzz and play their game.$$Most of TSL'S followers are young people. I won't be suprised that they do not even know that this incident even happened at all.

Model: Symone Oei ","Just visited. Nice ambience, free wifi, TVs all over, kids corner was a nice touch. 

Ordered the dinner set, after some time asked them when's the food coming and they asked ""so what drink did you order?"" I know Jia Lat Liao. When the food came bak ku teh soup was not hot, satay was ok, ice holicks was diluted, hot holicks was ok, after about an hour I'm still waiting for my nasi briyani. Service speed is like 1/10. Maybe teething issues. But don't come hungry. You'll die of hunger before your food appears.

Update, briyani still mia. Kitchen didn't prepare. Cancelled my order, owner wanted to charge me 2 drinks and a scoop of ice cream. Half way keying in said he won't charge anything. Funny thing is walk past the kitchen the staff were all standing around doing nothing.$$the Indian in me is calling out blasphemy, but looks like a shiok leh$$disgustingly horrid place with effing' bad service with China waitresses who dont even know what they are serving. no crowd yet food took 20 mins to come with multiple wrong orders like almost 5times. had like 8 or maybe more waiters over there but no crowd yet all acting busy and no one bothers to give you the menu or to seat you either. 
took the wrong order and they didnt even bother to ask what was the correct order and just walked off leaving us with no order. really OMG. dont bother trying seriously. SERVICE SUCKS SHIT!$$Went there already, portion quite small and a bit ex.  Prata texture not as good as expected, still have dough not cooked enough.  Chilli crab sauce normal, salted egg prata normal.  Mushroom chicken prata dom not bad but price and taste compared to a mushroom chicken pie elsewhere, it lose out.  Ice cream and waffle was ok.  Overall speed for food poor.$$Is the model or blogger even genuine about her comments for the food served? Food is not served hot. Gave wrong order even when we ordered from tablet. Food is just average but pricey. Only good thing we had here was the french fries with cheese, 10 bucks for it though. 

Sad to say but really upset with my experience. Never gonna visit here again I guess.$$I went there today after seeing this post. 

NOT IMPRESSED. 

The soup with the garlic stick was good, but the soup was luke warm. 
The chilli wrap was not too bad, but serving was a tad small. 
We also had the mushroom chicken prata bomb, which, to be honest, you might hafta put a gun to my head before I pay for it again. 
We waited 15mins for it, and the fillings were Luke warm, and it tasted horrid. 
The lemon tea was nice, albeit a tad too sweet 

We left the place filling hungry after paying 35 dollars 

At least now I know not to trust everything I see on FB. :)$$Blogger is paid to write a positive review even how fcked up the food and service. Nothing beats the classic original Indian prata with spicy curry fish!$$It's an awesome place with great food and pleasant ambience. I can just sit there the whole day, eat, drink, meet friends and study. Love Big Street! More importantly, the cook always prepares special vegetarian dish for me. Very happy and grateful. üëç$$Went there for lunch, no comments about service. It was okay. But the food was terrible, sad to say. Might have been the indian in me, but the curry was like water(?) the chilli crab was more like ketchup and the pratas were just meh
Theres better prata for less than half the price outside$$Went on a week day lunch so no crowds at all.. Food was so so .. Honestly a little pricey for the average standard ..the briyani reminded me of my army days. Can go just for ambience .$$Disappointed with their service too! Went there sometime in July, walked in and was told fully booked for dinner & that was it. Service ended there & we just walked out. Won't go back anymore$$Wow, so many bad review abt tis cafe.

The Jeju Cherry Blossom Festival is April 6-8, more info here: http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_2_1.jsp?cid=700677$$That's great!!!

I'm hoping to take my pre-wedding photoshoot in Jeju with the cherry blossoms around April 4.

One of the best spots in Jeju for cherry blossoms is in Seogwipo around the Jeju Sports Complex.$$Thank you! Seogwipo is to far since I'm living in Jeju-si, would it be too crowded to shoot on Friday, April 6 up in the city during Cherry Blossom festival? Should I do it a couple of days earlier?$$Dear Thai-An Pham, according to the forecast above, the cherry blossoms are expected to start blooming on March 24 and peak around March 31st at Seogwipo, so you could definitely do it a few days before April 6 and be able to get good pictures of the blossoms without the crowds. The festivals tend to be more crowded on the weekends than weekdays, so Friday might be okay as well.$$That's great, thanks! I will have to talk with the photographer about it.$$Will i be able to see it in Seoul from 17th April to 22nd April?$$Thanks! I will be in Seoul 5 Apr - 9 Apr.

 #MyVisitKoreaStory$$#MyVisitKoreaStory from July 2016 is a different kind of travel story because it is not about nature, the grand palaces or the unique food in Korea. This photo is inside the venue of a concert I attended in the Olympic Stadium. It was a very memorable experience to be joining the fan chants while EXO performs. During this trip I also got to know fans from U.S., Australia, Japan and France and knowing that Korean pop music has inspired them enough too to make a trip to Seoul. This trip made me see the intense K-pop culture of the youth while still being friendly towards foreign fans. This was a very different trip for me because I used to make trips to immerse myself into Korea's nature, busy shopping streets, art cafes and grand palaces. This was a trip that made me closer to my fandom and also fulfilled my wish of watching my favorite K-pop group right there in their home country. Truly, a beautiful memory I will always keep with me.$$My first trip to Korea with my daughter's! It was a dream come true. I was born in Korea and went back when I was little. I wanted to go back with my mother but she passed away in 2008. I always told my daughter's that we would go to Korea and it finally happened this year.  It would be awesome to go back and see the rest of the country of my mother. #MyVisitKoreaStory  May 2016$$#MyVisitKoreaStory Having to immerse in their local culture I decided to try out their street food stalls which is really fun. Seeing the friendly lady cooking for me and the grilled aromatic of the fresh seafood and meat just simply makes my stomach growling really loud which lucky the Locals beside me are too busy chatting away.$$Photo was taken when autumn season in November 2015 that was my last day for trip of korea. Feel like at home. I am fall in love with korea at the first sight when i saw a drama Autumn in My Heart. This country is so beautiful and makes me always wanna go there. I will waiting for my lovely Knight and go back there to lock our love forever.
#NamsanSeoulTower
#MyVisitKoreaStory$$I am from Indonesia, a tropic country where it has only two seasons: dry season and wet season. Therefore, I have a dream willing to experience other seasons like spring, winter and autumn in different country. Then I choose South Korea for my autumn experience. Here, I went there on last October 2015. I visited Soeraksan and Nami Island. Those places were fullfiled with yellow ginkgo and red maple trees where the leaves falling everywhere. It was definitely beautiful. I never see maple and ginkgo before because they doesn't grow in Indonesia, and finally I touched them. Love it! #MyVisitKoreaStory$$I want to participate this event. I has uploaded my photo not sure that I'm do it the correct way or not cos I didn't see my post at Korea Tourism Organization webpage, kindly let me know I'm successful posted.$$Samcheongdong Hanok definitely caught my attention the moment I stepped on there. That place is simply picturesque and while in pictures it may not look interesting but trust me, the moment you reach there you really want to take as many pictures as possible and keep all the memories forever with you because that place just looks so beautiful and stunning. #MyVisitKoreaStory$$I was in Gyeongbokgung Palace back in this May and it's one of the most important and beautiful site to visit while in Seoul. The view inside the palace just looks stunning and it's pretty big place too walk around too. The construction and roof tiles is definitely unique and artistic for the ancient palaces. There is also a museum and there are just so many things to see and of course many pictures to take too :D. I'm looking forward to visit Gyeongbokgung again in another season during winter when the view is completely different from Summer. #MyVisitKoreaStory$$#MyVisitKoreaStory This meal at Jinokhwa Halmae Wonjo Dakhanmari is situated at an alley at Dongdaemun (ÎèôÎåÄÎ¨∏) never failed to erase off my memory for the best delicious chicken pot that can be so exciting with the variety of condiments, kimchi, rice cakes and noodles that surprisingly from a plain chicken hotpot that can magically turn into the best Chicken Hot pot that I ever tasted in my whole life.

That's why on my first solo trip during autumn in Seoul, I took the time to visit Seoraksan located in the nearby province of Seokcho. I reached this beautiful mountain via the Dongbu bus line. Upon reaching the foot of the mountain where the trails begin, the orange and yellow leaves of the trees of Seorak are already visible. There are a lot of hiking trails and you can choose from which way to begin by the signages. I went to Biryong falls, Myeonsangil path, path to Biseondae rocks and Sinheungsa temple. Although I was not equipped enough to go to Ulsanbawi where the famous rigged stony trail is found on the way to the summit. It was a very manageable day hike for my first time hiking the trails alone. The tension bridge in the picture leads to a falls located deeper into the hiking trail. I plan to be back in spring and explore the nearby places around Seokcho.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

I would not dare proclaim that I deserve to win, but I would love to enjoy some couple time with my other half, Lim Eve, on our 3rd Anniversary on 13th January 2017!

The suite with city skyline looks super awesome; love the fact that the pool feels like a ""private pool""; we can get to enjoy some couple workout together in the gym-with-an-awesome-view; probably immense ourselves at Haji Lane; get to play Xbox and Pool for free; indulge ourselves with room service; enjoy the complimentary continental breakfast; shuttle our way into CDB. What is not to love at this incredible holiday home!

If I were to win this, we could get to enjoy all that Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road, Singapore has to offer! Looking forward to our staycation at Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road, Singapore soon!$$I've been working extremely hard for the family, and am keeping the whole lot of us going on a single income. I won't set aside for a vacation normally, so winning a staycation would be a splendidly nice and pleasant holiday for everyone, especially for the wife who has been holding the fort so well at home.$$Liked and shared!

Hope to bring the family for a staycation to pamper my wife with not much complaints , for always stingy on herself but spending on me the husband and the kids instead. 

Always the last to sleep, 2nd to wake up, when one of the kids awake, she have no choice but to wake up too. Always the last to eat, making sure the kids ate and are full. Always last to bath, cause she have to settle the kids! Always last in everything! Hope to win to bring her for some quality time and strengthen the bonding with our kids!

Kiri Kyuki$$liked and shared. because my BFF is heavily pregnant and can't fly for the christmas season. As a first-time mom, everyone's telling her to rest before the nightmares start. I am sure she will appreciate the tranquillity of the Pan Pacific serviced suite and be able rest till her heart's content before she pops on CNY. Joyce Liang$$Hello TheSmartLocal.com and pan pac, thanks for organising this staycation giveaway!
For me, I'd hope to win it for my dad and my mom. We generally don't travel much together and hence, don't stay in hotels also because my parents find it too expensive. I hope they get to experience the luxury and comfort that others enjoy too. There was once my dad mentioned that he wanted to bring us to a hotel buffet as a surprise weekend lunch. Hearing that made me realise how special a buffet, much less one held at a hotel was for him, even though we might consider it to be nothing much. Therefore if they get to stay there, I can imagine how it will come as a huge shock and surprise for the both of them.

Thank you so much!
Merry Christmas & happy new year to the teams at smart local and pan pacific hotel (:$$A year of hard work slogging earning that income to pay off of our wedding.

My husband had to undergo spinal surgery. For 9 weeks, I was his primary caregiver. This life changing event has definitely made our marriage stronger. It will be sometime before we are able to travel again; hence a staycay over this joyous festive season will be significant for us.$$liked and shared

Warren Soo$$As my partner and I are currently in a long distance relationship, time spent together in Singapore when I'm back in town are precious to us. Due to my partner's work commitment, we are not able to travel overseas for holidays. A staycation in Singapore would be perfect as it allows us to spend quality time together as a couple despite work constraints. Furthermore, this gives me the opportunity to become a tourist in my home country, appreciating Singapore's beauty after being away in a foreign country for so long.$$Liked and shared! Would like to win this staycation for my parents who didn't have a chance to go on a holiday for years. Their schedule are always tight down by work and even a short cruise or 3D2N trip are too demanding.

My partner and I have been struggling in a long distance relationship due to the 7hours time difference and work schedule, and paying for a house. Although she will fly back a few times a year, it is diffuclt to plan for an overseas trip together. A staycation at one of the top hotels in Singapore would really help us to spend quality time together and rejuvenate as a couple in the midst of work. thank you!$$Like and shared!

You've been picked as the winner for this giveaway. Please PM us with your Name, IC number, and Email Address, and we'll get back to you soon :)$$I'm especially interested in the Multi-Sport Mode as I enjoy doing lots of activities such as running, trekking, rock climbing and boxing and it would be good to track my fitness level, track distance and also my progress over time! Nothing can stop me from being fit and keeping a healthy lifestyleÔøΩ$$I'm interested in the Cardio Fitness Level mode because I have started to resume my workouts recently, but I feel that my stamina is really really bad compared to years ago and I'll like to see what level it is at now to have a better judgement of the execises I should be pushing myself to do :)$$Definitely most excited to use the continuous heart rate monitor (HRM) on the Fitbit Charge 2. Till now, Fitbit is the only HRM I can find, that stores heart rate data at 1 second intervals during exercise tracking and at 5 second intervals all other times. Other HRMs usually measure continuous heart rate every few minutes. Fitbit's higher frequency should result in more accurate resting heart rate (RHR) figures, which can be an indicator of your overall health. The lower your RHR, the better. :)$$I am most excited to use the Cardio Fitness Level!!! After childbirth n stepping into middle age now, metabolism dropping n all, my body shape has been growing ""wider"" n has not since stop growing this way! Lolx. I've decided I really shd do something about it, for my sake, for my hubby's sake, for whatever goodness sake! I cannot end up looking like a Hippo! So.... I've just started going on a healthy diet (God Bless Me!) and signed up for a gym membership! Set my goals n hope to achieve it. I am 200% sure The Cardio Fitness Level mode in Fitbit Charge 2 will definitely surely confirm guarantee chop help me to set my targets n achieve my goals! It will help me know my true fitness level n let me make improvements with its awesome personalized Cardio Fitness Score! Ok too long post!

Gamshahamidah The Smart Local and Fitbit for this contest!$$Reminders to Move function would be the most helpful for me since I have a desk job so I lead a rather sedentary day-to-day lifestyle except for when I hit the gym. I have the original Fitbit Charge since March 2015 which recently broke and died on me, so I would love to be able to upgrade and go back on track with Fitbit!$$It's definitely the sleeping function for me... I'm still awake at this hour and it's so difficult for an insomniac to sleep. Maybe with the watch, I'll be more conscious of what I do throughout the day to plan my sleep cycles better.$$I am really excited to try out the personalized Guided Breathing Sessions, I think it will be really useful and keeps me focus, from the daily accumlated stress. Also, the Cardio Fitness Level function is really great for beginners like me to improve on my fitness level, and i believe it'll definitiely help me to achieve my fitness goals :)$$I am excited to see how the cardio fitness level function can help me to keep track of my exercises!

Fitbit charge 2 would do the job just fine!!$$I am excited to try the personalized Guided Breathing Sessions. Never know that fitbit can have such interesting function. Will be helpful for me i hope since i always feel my breathing techniques are wrong somewhere but yet i could not pinpoint the mistakes.$$Using the Cardio Fitness Score, Fitbit provides an easier way to understand where I stand with a fitness level rating based on my age range and gender (from poor to excellent). This allows me to know where I stand as I make changes to improve over time.$$I love the fact that you can switch between the different modes, allowing you to be able to keep track of which activities you're doing specifically! Best part is that it comes with 5 different faces for the watch portion, allowing you to pair it with daily wear seamlessly.$$The most exciting function i would like to use would be the Cardio Fitness Level as I could get a better understanding of my fitness level and see how I could improve over time with a personalized Cardio Fitness Score. Hopefully, I could have the chance to use it... :) Like and shared.$$The sleep function to track how well I've slept & it allows me to watch my sleep cycle even better & of course the cardio fitness level so that I will be able to see what I can improve on for my fitness level & strive to go higher! üòå

My favorite! hahaha$$@Amanda: Any special kind of candy?^^ @Siew Yen: Chopsticks are a great gift, since Korean chopsticks are rather unique!$$Anything with Korean writing! Lol the Korean version of starburst were a big hit! Also the hard candy fruit flavored with the gooey insides. Not sure what either of them were called sorry! Chocolate is always great from any part of the world!  $$My family just loved looking at all the hangul and eating everything it was a big box I sent them for Christmas and everyone wanted to try everything then they saved the wrappers for souvenirs!

If buying for yourself - Korean drum, Korean art, jewelry with a Korean theme (There is a shop at Insadong where you can get a silver ring inscribed with whatever you want in Korean), chopstick set, wedding ducks, inlaid pearl jewelry box (although better for a female ;-))
For other people, pens with either Korean scene or Korean money (won) an alternative could be drink coasters. Be the reds t-shirt or bandana, magnets of people in hanboks or little cloth phone charms which can also double as Xmas tree deorations, chopsticks or placemat sets, traditional pencil cases are good for children.

You want more fun in the Philippines? The 100 islands are a must see. 
Wanna go swimming? Diving? Snorkeling? Beach-Camping? Riding an island-to-island zipline? Sight-seeing? Then the Hundred Islands Tour is just the thing for you..and it's cheap too!Fantastic, amazing islands. Nature at its finest. The boat people were so courteous. Everyone travelling to Pangasinan must come here and see for yourself. It is very tourist friendly. The water was crystal clear and we very much enjoyed the snorkeling. Be sure to go snorkeling and try some of the other activities like fishing or kayaking if you have the time and don't forget your camera!                                                                 #TagtheFun
#tpbgovph
#itsmorefuninthephilippines$$One of the reasons why I decided to travel this butt-numbing ride to Bicol is to witness the long-heard perfection of Mayon Volcano. And as I found myself closer to it, I was able to see its cracks and edges, its bumps and its imperfections. So I have learned that what other people, books, news and magazines have said and continue saying is wrong. But the thing is, I didn't find myself disappointed of seeing it just because of those things; for it taught me lessons I will forever treasure.  1. What other people see, think or say is not always right. Sometimes you have to see it for yourself to prove it.  2. There are few things that do not have to be perfect for you to love them. It will always get down to acceptance of the flaws rather than pointing of what is wrong.  And 3. Like Quentin, I disagree to Margo when she said that everything is uglier closer. Sometimes there's beauty in knowing what it is really like.  Like in us humans, some people are afraid to let others in because of the fear of being too exposed; that those people might use it to judge them; but it is not always like that.  There are still few that when they get to know you better, when they discover what you truly are, they will still understand, accept and love for whatever you are. But just a piece of advice, you still have to be careful of choosing who to expose your life with.#TagTheFun#ItsmorefuninthePhilippines#tpbgovph$$White Cove Beach Resort, Laiya, Batangas

Marie$$Hi Gregory.  It was brought to my attention that my comment appears to call your photos ""garbage"".  However, the comment was directed at my own photos which I provided a link to.  

At the time, I shot in JPEG, something you know limits ones ability to make edits.  Also, I edited the photos with Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006, a weak editing program.  Furthermore, I used zero sharpening.  Thus, my photos are undeniably ""garbage"" compared to what they could be.  I still have the original JPEGs, so I plan to go back and use Capture NX2 and re-do the whole process.

Sorry for the confusion.  I wouldn't call another person's work ""garbage"" unless they asked for an honest opinion from me and I truly felt that way.

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.""

What is it?
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact:
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

What is it? 
This island group is composed of the main Olango Island and its six satellite islets. The site is a wildlife sanctuary that serves as a pit stop for migratory birds that come from as far as China, Japan and Siberia.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Fun Fact: 
The seven islands of the Olango group are joined together by a continuous reef. This makes the site a nice diving spot as well.

Offers its programs to weaken and the gradual elimination of surface and underground earthquakes and rehabilitation of the water balance of the Philippines. 
The same or similar activities will be held in all the ASEAN countries, which will lead to improvement of the environmental and economic situation in the ASEAN countries and the Commonwealth of GDP growth.
First.
Quote: ""In the Philippines, for the year on average, there is more than 35 earthquakes (on average by 3 earthquakes per month) magnitude of 5.0 - 5.9, one earthquake of magnitude 6.0 - 6.9 or 7.0 - 7.9, then this country can be considered one of the most seismically active areas in the world. ""
Philippines - a country of many mountain formations. Mountain formation, adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates of thousands of years are in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. Take two bricks to hold them together metal strip, and will be heated. According to the law: solid body expands when heated, bricks expand and collapse. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists "". The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate slipped under another"" And such, and the smaller joints in the Philippines and around it - tens and hundreds.
Treatment. Cooling Philippine land and water in the surrounding seas. Terms reduce the amount of power and ground and underground earthquake and tsunami 7 years - 15% per year.
The second - the restoration of the water balance.
Within three months, it will be organized the production of crystal clear drinking water, and enriched with all kinds of trace elements, including iodine,
Drinking water in the first year will go to hospitals, schools, preschool centers of large cities and tourist centers, and then as the water production growth will fully satisfy the needs of the entire state.
Irrigation water will ensure the restoration of rivers and ground and underground reservoirs in the level and purity. This will increase the productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, increase in agricultural and meat dairy products), and the cultivation of new forests arrays. You will be met and many other works.
Conclusion.
Such proposals Philippines will not get from anyone, and all the disasters will increase and the number and power, and destroy the economy.
Visas in the Philippines nor I, nor the managers are not needed. Better to call me as a specialist for three months. During that time I, or one of the managers of our bearings, and someone left who - no, but a visa is not the main thing.

But guests should not be pressured or obligated to give more money just because it is hosted at a five-star hotel.

Here‚Äôs why.

http://mustsharenews.com/wedding-angpow-rate/Here is why you should not feel pressured into giving a big red packet when you are attending a wedding dinner at a high-class place!","Red packets are a gift by the guest to the wedding couple. Don't turn it into a profit making business. It's your choice to choose an expensive location, it is my liberty to give a 'gift' that I can afford and reflecting my economic ability at the moment. It's a wedding invitation, not a Ticketed dinner event.$$Because Singaporean are being considerate as friends, neighbors and relatives. And because Singaporean fear losing ""Face Water"", some takes advantage of the situation. 

However, I have a friend (very wealthy himself) told his son (who was about to be married), do not expect the invited guests to keep up with amount in angpows since the wedding was held at top class hotel. And that should be rightfully so. Friends, neighbors and relatives should only present a wedding gifts they meant to be and affordable.$$Every couple wants the best,parents want to please relatives and friends to save face for themselves as well as for the newly web couple.
Remember the package include a lot of other expenses in which the Hotel/Restataunts/Event companies put in.
Actually based on the food alone it should not worth that much.
$800-$1000 is consider high.
So your red package should not be more than $280 per couple or $120 per person.
It is the real market rate.$$Well said.  It is a vicious cycle.  Give whatever you feel comfortable in giving as it is only a blessing and not fair for you to foot the couple's wedding dinner bill. 

Anyway, nowadays, eating less is more healthy. I suggest consider a 4 course dinner instead of a 8 course dinner will halve the cost of hosting the event or consider a buffet,  $10 per pax can help stretch $5,000 to feed 500 guests or 50 tables.$$If you do not have a big head, please do not attempt to wear a big hat which doesn't fit.

The zipline tower is right on the far right end of Jumunjin Beach (when looking at the ocean). The beach is fairly well known so that should give the taxi driver an idea of where to go.

Driving through a thick forest cover to reach any place of interests is a rewarding experience. Many visitors use the town as a base to several places of interest located in the district. Traditional hand-woven textiles life will allure the ethnic tourists. 

- See more at: http://www.incredibleindia.org/travel/destination/bolangir ","We made an online booking of two rooms for two nights in KSTDC Hotel Mayura Pine Top at Nandi Hills on 26.06.2015 and 27.06.2015. We stay at Kolkata. My son works in Bangalore. We went to Bangalore for two weeks. So, we hoped that we would enjoy a quite stay for two nights in this place, as it was very close to Bangalore, only 60 kms away. 
Nandi Hills is about 4500 ft high. Hotel Pine Top is situated in a beautiful place on the hill top in an isolated place. We reached the hotel at about 17 hrs in the dusk of 26.06.2015, by climbing a serpentine hilly road and became exited to enjoy the coming nights. 
When we arrived at the reception desk of Hotel Pine Top, we found that there were some hotel personnel seated near the entrance and some guests were enjoying evening tea and snacks in adjacent dining room. On the way, we also noticed a lot of parked cars, as it was Friday, the beginning of a weekend. 
We informed the hotel personnel that we had room bookings. They advised us to wait, but none came forward. After a while, one person moved to us. We told him that we had prior booking and showed him the reservation voucher. He called another person, who took our luggage, guided us to downstairs and opened two rooms. Rooms were two stories below the reception and one would have to climb down by the stairs by the side of the building. It was drizzling and the sky was extremely cloudy.
The rooms were glass-fitted with open front view of the valley. The view was really superb. There were steps to go down to a garden. From there, vast valley was being seen. The place was really calm and quite. There was a half-circle view-point in the complex, in the same level of reception, from where the view was more wide open.
But we could not stay. When we reached the reception, we found that everyone was disliking our presence. No one greeted us, as if we were non-invitees. No one was coming forward to speak with us. The person, who moved to us informed that there was no room available. No welcome message. Later we found that there was no other boarder beside us. When we informed that we had prior reservation, he told with a stoned face that there was shortage of water and electricity, as it was a hilly area. Might be. Then came the next point. We would have to take dinner within 7 PM, as there would no electricity after 7 PM. Water would be not available after 7 PM, 
We, however, accepted the proposal as we had nothing to do and nowhere to go. But, when the rooms were opened for us, no electricity was present in the rooms. Then we found no water in the tap in the bathrooms with lots of cockroaches in the rooms and bathrooms. Rooms were not clean and linens were not fresh and at some places dirty. It was becoming dark and we were horrified to find that big rats were moving freely inside the rooms and bathrooms. Street dogs were freely circling in the corridor and garden. We also came to know that mobile network would not work there. We were puzzled to think what to do in that evening. However, we decided not to stay in that horrible place. There was also no telephone connection between the rooms and the reception upstairs. So, at night, if there would be any emergency, we would find our way through rodents and dogs to go to reception upstairs, might be no one would be available there. After a good thought, we did not take any risk to stay there. Luckily, Bangalore was not far away.
We came back to the reception with our luggage and asked for the complaint book. When we told the hotel personnel that we would not stay, none asked us the reason, as if it was a better decision. We also noticed that in the complaint register, there were similar complaints by the previous boarders/customers, but KSTDC took no step. We wrote our grievances in the complaint register, but till date, no official from KSTDC/Karnataka Government telephoned us or made any query. We understood that though we noticed a lot of cars, all those people would return back to Bangalore in the evening and none would stay there at night. But we came from Kolkata,a far away place, to enjoy and were cheated. Probably, KSTDC/Karnataka Government does not have time to bother in such petty matter.
On our way back to Bangalore, we found other nearby hotels/resorts/lodges with electricity arrangements. We toured to other hilly remote places, even in high altitude, where supply of power were arranged at least upto 9/10 pm. Nandi Hills is a very good place for 1-2 nights stay, as it is very near to Bangalore. We could not understand why Karnataka Government was not developing the place. The hotel is beautifully placed, rooms are not bad, a big restaurant is attached, approachable road is there and lots of tourists come to this place. Only some developments, like electricity, water and mobile tower, are to be made. Then many other hoteliers will be interested to come to this place and the place will turn into a hot tourist spot. It is a good business opportunity for the local Government and also an avenue for development of local people. Instead of improving the place, KSTDC is charging higher for the weekends. The tariff of a double-bedded room was Rs.1150 in normal weekdays, whereas in the weekend it would jump to Rs.1500, which we had to pay in full. We felt very sorry that we could not enjoy this beautiful place. State Government is turning a deaf ear to the complaints made by the past boarders/customers, as the hotel personnel should inform the authorities that we left the hotel without staying. It was a case of cheating in the part of Karnataka Government. It is known to common people like us that the hotels/lodges run by Government/state bodies are safer and better places than the private ones.
We hope that Karnataka Government/KSTDC should be ashamed for charging boarders/customers without giving any normal basic amenities and should make booking after developing the hotel and area.

While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

You've been picked as the winner for this giveaway. Please PM us with your Name, Phone Number, last 4 digits of NRIC (Sxxxx123A), and we'll get back to you soon :)$$I will like to see Lothar Matthaus in action......simply because he's the captain of the world cup champion team and the winner of Ballan D'or .........it's a rare opportunity to see such a true legend to demonstrate his skill here in Singapore

Singapore$$I would like to see Darren Anderton in action as it's been 21 years since he set foot on Singapore soil. 26th May 1995 was the day he missed a penalty and the only time Singapore team won against a premier league team. That was the day he became my favorite England player as he was so gracious in defeat and I'm going to get him to sign on the very ticket if I win! I still keep it for 21 years as I know he will be back one day. Hope being a hardcore and loyal supporter of NUEVO VINO wines will help me fulfil my dream of meeting my favorite England player! I have certainly prepared myself for this Masters! üòç$$Firstly , I'm spoilt for choices which player I would love to meet as ALL of them are stars indeed in their respective experience and teams back then.

The German legends simply outcast the England team in general. They have several World Cup experience in depth in almost all individuals. Though I may said that Lothar Matthaus is one of the finest World Cup winning captain, I would prefer to meet TEDDY SHERINGHAM in person instead.

For one simple reason when Man United claimed the treble trophy in 1999.  I am among ONE OF THE MILLIONS Manchester United fans around the world n Singapore who loves watching his goal against Bayern Munich back then.

Big Teddy is my hero...forever!
I am all set to meet him and have prepared a jersey for him to sign and have a photo with him. I hope my December birthday wish comes early this time round.

Thank you, NUEVO VINO and TheSmartLocal.com for this contest opportunity!$$After Paul Scholes announced his retirement in 2013, football lost an icon. Now, I have the chance to watch the best English player plays. It will definitely be an eye opening experience!$$Throw away club rivalry and bring on national pride. Every legend players counts. 1st time SG is honoured to have the battle of Europe. Who can forget the 5-1 England beat Germany with goals from Heskey, Gerrard and Owen and of course Didi Hamman for scoring the last goal in England old Wembley. Revenge is surely on the card with countries at stake. Didi is surely the one that I love to catch him in action again as he once scored a stunner against Man Utd last year. We are blessed to have great sponsors for such a great sporting event in this part of the world Asia. Way to go !!! 

Thank you and wish me luck.$$Wow! I look at all the comments the competition among the hardcord fans is strong, especially all the collectibles they have!! I wonder would I still have a chance to win this, nevertheless still gonna try.

I would like to see Paul Scholes!! I remember during my secondary school days watching all the matches he played and playing it on fifa. and Paul scores! Those were my younger days. This is a match not to be missed by all the legends. Match of a lifetime!$$Paul Scholes!!! Not only he played for my beloved Man Utd football club ...He is a true midfield maestro not only he can tackle, and his passing and shooting is of the highest level. to meet him will be a dream come true for me!$$Without a doubt, I hope to meet Teddy Sheringham as who can ever EVER forget his exploits in Man United champions league final against Bayern Munich!!! Even though I am a gooners fan, I just have to applaud Teddy as considering his age, he shouldn't even be playing with that much intensity!!! Heck, for me at that age, even climbing the stairs up 7 storeys will make me panting for breath every step!!! At 50 years old this year, Teddy deserves the accolades for a successful career and I definitely can see him scoring at least 1 goal in the match!!!!

So KUDOS to the main man Teddy and I hope to shake this legend's hands and oh ya, I need to get this gold plated card of Teddy signed!!! So give me a chance to fulfill my dream!!! Thanks, TheSmartLocal.com and NUEVO VINO!!!$$Can't wait to catch DIETMAR HAMANN in action, cos he is one of the best Defensive Midfielders of his time and well more importantly hope to meet him cos I missed getting his autograph the last time out :)$$Hope to get a chance to finally watch the Ginger Prince Paul Scholes play in real life and not on tv as I have twice failed to catch his matches during my time in England. Always a step ahead of everyone else as per Luis Figo's quote ""I am star-struck when I see Paul Scholes because you never see him. On the pitch you can't catch him. Off the pitch he disappears.""$$Definitely Paul Scholes for me !! Seeing him in action on TV and in real life will be totally different experiences !! I am surely looking forward to the game !!$$I would like to see Paul Scholes live in action because my favorite epl club is Manchester United and Paul Scholes is a of one the legend star player in the club.$$It would have to be Paul Scholes; I first met him in 2014 before Ryan Giggs' first game as interim manager against Norwich City. I jokingly queried if he was going to make a second comeback, having previously been coaxed out of retirement by Sir Alex Ferguson. To the disappoint of the fans, he said ""no chance mate""! 

On top of being such an affable character and a man of few words, he used his performances on the pitch to do the talking. The long and varied passes that were pinged with such accuracy, something that Manchester United is currently lacking. He was the one who made me understand that football was more than just about scoring goals; he made playing football seem so effortless.

He is the sheer epitome of all-round talent, and I do hope that I would get to meet and see him grace the pitch again.$$give me a CHANCE to CHEERS with Emile Heskey again maybe this TIME we shall TOAST with wine anyway he BREAKS through DEFENCES like NOTHING$$Paul Scholes. Cos he once challenged C.Ronaldo to hit a tree 50m away in 1 shot and he won hands down! That guy can pick a pass when no one else can!$$I wanna see stuart pearce, gareth southgate n chris waddle take penalties against germany again... ;p$$Definitely Daniel Ben Murphy!

We keep saying we'll do something new, rest assured that's what we're gonna do. The Kallang Wave to Wow. :)$$I want watch the ginger prince score a screamer at our national stadium.$$I want to see Paul Scholes in action.
In year 2001, Paul Scholes visited Singapore with his teammate. I was studying my O Level during that time. I told my mum I want to travel to Singapore to watch the team played especially Paul Scholes who is my idol since I was a kid. My mum said she will pay all my expenses if I can score straight As in my O' Level. This motivated me so much and I managed to visit Singapore and watched the team played. 
Without him, I may not have so much motivation to excel in my O' Level. So now I got the opportunity to thank him in person. I wish NUEVO VINO & TheSmartLocal.com can give me the opportunity to meet my idol. Thanks.$$Paul Scholes and Teddy Sheringham vs Jurgen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff$$I want to see Steve McManaman in action at our National Stadium on Nov 12! He is from my favourite Team LiverPool. Steve McManaman is the first Englishman to win the Champions League with a non-English club and also the first English player to win it twice! Remarkably Remarkable! Really hope that I can win this and be there to support him!

And even more greater thing is that KTO always listens to people and tries to make it even better :) Excellent$$When I'm using the term culture I mean it in the broad sense - so both traditional and modern - but sometimes the most modern is the best reflection of your culture. Like Noma in Copenhagen is a great example of using Nordic flavours in foods - http://www.theworlds50best.com/awards/1-50-winners/noma and that's for sure one of the things I'm looking forward to exploring, Korean food - and maybe that's a perfect example - Korean food itinerary?$$ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî!

Here are some things You Never Knew About Traffic/Parking Enforcement Officers (A.K.A Fatimah)

Because LTA enforcement officers are really just doing their job.

Follow Ladyironchef for more stories like this!

http://www.ladyironchef.com/2014/12/traffic-parking-enforcement-officers-fatimah/It is most definitely a Singaporean thing to call our car park attendants and traffic wardens ""Fatimah"". We are not too sure how it started too, but the term","why do LTA motorcycle officers behave like they're Traffic Police ? just what is their training? is it specialised training?? Exactly what are their powers ? does it included any power to arrest members of the public? are they allowed to engage in pursuit of suspected illegal vehicles? members of the public have been speculating all of the above questions and more, perhaps someone could give some insight as to just what their powers are?$$üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª as much as I empathize with the pay structure and all. It still doesn't give them a right to behave like they are the king of the roads. Yes, civilians should not try to challenge the existing traffic rules, but LTA wardens should be a little bit more forgiving?  
I have personally seen taxi/Lorry driver uncles running with their might to get out of the No waiting zones . And all I see is an unsympathetic warden pressing with their might on that summon machine like they are playing the final stage of game of thrones. So yah~ whatever it is. 3 million BOoooos üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª$$If I was the LTA officer and any member of the public comes so close to me in menacing way, I would have threw the punch too. Whatever the hell is it, you respect one's personal space. You want to scream and shout, you do it at reasonable distance. But if you come right up to my face, inches away, threatening me, all bets are off.$$Problem with Singaporean is they like to challenge public servant. Do public servant owes you a living ? They are just doing their job. If you don't flout any rules then you will not have to face them. The main thing is the public always like to give excuses such as "" only a few minutes or just once "". And if public servant gives them a foot then they expect a yard. Judge your own attitude first before you judge the public servant. Reflex on yourself, your use of words, your tone and most of all your many excuses.$$For certain area surveillance camera works very well . Minimise conflict between human , if Drivers want to pay $300 for their convenient , it is ok.. So next time use robot to issue summon ticket to those Drivers who do not know the rules .. If you want to fight robot go on .. Robot will not get agitated no matter what you tell it ..$$My personal opinion, these so call LTA enforcers r just piece of shit, when really there r illegal parking, they r no where to b found but when u happened to park at carpark or loading/unloading bay exceeding the timing, u will c a fine ticket at ur windscreen$$This so called LTA are mostly foreign bastard ! Want to come singapore and show their power ! LTA should stop employing them$$Why should we need to know . Bottom line, is beating up a civilian part of your job too?$$I saw the video on the LTA officer punching a uber driver and is being suspended of all duties. However the video also clearly show LTA officer being provoked by the uber driver whispering into his ears b4 lta officer swing his punches. Although there is no excuse to the fight however condemnation at this stage ia uncalled for.$$Sure bo? 12 hrs work 6 days a week for $900 only per month govt job? Thats 72 hrs a week.$$As much as we need to empathize their job..they shld also show more empathy especially to those delivery drivers, cab drivers etc. i am very sure these so called ""law-enforcers"" do not abide by the law themselves all the time as we can so often see them on social media parking by zig zag and double yellow lines, den went off to buy food or smoke..it's a two way respect if they want to be respected, they shld respect others and show more empathy in the first place .. Pls understand everyone is trying to earn a living and it's already a stressful thing to live in a FINE city.. More empathies will make this society a better place$$Most of the traffic/parking enforcement duties are now outsource to companies on contract basis like Certis Cisco, Aetos, Ramky, ST Technologies etc. If the contracts are not renewed, the traffic/parking enforcement officer will most likely start all over again from the base salary with another company and as a result will most often not see an increase in their salary.$$Why thankless job. .think we will be thankful without them leh.... haha$$If u cant endurance those vuglar , then dont join those service line or related government job.$$Walking pieces of shit.$$I wanna join LTA too beating and fighting FOR FUN AND THE BEST punishment IS ONLY

Doesn't justify beating someone up just because you don't like your job.$$This idiot lta (cisco) guy shout first before this thing happened. Read first before comment ! He's fucking idiot ! Think he wear LTA uniform very big is it$$If beating up is part of the job, let me knowü§ì$$Nonetheless I still despise them.$$Agree they are just doing their job but some of their attitude SUCKS...$$I won't be surprised a bill has already been passed to allow LTA officers to punch civilians.

No extra tickets required since you're continueing a journey and you already took public buses there. No need to go 30 minutes earlier and all that. Walking distance is roughly the same if you count walking to/fro/within the train station.

""Last year, I had the chance to travel to Batanes with my friend, and the chance to experience Itbayat was a big tick off my travel bucket list. There we met Nanay Cano, a resident who operates a small lodging house. She is a retired teacher who also used to be a tourism officer in Itbayat. She fondly shared with us stories how she managed to juggle both responsibilities back in the day and how her love of Itbayat made it light for her to attend to her duties.

""Tourism has been a great help for her. Through tourism, she is able to practice her teaching profession she has always loved by imparting to her guests how to fully enjoy their stay in her hometown.""

10824,240054519398747_1017496104987914,"Last week, we've started featuring stories of people whose lives have improved because of tourism. These are successful stories of our tourism frontliners who prove how inclusive the tourism industry can be. Their stories are told by various local travelers around the Philippines whose journey would not have been more fun and much easier without the help they got from their newfound friends.

This week, we begin with the story of Jacob Maentz (@jacob.maentz on Instagram), a documentary and travel photographer from Cebu:

""I met Captain Angel Torres in Bais Bay during an early morning excursion to see the dolphins of Ta√±on Strait. Ta√±on Strait lies between Negros Oriental and Cebu and is the largest protected seascape in the country. It is home to spinner dolphins, dwarf sperm whales, spotted dolphins and pygmy killer whales. Today, a number of fishermen and other locals work part-time as captains or crew for some 15 boat tours around Ta√±on Strait, Angel being one of them. Visitors can get a glimpse of the marine mammals during early morning dolphin-watching trips.

""Back in the early 90‚Äôs dolphin meat was sold for P10 per kilo and was a common part of the local diet. Marine species would also be hunted for pure sport, mainly because no one knew any better explained Angel. In the mid-1990‚Äôs much of that changed when the LGU implemented a number of environmental laws to protect the dolphins and whales in the area.  Tourism now provides a livelihood for local fishermen and the marine life is better protected. ""

I really really like to win a Korea trip because I have never ever been there yet. And my sis kept going Korea several times for 4 yrs consecutively. She has been telling me so much great things Korea offer and the nice places she has been to were so lovely and pretty. That gave me lots of insights and more urges to visit Korea so badly!!!! If I really win, I will first indulge in their Korea food because I want to taste how authentic their food is and will take lots of food pics as my spouse & I are food lovers!!! My desired #shopping item will be their food that we can't never get in Singapore and I probably will spend about S$200 on #souvenirs as I heard Korea has many handcrafted goodies. My spouse & i will be deeply grateful if I win this fantastic holiday and I intend to go during this coming December for a super white, cold Xmas to spend a lovely and memorable Korea trip for the 1st time in my life!!!

I strongly recommend for travellers who are their 1st time or frequent travellers to Korea, the food, people, places and culture are awesome, they are so low profile but they have many good things they created by the country, Samsung, Hyundi and much more are covering most of our daily needs in our living nowadays, they are so genius and the goods are so user friendly. I am trying to use most of the products made from Korea such as toothpaste and food etc. Places like Apgujeong-dong & Rodeo Street have quite many unique alleys of individual fashion shops and Italian restaurants etc. Myeong-dong is always exciting. Hongik University has many artistic values in this district where I enjoy walking along the little alleys of cafes, small theaters and outdoor festivals etc, youthful energy is very alive. Also I adore the historic parts of Korea where traditional living, culture and architecture are still kept there.

Hongmen reservoir, built in 1958, is located on the ruins of the ancient Xiaoshi Township, which was an important trade center and hub for water transportation between Jiangxi and Fujian provinces. 

The statue was somewhat preserved in the water, which prevented weathering. Archaeologists will continue research for the protection of the reservoir's underwater relics.

Among those who benefit from the earnings generated by Tourism are locals from touristic destinations who derive livelihood from it. Take the case of Kuya Eran Decena whose story is told by Cyrus John Malonzo (@the_boy_who_leaves on Instagram). 

""During my 2nd trip to #Coron, I met Kuya Eran Decena, who happens to be one of the well-known tour guides in town. He was famous that he was even featured on travel publication, Lonely Planet.

""My interaction with him indeed proved why he was well-known. First, he is very engaging and funny; there was no dull moment as we travelled from one island to the next. Second, he knows a lot about Coron, from affordable boat rides and accommodations to various detours for delicious local delicacies. And third, you can feel his love for his hometown, especially when he shared his efforts during the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda in Coron, as well as his concerns about commercial developments that pose threats on the island's pristine beauty.

""He said that when he started as a tour guide 15 years ago, there was only a handful of European foreigners visiting Coron. But with more flights and ferries leading to their town, the influx of local tourists has helped sustain their means of living. 

""He used to live in Manila and worked as a messenger for a multinational company before deciding to become a tour guide. I felt that he made the right decision because he is enjoying his job. He even promotes scenic photos of Coron on his own Facebook page. And I sincerely hope that when I get the chance to visit Coron again, he will still sport the same smile that we saw from him two years ago.""

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what‚Äôs around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to develop in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into

We are still good in our English compared to many countries ....included our written standards to some white countries...The article is a good eye opener... room for improvements$$But in general, I hope that we would one day be able to tell others that WE ARE NOT WRONG. just like there is UK and AMERICAN pronunciation, we have our local version of pronunciation. As long as the whole country pronounce the same way. So please tell me how to pronounce LETTUCE.$$It's not the pronunciation;as someone above said; all languages affect the way people pronounce English. It's the whole acceptance of singlish  that I find disturbing!$$Imagine I ask for flar at the florist.... the aunty will say "" siao cha boa....no no no... ntuc see... go ntuc ah ok gal"" when in rome live like the romans$$Lol good summary! Almost every word sounds weird from the local pronunciation..$$flour & flower have the same pronounciation, which u can find in dictionary. if u argue of having different dialect or way of pronounciation in different country, its not entirely wrong.$$http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tlsQrgBdDM$$1) Opinion seems to be divided on the pronunciation of ‚Äúflour‚Äù in the British dictionaries I consulted. The Oxford Concise Dictionary (1995) and the Oxford Advanced Learner‚Äôs Dictionary (2005) indicate that ‚Äúflour‚Äù has the same pronunciation as ‚Äúflower‚Äù, i.e.: 

 /‚Äôflau-e(r)/ ‚Äì a two-syllabled word with the stress on the first syllable ‚Äì the ‚Äúe‚Äù is a schwa, like the ‚Äòe‚Äô sound in ‚Äúmoment‚Äù).  

However, the 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary (1989) and the online Cambridge Advanced Learner‚Äôs Dictionary show ‚Äúflour‚Äù being pronounced as:  

 /flaue(r)/ ‚Äì a one-syllabled word with three vowels together (a triphthong), the ‚Äòe‚Äô in it being also a schwa. Because of the combination of the three vowels in a syllable, we tend to glide over them, resulting in a sound resembling /fla(r)/.   

 I consider both pronunciations to be correct alternative pronunciations. In fact, there is also an alternative pronunciation of ‚Äúflower‚Äù, indicated by the 20-volume OED, which is exactly like the second pronunciation of ‚Äúflour‚Äù!$$Can blame Bon Jovi for mispronouncing ""prayer"".

My motivation is not self interest, as yours seems to be, but a motivation for my wife and my 2 kids to see their grandparents and extended family in Korea.$$We really understand that everyone is passionate about this contest and can appreciate your concern, but please be assured that scores will be tallied in a fair, unbiased manner. (That's what we were trying to convey with our previous message.^^)

The ancient Mahayana Buddhist monument and UNESCO World Heritage Site of Borobudur in Central Java, Indonesia, which contains 72 stupas and 1,460 relief panels, is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, made in the early 9th century. It is unique since the intricately carved panels that weave their way through the different levels of the temple depict so many stories from the Buddha's life as shown in the Lalitavistara Sutra, as well as narratives from the Gandavyuha Sutra, the Jatakas, etc. It was said to have been inspired by the original Dhanyakataka Stupa in South India, commissioned by a king of the Buddhist Sailendra dynasty who was strongly influenced by the braoder Srivijaya empire of that time, and Jowo Atisha's Sumatran teacher Dharmakirtishri was from that Srivijaya family. Atisha spent twelve years in Indonesia to learn the meditations for developing bodhicitta and the Tara practices, so this is a very important pilgrimage area for Tibetan Buddhists as the source for many of the practices that Atisha brought to Tibet is here. There are also commentaries by Indonesian masters in the Tengyur. Atisha visited the holy temples in Java and one of his other teachers, Acharya Pindo, was also from Java. In modern times, many of the great Tibetan Buddhist masters, like HH the Dalai Lama, HH the Sakya Trizin, HE Luding Khenchen Rinpoche, et. have made pilgrimages to Borobudur, and all this inspired me to pay a short pilgrimage at the beginning of 2016. I felt deeply inspired by this beautiful and blessed place, and I think that anyone interested in bodhicitta should try to visit Borobudur too if they can. Not only can we learn a lot from it, but just to meditate here for a short time can instantly arouse strong compassion, samadhi and blessings.

The doll is modeled after Bodhidharma who is the founder of Zen sect of Buddhism, and it is traced back to more than 200 years.
When DARUMA is sold, both eyes are not painting. When you purchased it, you draw an iris on left eye. And when your wish came true, you paint an iris on right eye.

Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture, is most famous for production of DARUMA doll.

11339,225524117535380_1177235242364258,"On Monday, we published a video on our YouTube channel in which some of us tried Indian Snacks from Little India. 

It was our intention to create a video celebrating Deepavali, but because of the poor execution of the video, we ended up offending a sizeable community of fellow Singaporeans.

The video should never have been produced and we removed it as soon as we realised our mistake.

The feedback we've received over the past 2 days have been vital in helping us identify our shortcomings. This is a big learning lesson we'll take with us moving forward.

We apologise again for this mistake and we will not be producing content like this again. ","That's okay! The video was made with good intentions. Stuff just went wrong along the way. But thanks for trying! üòä$$just in case some of you missed it. singaporeans try is the name of one of their show and they have others like pretty smart, talk on the street etc. it can be singaporeans try: indian snacks, singaporeans try: chinese snacks or singaporeans try: whatever. you get the idea. regardless whether it‚Äôs chinese, malay, indian or caucasian in the title, it is just an adjective. if you felt offended because it‚Äôs racist, it‚Äôs just like saying the statement, i feel like eating malay food for lunch, is racist. tell me how would you describe the snacks that they tried in the video? 

regarding the content, if one gives a blank look when asked about a festive celebration doesn‚Äôt equate to being racist. i vaguely remember TSL doing a video on chinese new year or some chinese festival and the participants(mostly chinese) have no clue to most of the questions asked. so are they dissing their own race? their videos are meant to create awareness for the mass and some comments have forced them to take it down. this has in turn taken away the opportunity that this video has for other to learn about snacks some of us don‚Äôt even know existed. i hope i did not step on anyone‚Äôs toe with this comment. TSL, don‚Äôt be discouraged by this incident. you guys have been doing a great job.$$Had been an avid fan of the smartlocals videos as they never fail to put a smile on people's faces with their quirky content.

I had the fortune or the misfortune of watching the video that has since been taken down. I must say that It is rather sad that content was created to make people laugh at the expense of a community.

Furthermore, it just highlights the blatant privilege that exists in Singapore, and I guess that privilege is widely abundant in the smart local as well.

This ultimately point to not only a failure of the system that allowed for the creation and release of such content, but the greater ignorance that must have been present in the organization.

I hope thesmartlocal will understand that Singapore is not only defined by it's ethnic majority and that the minority groups are also part of the community. We don't deserve to be treated like outsiders to be tasted, sampled and critiqued.$$I've come to love you guys a lot. Your videos are always sincere in nature with good local content. I did not managed to watch the video to actually decide if it is truly negative in nature. If it really is as what the social media is painting it to be, it really is out of character for you guys. I hope you guys can truly learn from this and continue to be the awesome content creator in YouTube.$$Combating racism by classifying everybody according to their race & encouraging professional victimhood. illiberal means of preventing free exchange of ideas. what trigger happy singaporeans.

Rather than be quick to remove said video, keep it online for everyone to watch, to encourage an open dialogue about race.$$Dear smart local, don't stop producing awesome stuff! We make mistakes in life. Gotta move forward. People fly off the hook so easily, you Ë∑≥ËøõÈªÑÊ≤≥‰πüÊ¥ó‰∏çÊ∏Ö.$$Smart Local, I enjoy most of your contents, creative indeed. I have not seen the deepavali video, however, hope you guys can do another video with proper content and theme to cheer up deepavali. cheers$$For those wondering what was wrong with the video, this article explains it quite succinctly: http://mothership.sg/2016/10/the-smart-local-ruins-deepavali-for-sporean-indians-with-insensitive-racist-video/
Apart from the disdainful faces and comments, this line pretty much sums up why the video was so ridiculous: ""the most adverse connotation of the video was the treatment of Indians as if they are foreign to Singapore, to be sampled and passed judgement on.""$$Well guys, it's hard to not learn from it. Don't call food from someone else's culture diarrhea or anything along those lines ... 
and also... don't get ah lians (esp those with 0 sensitivity) for your videos please.$$If you were racist, apologise for your racism. Otherwise you're just missing the point and fucking up more. ""Poor execution""? Is a piss poor euphemism for what your video actually was, which was racist.$$When you have a team that is filled with Chinese majority, such ""incidents"" are the norms.

Nothing but toxic.$$TSL: so you are sorry because video was not good and poor execution and etc etc. that is why you are apologizing. But you are not sad and apologetic that you hurt the sentiments of a minority community who is as much Singaporean as others and you had audacity to just mock them and their culture and make fun or look down on them ???? How ironic, is that what your culture and values teaches you? Have you even thought if such thing would happen to you or your culture and cultural festivities then how angry, upset or sad you would feel ??? Food for thought for those on your team who could be so boldly racist, provocative and insensitive...even here in Singapore. Shame on such folks.$$This is was supposed to be a celebration of Diwali - the festival of all festivals for Indians. There is nothing celebratory about racism. This just made the divide between races That much clearer. The ignorance was sickening. I have no idea how you fathomed this was okay. Did you actually think this was funny? 

Apologise for your racist video. 
Own up to that. There is no going around the fact that this was blatantly racist.$$""Poor execution""? Why - was comparing Indian food to diarrhea meant to be said in interpretive dance?$$The word 'sorry' isn't even in here. This entire thing looks so corporate..like you know the general PR template used to fight fire. 

Apology Not personal enough really aka not sincere enough. Yet the video has hit a personal spot with the associated people.$$I did spot some flaws in the video but didnt think it would blow up. Was puzzled too they made a video abt Deepavali but I didnt spot any local Indian in the vid..$$how was such blatantly insulting content get through the editorial in the first place?! mind boggling! üò° it's an insult to the wide spectrum of cultural diversity in Singapore that you don't deserve to claim to be so Smart about.$$You should re-upload it again. 
This time, to show proof and concrete evidence that Racism and Chinese Privilege still exist.$$I'm a huge fan of TSL, but really, this is so disappointing. This is exactly why you need an Indian in your team as well to avoid these kinda screw ups.$$I seriously think there has been an unnecessary hoohah over this video. TSL should not have deleted the video and let more people watch this and form their own opinion of it instead of succumbing to the few who watched and protested. In fact, thanks to this video, I learnt of a few Indian snacks which I have not heard of and I can't wait to try them. Give these kids a break. Peace, Out.$$Donovan, for goodness sake stop trying to promote your stupid fb entry lah. It's embarrassing; using this post to gain traction on urs.$$Admin: you should name ur pg as TheStupidLocal. com That sound better.$$Does anyone have a link to the video!? How bad can the video be!? I'm curious!$$TheSmartLocal.com I'm pretty aghast to see the kinds of posts which you are responding to, and the posts which you are liking (it's terribly easy to observe this). It makes me harbour more than a little doubt about how sincere your apology is.$$Not sure why there is a need for TheSmartLocal.com to apologise. Also not sure why the people commenting here are perceiving this as a ""mistake"". The ""facts"" of this entire saga is based on the dubious hearsay of one news site and some stray Facebook comments, since literally no one's watched the video that was taken down. If anyone reading this is interested to see what I mean, read what I already wrote and tell me again that you disagree. https://www.facebook.com/donovan.choy/posts/10210855810741367?pnref=story

Not anymore, though, with these 10 items!","Update: Congrats to Valerie Ng, Ang Zhi Xin, Mariah Sanchez, Keng Choon Lee and Jessie Yap! Each winner will walk away with a pair of Keds x Taylor Swift sneakers of their choice.

A big thank you to everyone who participated in this giveaway, and to Royal Sporting House for sponsoring this contest. Head over and get your own pair - you may just win tickets to Taylor Swift's 1989 World Tour!$$Most people love Taylor Swift for her music. I mean, who wouldn't? She is incredibly talented. She writes music that is basically the anthem of our lives.
But the thing I love most about Taylor is her character. She is genuine, caring, generous, and so many other things. She is an inspiration to us.
I wish to win a pair of Taylor Swift x Keds so I can share it with my sister Jean Monique Sanchez who has been so passionate in helping me and our family. She is our Taylor, our inspiration, our hero. l wanted a pair for myself, but it would mean more if I can give it to her because the greatest sister deserves the best pair of Keds.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§$$My youngest daughter is a faithful and loyal fan of Taylor Swift since young. She always listen to her music even when she's studying for her exams claiming that her idols voice can help her concentrate and keep her cool! Well I do believe her words based on her good academic results üëç Therefore if I can win Taylor Swift 's concert ticket or her endorsed merchandise for my daughter, I trust that she will certainly be joyful ‚ù§Ô∏è$$Guess the chances of me winning this is 0.001% but still, from a 16 year old girl wearing cowboy boots and sundresses singing for small crowds to a 25 year old woman playing for sold out stadiums, Taylor showed us nothing is impossible as long as you try and give your best. I've been a Taylor Swift fan for as long as I could remember. And just imagine wearing a pair of Keds to Taylor's concert! How dope would that be?? Taylor Swift has come so far and I couldn't be more proud. CHOOSE ME CHOOSE ME please :D$$It has been 6 years since I fell in love with Taylor Swift & her music. She means so much to me because her songs got me through all the happiest & worst days in school, and she taught me how to stay positive even when life throws setbacks your way ‚ù§Ô∏è I will really really love to own a pair of Keds because Taylor's Keds collection has always stood out with its unique and gorgeous designs and I've heard that it's super comfy too for everyday wear ‚ò∫Ô∏è It will definitely be an ideal pair of shoes for every diehard Swiftie :3$$Because Taylor Swift is AWESOME and she stands up for herself in the best way and I LOVE all her songs!
Also, because my birthday is on 9 September and to get a pair of keds x Taylor Swift shoes wld be the BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER <3$$I NEED to win a pair of Keds because I'm a Keds lover and on top of that, I've never missed Tay's concert since 2011!!! And, this is absolutely the best shoes to wear on November 8!!!
PS: All of my Keds shoes are in the Philippines so I really have to get this!!! üòÅüòÜ‚úåüèªÔ∏è$$I bought my first pair of Keds long long ago in Taiwan, before the brand was even brought in to Singapore! Love it since then. The design, the print, the comfort. :) Can't imagine what kind fabulous style Taylor swift would bring into Keds. Whatever it is, I think Taylor swift can pull any style off, and make them look good!$$I wanna win a pair of Keds because I love Taylor Swift since I was 12 years old.Haha.i really loved her music.my birthday wish for this year is want to see her in real person and will be on her Singapore 1989 world tour concert as well.see you!!!taylor swift!$$Because my friend is a die hard Taylor Swift fan and I want to win this for him!

I also like keds products bcoz they are well known to offer comfy and warm wearing experience.... most of all, it's simply my STYLE  ‚ù§Ô∏è$$I love Taylor Swift, her music, her live concert, her endorsement merchandise and everything else that belongs to my idol‚ù§Ô∏è A pair of kegs x taylor swift shoes will definitely be my dearest birthday gift in my life!!!$$I would like to have a pair of Keds x Taylor Swift shoes because I'm a fan of  both! I love Taylor Swift and every song of hers, in fact will never get sick of any even after her songs have been replayed umpteen times. Didn't get a chance to get the tickets for her concert  though, so I really hope I can get something related to her at least. In addition, I've just signed up for an acoustic guitar course so it will be perfect and even more meaningful if I get to win a pair of this exclusive kicks. Oh, and I guess I don't have to explain why I love Keds, because everyone knows their designs are always so unique, pretty and most importantly, comfortable! ^_^$$I would go gaga if I would to win this as Taylor swift is the MOST AMAZING PERSON EVER. The songs she produces have genuinely never failed to disappoint her supporters, or even anyone, and this shows how talented and hardworking she is with the HUGE amount of supporters at the age of 25, shes just so amazing. Another reason why I love her is because she's tots kind and humble. Taylor's not like any other celebrity. She uses her fame to help fans from around the world with their personal problems, and also did a secret sessions at her place to fulfill the wish of her fans to meet her upfront and to interact with her despite her busy schedule. I'm also a huge fan of Keds! I have been using their White shoes for school and the quality + style is superb! I hope I'll win this, my friends will definitely be so JEALOUS of me. Thank you for hosting such an awesome giveaway! (Liked & shared! :)$$I wanna win a pair of keds x Taylor swift because I really wanted it & she inspire me to be someone bigger & better!$$I need the shoes to give to a friend of mine whom is a huge fan of Taylor swift like since forever! He would be soooooo touched when he has it!$$I want to win this pair of Keds Taylor Swift shoes as the moment i saw it at RSH, i really wanted to buy them. Especially the cream coloured ones! All of them had a special guitar pick tag and it was really unique and pretty. I've been a taylor swift fan since Secondary school and i hope i am able to wear these shoes out :)$$I don't really listen to Western music, but once, the radio was playing 'Teardrops on my Guitar' & boy, I was amazed by the unique voice behind the song..I did some research, and found out that it's Taylor Swift! Her music never fails to surprise, from country-style music when she first started, to pop music, Taylor's done it all..her never-say-die attitude was what attracted me to her music too, her perserverence towards her own style of music proofed herself right when she was top on both country charts & the Billboard chart, a feat considered for her young age...she's also able to express herself well through her songs, incorporating her life story and love lines through the marvellous renditions. 
A straight-talker, though she may have personality clashes with some artistes, but that's what I like her for-her freestyle & true spirit, which explains why she has forged great relationships like Ed Sheeran, Selena Gomez & Lorde...

All in all, she's one great & talented young diva fans like me look up to..

Hope to win the shoes & be able to wear it to her concert proudly and shout 'I'm a Swiftie' with fans alike! Hmm maybe try for a chance to get her autograph there too?$$Because Taylor Swift is awesome and I love her! <3 Taylor Swift is love Taylor Swift is life <3$$Because I have never been to a concert before and I admire Taylor Swift's attitude towards music.$$Back in secondary school when I was ""Fifteen"", all the cool kids wear Keds. Either I wasn't cool enough or just poor :-P so I had those $10 white running shoes from the Pasar Malam :-) But I wore them with pride (because they are the only pair I got). Like Taylor Swift's song ""Never Grow Up"", I guess I never grew up and let this experience down. My ""Love Story"" with Keds has not ended yet because Keds, ""You Belong With Me"" :-) I hope I have the ""Last Kiss"" and ""Walk Out of the Woods"" with a new pair of Keds x Taylor Swift from Royal Sporting House Singapore and TheSmartLocal.com. Liked both pages and liked and shared this post. Kristina Ong Dee Kacey Daisy Marian Wong$$Taylor Swift is such a huge role model to me. I love how she loves and appreciates her fans. She has such a big heart  and has donated to charities and visited sick children in hospitals despite her busy schedule. I really admire her when she sings as she puts her heart and soul in her songs. She inspires me through her songs in many ways. Taylor tells stories in songs that I can relate to. It's like flipping through my diary and every single one of her songs has so much meaning to me. Her music totally describes how I feel. Her music has gotten me through my darkest times. She has even inspired me to learn the guitar. It's amazing how I can connect my feelings through her music . I am always inspired by her style when I dress up everyday. I absolutely love her girly sense of style and her line of keds shoes reflects that. Wearing the pair of keds, I can walk on this journey with her. With the keds shoes, I would be able to walk closely with her. It will also serve as a reminder for me to always push through obstacles and chase after my dreams. If I could borrow her style and wear it everyday, I would be overjoyed to the moon and back. It would mean the world to me if I could wear her line of keds shoes everyday. <3$$It would be so awesome and coooool if im able to win Taylor Swift x Keds shoes as i've always want to own a pair of my own.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

What is it?
In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

In Ifugao and every other part of the country, the best tour guides are the locals. They're knowledgeable, friendly and you won't have to worry too much about a language barrier.

Fun Fact:
Don't be alarmed by the red-stained mouths of Banaue locals. It's caused by the chewing of nga-nga or betel nuts, which they find addictive.

Thanks for sharing :) @Jennifer, The idea of having dogs inside one's house is a little strange in Korean society.  Think about how you should take off your shoes before you go in the house in Korea, well dogs don't have shoes to take off, so it can seem a bit unsanitary to Korean people.  There may be hotels that accept it, but you would have to ask when you make a reservation. ""it's better to beg forgiveness than ask permission"" could also be a good mantra to follow, but there's no telling how it will turn out.    If your dog is loud, or causes damage, it could be a very costly affair for you.  There are such things as dog hotels in Korea (this one is in Korean, but just take a brief look: http://hotel.dogtel.co.kr/) it could also be a good choice.

Tubbataha Reef, Palawan

What is it? 
Schooling is when a group of fish swim together in one direction. They do this to fend off predators by creating a ‚Äúconfusion effect,‚Äù where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

Fun Fact: 
Shoaling is different from schooling. Shoaling is when a species of fish are grouped close together, but are swimming independently. Tubbataha has 600 species of fish that either school or shoal.

https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/the-best-countries-in-southeast-asia-to-visit-rankedSomehow we only mention ""The Beach"" once!","Ph in the middle is abit low i think.. Except for the food complaint, i am not sure where he got his trouble with atm`s and bus seats... usually works fine for me, foreign credit cards and foreign bodytype :)   Thailand on top? only 1st  they have the right to is the food.. for the rest.. meh..  top notch thai resorts are also the best in SE Asia, but who can slosh out 800 dollar a night for that?  And they really suffer under the one thing they are really proud of.. that they never were a colony.. good for them, of course, but it also means introvertion, no curiosity towards other cultures, No foreign language skills outside main cities&tourist places.  All this is no problem for the thais,, but when considered as a tourist destination.. not so good.. One month in each place is also way too little.. i have racked up 5 months in the Ph.. and my bucket list just getting longer and longer :) As opposed to Thailand, where i was more or less bummed out by most of the things there after less than 3 months in total..$$I don't know why they love Thai foods!! My goodness I tried some of their foods especially the noodle in Bangkok and I would say it really tastes bad. The Philippines' just really not clear for some foreigners because honestly we're very different compared to our asian neighbors. They are composed of temples and other REALLY ASIAN icons and we have that big difference of having western culture and tradition which makes us not so familiar in the word ASIAN as even foreigners thinking if we're really asian or pacific islanders. But not too bad having western culture as it  doesn't makes us different from asia < I guess we're just having a big difference compare for them. #Philippines$$Not really bec she ranked PH midlist, which is not bad, bec of nonfunctional atms and small seated busses. If she had ranked the places base on the amount and quality of attractions, PH should be at least no 2 or 1.  JS$$Ranking is subjective. I just have to react to the suggestion to ""improve the cuisine"". Our food is part of who we are. Take it or leave it. And yes, we love adobo.$$I think issue with pinoy food is that we have lots of variety and havent figure out yet what we have to showcase to tourist, we have been serving them fiesta foods over and over like lechon,lechon kawali, kare kare, etc.. this are unhealthy and health conscious wouldnt rave about this
Why not develop our food identity by focusing on whats uniquely pinoy, like for soup, tinola, for vegetable laing, for chicken, inasal, for pork,pochero or adobo or even dinuguan, for fish kilawin tanigue,tinolang isda and the list goes on.

Definitely need one of this to help me keep track of the amount of calories lost and etc from exercising and show it off to her as proof!!! Last but not least, my birthday is coming and this will be a perfect gift for myself to help me regain that IPPT gold!!$$Liked and shared. I am a gym junkies and food lovers. But sometimes i can go overboard when I am gyming and eating especially dessert. So hope this fitness tracker can help me count my workout routine to balance out my diet. Hope to win. Thank you$$Liked and shared! We need to keep track of our diet & calories count because we are always indulging in good food & desserts without having enough exercise. A Misfit Shine 2 will help us maintain our health by having a balanced diet/exercise regime and keep the sickness away üòä Shem Leong$$I love to eat sweet as well as oily food, is far to maintain and develop body of a magazine cover hunk. But more importantly my main purpose is to help me get on track. Hope to own this amazing Misfit Shine 2, best fitness tracker to motivate me. The bonus point I love about Misfit Shine 2 is that I can opt to clip it to belts, shirts or even shoes!! Love it to bits!$$In order to strike a balance for a sweet tooth like me, I would want to win a Misfit Shine 2 to help me stay on track and be healthy. Moreover, Misfit Shine 2 doesn't sit on your wrist, but gets clipped on your clothing - It's so simple!$$Liked and shared
I now know things that I was oblivious to before. Ignorance was bliss. These desserts look so beautiful previously.  Now all I see are numbers when I look at them. Gotta have my Misfit Shine 2 so I could balance my in and outtake of calories so I can once again look at these desserts they way I used to.$$I'm probably the least fit around. My idea of exercise is walking my dogs or Pokemon-ing. Hahaha. Winning the Misfit watch would help keep tabs on my activities, and maybe make me more conscious on moving more.$$Liked and shared! Hopeful to win because I haven't found a fitness tracker that's versatile enough for different occasions until this. And I've been thinking of getting one to monitor my sleep due to my shift work. Plus it's gonna motivate me to move around more to increase my activity level since work is office based and I've been procrastinating on exercising.$$Liked and shared because I love to eat and I eat anything and everything as Long it fits my calorie intake daily. Thing is, I never knew the calorie count for Singapore food which amazes me that you guys are able to find out! The best thing is there are macro nutrients, aka, fat, carbs and proteins. That will definitely be better. I wanna win because I seldom have pretty clothes at the gym so let me stand out a little. üôÉüôÇ$$Liked and Shared! Being a new mother of a 3 month old, it's tough breastfeeding, keeping count of the calories you take in because yours always hungry and exercising! One of the toughest thing is ensuring I lose my pregnancy weight and yet be able to provide my son with the best and most nutritious breast milk! Getting a fitness tracker will definitely help me keep focused, motivated and of course keep track of my intake and exercise! I hope to win this fitness tracker to kick start my healthy pregnancy weight lose regime! :)$$I've always had issues with body image issues and I started out as a fat kid who was always bullied in school because I loved to snack and McDonald's was always my go to. Came February this year and I started being a control freak and limiting my food portion to 1 meal a day and sometimes I struggle to complete it because I was told I needed to lose weight and I wasn't good enough. Now I'm in in a better state and definitely happier and the fitness tracker will definitely aid me in achieving my fitness goals. After all its about being healthy and happy (:$$I'm super lazy at heading out for a walk and Jun Jie knows it best. With the fitness tracker, he can set a target for me to hit every week and motivate me to get out of my house and go for a walk or a run.$$Liked n shared
Since NS days, my weight is a healthy 60kg. Now my weight has ballooned to 80kg. I feel weak, sluggish and no confident. I hope that this tracker can be a reminder to lose weight be healthy. Walking is a simple and effective exercise.
Tan Bee Leng$$I should win as I don't have an activity tracker. I can only roughly track the calories I take daily via googling but I couldn't track the calories burnt. So scared only have in and no out. Wish dearly to own one activity tracker...
Liked and shared.$$Liked and shared. I hope to win Misfit fitness trackers so that I can work on my fitness. My fitness goal is to complete 2.4 km run within 12 mins, that is, 400 m within 2 mins. The fitness trackers will help me track my progress so that I can evaluate and plan my fitness routine.$$Liked and shared this post.I'm a food lover. Hence, is not so easy to maintain a good health. It will be wonderful if I could win Misfit Shine 2. This will help me to maintain my health and keep the doctor away.$$I'm hungry all the time, when I see this tracker on my wrist, I will know how far I came and I will feel guilty if I eat too much. This keeps me on track and helps to lose weight.$$The reason why I would like to win is this. Over the past few years, I've always been eating a lot, like really a lot. Being a 19 year old teenager, you would know how big of an appetite a person would have at this age, where it is a growing up stage, much food is needed. I'm constantly hungry, always upsizing my portion, always eating extras, always having that tea break & supper which is fattening like MCD? Or desserts??? that I probably shouldn't have. End result? Belly fats! Face became much rounder! Do I exercise? Nope, procrastination got the better of me, constantly finding excuses, rather eat & sleep and continue my sedentary lifestyle than to go out there to exercise. It was not until recently that I finally reflect on my actions, I calculated my BMI & I realized that I have to lose 5-8 kg in order to safely stay in the healthy range & not deviate towards the overweight category. For the past few weeks, I've been exercising & hitting the gym for 8 days consecutively now. Of course, my diet is still the biggest struggle to me because every where you go is just food, food and more food right so tell me, how to give up omg. But for the sake of my health, I've already plan this goal of mine, and I'll stick to it. I'll only have 3 meals each day, and stop upsizing my portion. If I feel the need to eat, I can have almonds in between meals, so as to fight the hunger pangs & besides almonds help in weight loss. I'll also hit the gym at least 3-4 times per week, because exercise paired with diet will help me in losing weight faster. 
Of course, diet plays the biggest part because you can exercise but you can also eat and you would need to exercise much longer in order to burn those calories you've consumed. Just as shown those desserts so much calories omg. 
I've been doing research here & there and of course action speaks louder than words. My goal is simple, to lose 5 kg before 2017. What the mind can conceive, it can achieve. :) so definitely, I hope that this fitness tool will further motivate me. Nothing is impossible. I'm possible :) cheers.$$I would want to win the Misfit Shine 2 to help me track my activities and be healthy. So that I can continue to enjoy in my indulgence and still be able to fit into my clothes.$$Liked and instantly shared!!!

I wanna win the fitness tracker because danggg the holidays has overtook my entire body. When bored I eat, go out with friends also eat, after working out go cafe eat again. I need my discipline back!!! Somemore next holiday gonna go vacay, need beach bod (kidding) üòÇ but really, desperate times calls for desperate measures. Halpppp!! :'($$I want to win because I love desserts too much but cannot desert my weight loss goal; having my own Misfit Shine 2 will motivate me to transform into Miss Fit! üòä

Haha, anyway my take is their wings are good. Unique texture, taste and crunch. but as for their F&C, i'm wondering if they are using Cod fish, (used traditionally for its texture and quality) or sutchi fish(aka catfish)? There's a difference in terms of taste and value for money.

Cat fish usually not the best choice because of origin of breed and also alot of western food stall use them because its super cheap. Most catfish are frozen so its unlikely to be fresh. Go NTUC and see how much one 500g packet cost, and you be surprise at how much you pay for 2 pcs of fish at that price u pay.

Widely recognized as the 'Indian System of Medicine', these branches of science focus on achieving overall health and wellness in humans, having been used successfully for centuries to treat various diseases. Among these traditional medicine systems, Yoga is the science of achieving absolute union with the divine and 'Tantra' is a way of controlling the energy that makes the ultimate union with truth, possible.

The Korea Tourism Organization announced on Tuesday the new tagline ‚ÄúImagine your Korea‚Äù to replace the short-lived slogans ‚ÄúDynamic Korea‚Äù and ‚ÄúSparkling Korea.‚Äù While the former slog‚Ä¶,"I think you should use Facebook more to trial something new and to gauge opinion, rather than ask afterwards. This looks like it has been created on Microsoft word.... Also, 'imagine' isn't best word that could have been chosen. I agree with the above...'discover' is much better.$$Not sure.. it implies every person can imagine or have an ideal Korea the way they'd wanted it to be which may differ from reality.. I rather the word DISCOVER which invites to see and experience Korea through someone's own eyes.$$too simple. if i were a designer, i
prefer to make logo with brush (Î∂ì) to show sort of lightness and freedom like wing,
cuz what the word 'imagine' profoundly means and makes reciever think of it ..
moreover about the text: don't let them just'imagine' but carve in their mind of certain image.
it'll be much more important to discuss of what Korea can appeal.$$I entered that contest too and I'm a bit dissapointed about the new logo, I think it looks too bold :( That was my Application:$$Lol! .....I imagine a Korea where people are not racist , where foreigners get equal rights and opportunities and where big conglomerates don't exploit  international students(that are recruited) by cutting on their pay check and benefits while making them work long hours at the office. That would make the slogan "" Imagine your Korea "" :P Korea Tourism Organizationimagine >> reality$$Honestly, it does nothing to get me excited about Korea. Also it seems like it's aimed more at the domestic Korean tourist market than foreigners. Korea has so much natural beauty, history, culture and food...........this is what people want to see and experience. KPOP and Korean drama's are good and all, but show what the real Korea is about.$$Its nice..but how can you promote that much..your consulate in the philippines is very oppressive...there are about 800 delegates from philippines for a convention in seoul this september..but most of filipino delegates were denied of visa...most of the delegates had been to europe and australia but denied in korea. There are also delegates from US and from europe..what can also the organizer think? that convention is a tourism privilege for korea.$$This logo don't show us culture and traditions$$Neither  the logo and nor the slogan are eye catching or memorable.$$Let a great graphic artist have her free reign in creating a beautiful and effective design.  This is terrible.$$Sounds a bit strange... because nobody would say a sentence like ""imagine your..."". Not impacting enough... sounds like a typical korean slogan; which usually is put together using random english words :) i still love korea though!$$""Imagine your Korea?"" What is that supposed to mean..?$$You have good tourism fair..but in other hand ita unfair$$Not good. ""Imagine"" not match for tourism sector :) *just2cent*$$Hem.. I Love the new slogan but not the logo.. Sorry but it looks rigid...$$I want to go to Corea. It's my dream$$I see it as an invitation$$On IBuzz Korea they asked about the opinion, about that slogan, a few months ago. If I remember right.. I also think ""Imagine"" isn't really well chosen. One can also imagine bad things or things which are not true.$$Still not great. A lot of Westerners still don't really know enough about Korea before visiting here to ""imagine their own"" version of it.

Additionally, the Asahikawa Heiwa-dori Shopping Street in Asahikawa City, Hokkaido, introduced the new tax-free system on June 1, 2015. 
Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5,001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10,001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district.

For example, buy some Japanese teas, a kimono and anything else you fancy on the shopping street, and when you have finished shopping, just go to the tax refund counter in Seibu Department Store. Enjoy shopping at bargain prices, and take a little taste of Japan back home with you.

Asahikawa City has many other attractions besides shopping, and also a great destination for travelling. Please come and visit!

They are small, but does not mean they are ""easier"" to take care. 

If you do not intend to let your rabbit free roam or at least have a 3m by 3m playpen to house it, please do buy rabbits. They are indoor animals, not to be kept along the corridor to be exposed to rain and shine. 

They are domesticated. So do not bring them out like how you bring out dogs. They get stressed up very easily and may die from it. Once they stop eating or drinking for 24hours, they may die from gut stasis, which is VERY common for rabbits. 

Please, do not get any animals to teach yourself or your family member on being ""responsible"". No lives is too insignificant to be cherished for.$$While I can see that this is an advertorial post 'brought to you by Rabbit Headquarters', it seems like only one surface was scratched by this article. What it lacks to provide a wholesome view, is the position of animal welfare groups such as SPCA Singapore, House Rabbit Society Singapore (HRSS) and Bunny Wonderland that actually rescued rabbits that were bought by petshop patrons and then surrendered. Some of them were severely neglected because they were bought as toys and not as living things. These rescues nurse them back to health and help them to find a new home, without monetary gain. Hopefully Singapore readers will realize there is always 2 sides to a coin and make a more educational decision to do what is right. And until there is no rabbit to be adopted in these shelters, then I will feel it is right to buy a rabbit produced just for you by petshops.$$I think you need to publish about rabbit SHELTERS rather than a wannabe HQ that does not save abandoned rabbits. Money for you is one thing, doing the right thing is another.$$Please consider adopting a pet bunny from House Rabbit Society Singapore (HRSS) or Bunny Wonderland instead.

Verdict:
While the food is nothing to rave about, it‚Äôs passable considering people generally visit character cafes for the ambience and aesthetic, rather than to indulge in a gastronomic experience. We fell in love with the beautiful decor and how its open 24 hours a day. Imagine bringing your partner here for a surprise midnight tea date! 

Hello Kitty Orchid Garden succeeds in creating a unique experience for all Hello Kitty fans, both local or overseas.

The streets & rivers were narrowed down. Trees were hugely reduced because of population and over developments. If Manila structures base their building designs like of the era gone by, Manila could have a distinct character for foreigners and locals alike to marvel.  Money is not the problem because the businessmen have money.  If the Europeans, Americans and our neighboring Asian countries can do it, why can't we?$$Twy, sometimes I wish I lived there and other times I'm glad I don't.$$ Of course, most Filipinos should know what happened to Bonifacio. Aguinaldo‚Äôs men raped Bonifacio‚Äôs wife and stabbed Bonifacio. Eventually, they executed him and buried him in Maragondon, Cavite.

Today, the illuminati, or at least part of its principles, is still alive in government. For instance, Benigno Aquino, Sr, the grandfather of Noynoy, and President Manuel Roxas, the grandfather of Mar, were both well-known Freemasons. Noy is still fighting the Church, and he is still making the same mistake as Aguinaldo who asked assistance from American illuminati who will betray Noy in the end. ",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The tradition of the kalesa (horse-drawn carriage), was brought to the Philippines by Spaniards in the 18th century. They were originally reserved for nobles and the power elite, but are now commonly used on tours of the historic Intramuros district.

Fun Fact:
Very close to Intramuros and a must-see for all tourists is the Binondo Chinatown -- the oldest Chinatown in the world, established in 1594.

Offers its program to eliminate the surface and underground earthquakes, stopping forest fires, forest conservation, and restoration of water balance of Indonesia.
Restoring the first option - reducing the number and power of earthquakes.
Forest fire prevention and forest restoration.
Restoration of water balance of Indonesia.
The first earthquake. This is a very serious work, and it may seem impossible. It is not correct and effective solutions there. Quote: ""Indonesia is one of the most seismically active zone of the planet and is part of the"" Pacific Ring of Fire ""- a powerful tectonic break. Annually seismologists recorded in Indonesia around 7000 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0 on the Richter scale. ""
Is it possible to reduce the number of earthquakes in Indonesia and to reduce their power?
Can.
Mountain formation, adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates were many thousands of years before the warming in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. Take two bricks to hold them together metal strip, and will be heated. According to the law: solid body expands when heated, bricks expand and collapse. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And there are, or smaller joints in Indonesia and around - many thousands.
Treatment of the first stage. Cooling sushi Indonesia, and water in the surrounding seas. Terms reduce the amount of power and ground and underground earthquake and tsunami - at 15% per year. The second and third stages will give later.
Second. Termination of forest fires due to litter moisture: dry last year's grass, fallen leaves, dead twigs, and the restoration of forest coolness and dampness. And much more.
Third. Restoration of water balance. This is the standard work on the production of drinking and irrigation water, but without it the temperature rise and evaporation impossible to do. Emphasizing that crystal clear drinking water will provide hospitals, schools, pre-schools in the big cities. Clean water will ensure growth in its net production to tourist facilities, and will provide a significant increase in the inflow of tourists.
Such proposals, Indonesia will not get from anyone, and all the disasters will increase and the number and power, and destroy the economy.
Visas to Indonesia me or managers are not needed. Better to call me as a specialist for three months. During that time I, or one of the managers of our bearings, and someone left who - no, but a visa is not the main thing.

Read his straightforward, honest assessment of the country and let us know your thoughts! 

http://www.idreamedofthis.com/2013/11/27/what-i-really-think-of-the-philippines/Heartfelt (and hilarious) observations after living in the Philippines for a year.","I'm not confused. I love it here, retired in Cebu for a year & half now, did take me a while to just slow down after 35 years in San Francisco Bay Area, have been all over Cebu Bohol Negros Oriental and the best Palawan. Yes poverty is pervasive but the Filopino people are the friendliest most humble on the planet.$$Wonderful article and very honest about these remarkable people. I have been blessed to have married a beautiful Phillipino women ha and family. She is an incredible wife. I plan on retirement in the fils. Slow my life down and love and support my aswa with all my heart.$$I've been to Manila and Cebu. I loved them both and especially fell in love with the joy of the people who live here. üòç$$This is just garbage written by a woolly-brained American liberal wracked with misplaced white guilt. The Philippines is fine. Happiness isn't about material wealth at all--though wealth is great! 

And the wonderful thing is, the economy in the Philippines is about to boom. Many many people are going to experience so many good things very soon there. They have finally solved the only real problem they ever had: Corrupt thieves posing as politicians.$$I've also been there for a month living with the people living in the privince and witnessed some city boys and girls begging for money on every corner in the cites. Yes people in the province were different. I heard they emphasize happiness over financial richness several times. Meanwhile I got some chances to talk privately with the young girls (not the boys) then I noticed some different inner sides and desires. They mostly said that they wanted to live in a bigger house and hoped that they would be able to go abroad to live a richer life with modern environment. Briefly speaking they said they want to live in a more modern style than now. Of course they said they are happy with the current life with their family members and relatives but deep inside I found that they yearn for some different lives as in the TV dramas or in some films. Happiness is indeed something relative. If the girls hadn't seen any more developed coutries and lives first or secondhand they would be perfectly content with their recent lives. But the opposite is the case for those girls living in the 21th century. I come to an conclusion which is half subjective and half objective that people in PH have two inner sides in one of which they are really happy despite of lack of money and in another they hope for a better more modern life now.$$This is just purely an opinion from a foreigner who is just merely comparing Phil and his home country- just his personal unsolicited observation. In anyway doesn't represent the Filipino culture as a whole. Indeed Westerners have high standard of living but working at least 16 hrs a day with two or three different jobs just to be able to pay their taxes, bills and credit cards for a lifetime!!! I still choose the Filipino way.$$Was in the Philippines two times now. Loved it and plan to come back. Have friends there and i see how hard their life is! As in any country in the world there is light and darkness....till now i had no bad experiences and hope the next trip will be as wonderful as before. Im thankful to read about other peoples trips and how they see things. Looking forword to go back and see more places!$$Thank you for being true in your observation and expressing your feelings about our country and I'm glad you saw the good and bad side of it with an open mind and an open heart....I applaud you for your post and you are more than welcome to come and visit our beautiful country again and again...God Speed$$I've been to Philippines two times now. I love it! I'm married to Filipina and one day would love to retire there. Very good article!$$The Philippines is my most favourite destination. The beauty of Bohol and friendly people makes me excited to come back soon. I have also encouraged my friends not to look past it with so much to explore, but no balut for me !!!$$Nice, honest and candid of Mr Allen's stay in the Phil. 

Thank you for both the great and challenging stories you shares. Visit Phil again. 

Ps: this article was written three years ago.$$Nathan Allen is like Kyle Jennermann or more popularly known as ""Kulas"" who's a Canadian and loves it in the Philippines so much. Thank you guys for loving my country!$$I pretty much agree with you, on everything. Even though,  I've been going to the Philippines for the last 10 years, and my wife is from Luzon, I really enjoy the warmth of the Filipinos!
They are all about family, which, as Americans we have seemed to have forgotten, this.

Teary eyed when done. Tsada magpuyo dri no? Salamat sa pag appreciate sa Pilipinas. God bless you more. Take care always.$$The parts about America are somewhat true. I never felt I needed to buy a Starbucks to fit in, maybe I am different but if you can't afford it then don't buy it. Many Americans agree with me and don't feel pressure like this author feels. If you don't want it don't buy it.$$This guy really doesn't understand piany, he judges from a perspective of America, and mo own experience's there seeing poverty, seeing  poor helping the poor, and people with job's help as well, hindi one can judge a country from a year!

http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20151208-smile-youre-in-asias-friendliest-metropolisDinner in Manila or cocktails in Makati. Why you should do business here.","I've just visited Manila last 3 weeks, and I almost agree with this article.  By showing their politeness everywhere, especially when you go across the street and get the invitation from driver, the Philippino's behaviours actually inspired us so much when I came back to my country. I definitely will come back Philippin for another trip. And I suggest that you should come here at least one time in your life and get your own evaluation. Every judgement on paper is only for references.$$Ella May Agustin it says, The first thing you‚Äôll notice about Manila are the stares you attract from locals. No one grows up in this city being told that it‚Äôs impolite to stare, so the habit has just stuck. Don‚Äôt worry, these are just curious glances and the only response is a friendly smile.$$It is said friendliest NOT safest...which is means the true nature of legitimate productive individual of a certain area (manila /manile√±os). There are bad elements everywhere and there are certain areas (locals and internationals) that are not that friendly. 
Not all legitimate manile√±os lives in manila anymore ...so one may encounter the wrong people.
It is said ""walang tao na nagkakalat sa sariling bakod"".
Manila had been flocked by local and international tourist. Legitimate manile√±os welcome them with open arms and later abused their hospitality and enviroment. Some manile√±os were forced in anyways to live outside their domain.$$Lets be honest, Manila is not tourist friendly with all those snatcher, pick pocket and other scammers roaming around the street of Manila looking for the next victim.$$Yes friendly people but also the most rude people of any country I have been. And Manila? What a joke.$$Ah well I still think it's a lovely place and yes I have had the taxi driver experience except my Filipino partner saved me. Like any city you always need to be careful. Never been pick pocketed in Manila or anywhere in the Asia but have been in London England!üò°$$To my mind taxi drivers are to foreigners the unofficial ambassadors of any capital city.
The way the majority of Manila taxi drivers have behaved over the Christmas period is nothing short of a disgrace.
You have a long way to go before you can truly be regarded as the friendliest to foreign visitors.$$Even my Philipino friends avoid Manila when possible and I don't think Manila is a good advert for the rest of the country, which is beautiful. My experiences of Manila are unfortunately all bad. Out of there as quickly as possible and head to other places asap :)$$Thank you for sharing this. As a Filipino, I would definitely prefer to spread news around the world that we are a nation with goodness. We offer the best hospitality service in the world and we have a lot more to offer. With a growing tourism industry, we need to help with the promotion by simply asking our fellow colleagues to come and experience it for themselves simply by sharing news such as this. I KNOW we have issues that are yet to be dealt or currently being and I DO ACKNOWLEDGE that...but c'mon mga Pinoy and Pinay: is it so hard to share something good about our country?

Merry Christmas and an advance Happy New Year to all!$$Those who had bad experiences, (patawad) sorry. My personal appologies. You went to the wrong places. Philippines is generally a peaceful, friendly country. Im speaking in behalf of the multitude of Filipinos who strive to be good. We own it up. But we are up for the change. We are almost there. Thank you for coming and please arrange your next visit. Change is at hand.#duterte2016$$But the overcrowded place is  Manila hhahaha...$$Oh Manila is not Philippines.  Get over it. Have you been to other cities outside manila.. people can be so negative
. New York can be filthy and dirty to me if your brain is working all right.$$PROUD TO BE FILIPINO! ASHAMED OF OUR GOVERNMENT SYSTEM!$$I don't generalize there are good and bad people every where not only  in Manila. Philppines is a beautiful country that's for sure but province life is the best$$hahahahaha   especially the taxi drivers ,,,,,$$what? friendliest? paki double check. I am not against it. I am actually happy but it was not friendly when I was still in the Philippines. (Terrible traffic, pollution (air, garbage, etc).$$Social engineering has done a marvelous job, based on the comments this post has garnered. This way of thinking degrades the thinker. Manila is unable to rise above such diatribes because its population has been steadily fed what is bad about it and not encouraged to overcome imperfection and strengthen what is good. Careful, a nation divided against itself easily falls.$$One of the most dangerous city in the world. One of the most  corrupt  country in the world .

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one üòÇüòÇ damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london üòçüòç my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it üòÇ$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin ‚Äì Singapore‚Äôs 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy! It's the most unforgettable dining moment.$$There's this place where you pick what food you want, and it get delivered to you like a speed train on a conveyor belt after the chef has finished your order.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

#DiscoverWonderfulIndonesia ","Taman Sari also known as Taman Sari Water Castle is a site of a former royal garden of the Sultanate of Yogyakarta. It is located about 2 km south within the grounds of the Kraton, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Built in mid 18th century, the Taman Sari had multiple functions, such as a resting area, a workshop, a meditation area, a defense area, and a hiding place.

Taman Sari consisted of four distinct areas: a large artificial lake with islands and pavilions located in the west, a bathing complex in the centre, a complex of pavilions and pools in the south, and a smaller lake in the east. Today only the central bathing complex is well preserved, while the other areas have been largely occupied by the Kampung Taman settlement.

Since 1995 the Yogyakarta Palace Complex including Taman Sari is listed as a tentative World Heritage Site.$$Taman Sari comes from the Javanese words, where ""taman"" is garden and ""sari"" means beautiful, Beautiful Garden. Haven't been there yet, but will visit Jogja again! ‚ô°‚ô°$$The name Taman Sari comes from the Javanese words Taman, meaning a ""garden"" or ""park"" and Sari, which means ""beautiful"" or ""flowers"".

https://zula.sg/singaporean-guys-cheated/","From my experiences most sg ladies are just playing hard to get. To them sincerity and a true heart ranks second to money and status. 

They are never satisfied with their other half. Constantly comparing their own partner with their friends's. When they see their girlfriends doing well and being constantly pampered by their bfs, they feel super envious and expect no less for themselves.

And when they realized that they could no longer feel good among their fellow girlfriends, they would have a change of heart easily. They could never take abit of hardship and would just ""abandon ship"" when storms come. In short they could never stand by their man. 

Materialism and hankering a life of pampering and comfort is the cause of it all. Its sad. For some of them they will always wonder why they always can't have / sustain a relationship but they would never look at the mirror and ask themselves :""So am I the cause and problem?""$$Basically these guys just go for the girls' looks mostly  so I think they deserve to get their hearts broken.  If they had really looked carefully and got to know the girls well, they would know who are the fakes and those who are really worth their time. So go figure.$$Really good hearted girls may not look like a million dollars all the time because most of them are busy earning their own salaries and taking care of their aged parents.  But once they get committed, they sacrifice their love, time and money nurturing that relationship. So those guys who only look for appearances   I still think they deserve the ""superficial"" girls that come with high maintenance and a truckload of  complaints ! :) haha$$The thing is a guy gets labelled an asshole when he cheats.

Dyed into a natural green colour from the juice of pandan (screwpine) leaves.

Our friends The MeatMen show you how these gula melaka bombs will have you going for more once you have your first!

Full Ondeh ondeh recipe: http://themeatmen.sg/ondeh-ondeh/ ","This is Indonesia traditional dessert called ""klepon"".
Onde2 uses the same glutinous rice fluor, filling with mung bean paste and covered with sesame. Klepon and Onde2 are both traditional dessert of Indonesia$$I love this kuih onde onde or gula Melaka . I noticed in every Asian countries I went to there are similarities in food for example this also you can found in Vietnam but they call it differently so why must you argue where it's originated? We are all came from the same root/ region and sharing nearly the same type of food and even some have similarities in culture. Let's enjoy the food that bring people together.$$THANK YOU for saying the name right. And yes. it's a Malay kueh.$$this is basically same like tangyuen, but we use pandan leaves as flavoring and coated em with the coconut :3 Kim Yean$$Great. We're sharing a wonder recipe for everyone to enjoy and some arsehole trolls decided to come and claim this and that.  Only insecure people needs to claim this and that. The rest enjoys it the same regardless of origin.$$I'm so sick of ppl fighting about what is the real name of this kuih and the origin. Like seriously? Don't you guys have any other important issue to be think of?! Gosh. Just enjoy the food. Even in malaysia they are some ppl who call it onde2 and some call it gula melaka. But we never fight about what is the real name because we just enjoy th food. Get a life.$$This is in indonesia this name KLEPON$$Malaysia always claim something from Indonesia, can't you be more creative with your own thing? Thank you$$Every time I come back to Singapore, I have to go hunting for these.  The lil' neighbourhood Malay kueh stalls and that special, lovingly-homemade taste seems to be in short supply.$$Omg this is one of our fav!
Why everybody arguing abt this?
Asian singapore malay malaysia malay indonesia have very similar food history bcos we're all rojak! (What is not the same is country history) The malays here are javanese mix bawean mix bugis mix and we are all malay üòë$$Thank you for your recipe. Your recipe is highly reliable. May I ask if I would like to tweak that by using sweet potato, what's the sweet potato to
Flour ratio?$$Thumbs up for people who came here to see some yummy onde-onde/ondeh-ondeh or however ur country calls it as in the making process to entertain our saliva and not caring about it's origin just that it's an Asian delicacy$$Why are people fighting over who's dessert is this? At the end of the day, we all came from the same ""rumpun"" aka roots.. It's just food anyway. I'd be glad to know if I can find food/deserts that I love in various parts of the world..$$......yeah, I know it 's yummy....did that once in a  blue moon....using pandan leaves is the best ...nothing can beat the original flavour n aroma....Long live pandan leaf...!!!!...<3$$Gayle Lim is this the recipe you're planning to follow? I don't even eat this back home but I craving now hahahaha it's like tang yuan with sugar filling and coconut outside like that$$I don't care about the name, I just want to eat. If I say ondeonde and am met with blank stares, I just point to it and say ""that one"" and I still get to eat it. Who cares as long as it goes into the mouth? If it's different then I got to try something else, all the merrier.

Anyway this is a Singapore page so this food is known as onde-onde here. Just like we call roti prata here and not roti chennai. Peace.$$Actually as know this kuih is nyonya melaka. Those days wen m small only chinese aunties at my village sold during morning market. Talking about 45 years ago.$$I heard some people put a lil bit of salt in the coconut so the onde onde will be a lil salty outside n sweet inside.$$Actually gula anau is the best and the taste is slightly different from gula melaka..but gula melaka is commonly used for onde2..and that's why gula anau is slightly expensive than gula melaka bcause it is made from pokok anau..I love onde2 üòã$$Good to steam the fresh coconut for 15-20 min with a pinch of salt. Helps coconut from spoiling too quickly.$$Jamil Adams omg I learnt how to make this in boarding! But Miss taught us with green food colouring üòÇüòÇüòÇ and we all added too much sugar it exploded but it was so cool tho cause we got to make it into different shapes!

It is located halfway through Panglao along its coast facing the Bohol Sea. It is a sprawling property which covers 16 hectares. The topography of the resort is diverse. It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view.

I think the organizers want to help foreign ppl buy tickets but don't have the manpower or foreign language abiltity (usually concert organizers dont even seem to consider overseas guests), so they contacted agencies abroad, and those agencies are selling for a profit at market price.
