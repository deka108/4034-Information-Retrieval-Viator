Coimbatore, an ancient city, was the capital of a small tribal village, Kongunad, before the 2nd century AD until it was brought under Chola control in the 2nd-3rd centuries AD by Karikalan, the first of the early Cholas. 

Among its other great rulers were the Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas, Pandyas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara kings. When Kongunad fell to the British along with the rest of the state, its name was changed to Coimbatore. 

Today, Coimbatore (Kovai in Tamil) is a commercial city of considerable importance; it is home to over 60 spinning and weaving mills and textiles is its main industry. It is also well known for motor sports with regular events being held at the Kari Motor Speedway.

This blog has probably captured the true description of this culinary center yet often misunderstood people& province. I only got to taste authentic homegrown kapampangan cooking when I got invited to a wedding in a barrio in Arayat. It was lavish for a barrio wedding with everyone helping in. And all the foods were truly the famous cabalen home cooking I've been hearing of. I specially liked the sweet adobo meat & when they told me it's a dog, I turned my eyes on the duck, prawn and pork menus.haha. We dipped in the cold springs of Mt.Arayat. For me, that wedding was the focal point of my Pampanga sojourn.$$Yes, it is very true that
""Kapampangans are deeply religious which, of course, is not the same as spiritual. Their fetish for anitos (spirit idols) has morphed into an excessive, almost irrational, devotion to anything associated with their colonizers’ religion. Kapampangans have found their new idols on which to lavish their affections: the church temple for which they’d spend any amount to build, rebuild and renovate; the retablos and santos (altars and icons) which they over-decorate, over-dress, and over-process; and of course their priests whom they over-revere to the point of electing one as governor.""

The many details enumerated above made Bro Eli Soriano, who is not a Kapampangan, stay in this province and dare to focus his efforts to preach the Biblical Gospel of Christ, even if the teachings of our Lord and Saviour that he trumpets are often the exact opposite to the idolatrous Catholic teachings given to the local populace.

The ADD Convention Center was later built in Apalit to continue the banner television and radio program named Ang Dating Daan, and with the mercy and grace of God, thousands of Kapampangans have left the catholic faith and joined the 100% Bible-based Church of God.

What is it?
Funny how a dive site that has the Tagalog word of garbage for its name is one of the best dive spots in Anilao. A lot of interesting creatures can be spotted in Basura — octopuses, seahorses, tiny frogfishes, ghost pipefish, and tiny shrimps. This area is classified as a muck dive site, hiding all those species under a viscous sea of mud. Come to think of it, the name's making a little more sense now.

Fun Fact:

Good luck everyone! ","My ideal getaway will be escaping to Japan! It's a great way to relax and find your zen while traveling to places you've never been to. Exploring Japan and learning new cultures will be the perfect CNY getaway. A great way to start a new year~$$My ideal getaway is to go to korea with my BFFs! We have been planning this trip for years but hadn't make our first move to book the tickets, so these credits would definitely help us realize our getaway! Tan Ying Bei Natassja Putri$$Hello klook! My ideal get away plan would be one that is affordable, with plenty of good deals and cheap thrills. Im all for value for money deals! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 This would probably be a free & easy trip to somewhere with sand dunes, camels, beautiful sunsets, wonders of natural, with the companion of my love ones❤️$$My ideal plan is.... grabbing a couple of clothes, throwing them into a bag pack and off we (what's a trip without buddies?) go. Then it's just hitting the spots that locals recommend. Nothing says adventure more than spontaneity! 🙌🏻$$My ideal getaway plan is something impromptu to a place  closer to Nature where I can put away my phone and just relax. No social media, no calls, no stress from work. Local food, local people and local culture!

I only like visited my family twice a year.. and cny is the only time i can visit all my family members but me as a student cant afford the ticket. Hope can get it.. 🙏🏻$$I watched a documentary about a guy walking the Himalayas and thought that will be cool to do - passing through several countries albeit it being dangerous. 

I digress but i think my ideal getaway is being able to try things I haven't tried, that being having a homestay with a nomadic family in Mongolia - helping a nomadic family to migrate, building ger, waking up to be greeted by endless colourful mountains, meeting eagle hunters.

I may not walk the Himalayas but I hope I will have other experiences to make up for it$$It's been barely a month into 2017, but it already feels like I've worked through the entire year. A quiet resort by the beach, coupled with the calming sea breeze and the sound of waves crashing onto the shore. Something to recharge and rethink what the future holds. A trip to clear minds and take a leap of faith into unknown waters, deciding whether to leave behind what shouldn't be held onto.$$My ideal getaway plan is to shop and eat freely. Like honestly, when's the last time anyone's able to let go and just be yourself and not be judged and hounded. Being yourself is fantastic!

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Tagbilaran.

Or take the Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry from Cebu to Tagbilaran.

this is totally the camera for me. I've been eyeing a flip screen camera for so long. with this camera, there will no longer be failed selfies, cutting off faces or wrong positioning. IT WILL ALWAYS BE PICTURE PERFECT <3

thank you TheSmartLocal for sharing this awesome post! love your other food and travel posts as well.$$Taking photos is what I usually do during the weekends when I'm out of camp. Dedicating photos to Instagram (@jonaskohh) and my personal blog (glimpsedthrough.blogspot.com), it can be a little troublesome to bring DSLR out and therefore Panasonic Lumix GF7 will solve the problem of bringing a bulky camera out during the weekends.

With the ability to pinpoint a subject with a touch of the screen and let the camera determine the correct focus and exposure, it definitely helps to take great Instagram photos or even photos to be uploaded onto my blog! 

With a build in wifi and providing easy connection, I can easily transfer photos from the camera to my phone and with that, I can upload them to Instagram right away! 

Apart from taking photos of still life, I will also take photos with my friends and with a 180 degrees tiltable monitor, selfies will definitely be a breeze!$$Dear TheSmartLocal.com!

I would like to own this cool Panasonic Singapore newest camera, Lumix GF7! Why? Reason is that simple!

Firstly, I love photography and it can be stress to take a nice photograph without a good camera that can focus my object well or the setting of the exposure can take sometime to adjust to the correct setting especially in our sunny Singapore!

With Lumix GF7, it can solve this problem for me! I simply need to pinpoint a subject which I want to capture by simply touch the screen and the camera will determine the correct focus and exposure or I just tap to take a photo without need to adjust anything!

What I like about this Lumix GF7 is that, I could wefie with my friend by selecting Selfie function! This camera in build 180 degree tiltable monitor where I can take photo with my best buddy by choosing Buddy Shutter or Face shutter! I think we will prefer the face shutter where we just need to cover our face with a waving hand to capture the photo!

Not to forget the coolest function will be Easy Wi-Fi!! Why? I can simply connect the camera or any of the smartphone or tablet and I can start sharing the photo images to my friend instantly and we could post to Instagram or Facebook immediately!

I will really love to own this camera!! :)

Thank you!$$Hello, I really want to win this so I'll give 3 key functions (maybe can increase my chances by 3 times)

I AM SOLD ALR!! I really hope I can win this!! I've been wanting to get a camera for myself since ages ago. However being a full time student means not being able to work and earn enough to get a new camera. Hence, I really hope that I'll be able to win this so I can capture pictures with my loved ones and upload it to social media. This camera would be perfect to capture pictures and memories with my mum and my dad and being able to print out a quality picture to hang up on our walls!! :) With a camera like this I'll be able to capture the happiest and most candid photos of my parents and surprise them with a photo album!! <3$$Here's three functions of the Lumix GF7 that impressed me and which I'm really keen about!

1) Built-in WiFi function (here's to uploading Instagram-worthy shots immediately after taking them)
2) 180 degrees tiltable screen (high quality selfies guaranteed)
3) Jump Snap function (by using your phone as a remote control, capturing good jump shots have never been easier!)

Hope that I can win the Lumix GF7 so that I can bring my Instagram photos (@raphaelhugh) to the next level! Won't need to rely solely on the iPhone 6 any longer haha. Thanks!$$I definitely would love to be the winner of the new Panasonic LUMIX GF7! 

Here are my reasons why (5 reasons in total...does this increase my chances?): 

1) it takes WONDERFUL photos in bad lighting (when I did my research I was pretty amazed by the photos that it was able to capture in different lighting conditions)

2) Wi-Fi connectivity!!! Say goodbye to the traditional and painful way of uploading photos on to Facebook/Instagram. In addition, it always takes pretty long for the photos to appear on fb due to laziness (we have been all there, haven't we?) Now, with wi-fi I can immediately share all my photos to Facebook and Instagram! What a dream! 😍

3) HIGH QUALITY SELFIE FUNCTION WITH AN 180 LCD TILT SCREEN PLUS BEAUTY FUNCTIONS!!!! MUST I SAY MORE?????? 

4) Interchangeable lenses *.* *.*

5) Did I mention that it LOOKS and FEELS incredible? Seek, classy and light. Just what I need. 

Best. Fashion. Accessory. Ever.$$1 Key function: 180° Tiltable Monitor for Selfie with Face Shutter & Buddy Shutter

Pardon the cheesy line, it's love at first sight! 😍 Really in love with its chic and stylish look which is like a classic camera. It will be the perfect companion on my cafe hopping adventures and my brother's (Weihong Peh) hunt for elusive places (which is the reason why I click on this post). Read reviews that it's easy to use (so not as intimating as a DSLR for an amateur photographer like me) but powerful. It's able to capture shots & colours under low lights, which is essential on my food hunts. Plus, I can now easily take selfies and wefies and upload it quickly with its inbuilt beauty and Wifi functions (yeah!). Most importantly, it's light! I can take LUMIX GF7 with me wherever I go and take shots single handedly. Awesome! 

I have trips with family and friends up coming. Will be perfect to have LUMIX GF7 with us to capture these memorable moments. Thank you @TheSmartLocal.com  for sharing this post and giveaway! Will really really love to win and own @Panasonic Singapore LUMIX GF7 please.$$Liked & Shared! <3

I'd love to win this camera for a lot of reasons but I'll just state one key reason as requested.

Thanks!$$I love the 180 degrees Tiltable Monitor which would allow me to take photos together with family and friends :) In addition, the Built-In WiFi would enable me to post photos on facebook and instagram without going through the trouble of transferring the photos onto my computer or phone first. Winning this camera would allow me to finally seriously pursue my interest in photography, which was always deterred by my lack of funds to purchase a quality camera or phone :( Thanks to TheSmartLocal.com and Panasonic Singapore for providing such an opportunity :)$$It has a motion activated shutter, 16 megapixels with the wide angle lens kit and even built-in wifi with easy connection! I'll be going on a school trip to Hong Kong in two weeks for 5 days and to the Philippines for a little more than a week shortly after that, and I'd love to document my trips without the hassle of having to film with my dslr which would be heavier and less compact.

The Simhastha Kumbh is an unrivalled celebration in India. The most popular legend regarding the origin of Kumbh Melas is the Samudra Manthan or 'churning of the ocean'. Gods and demons competed ¬ercely in the churning in search of the divine nectar of immortality. During this epic battle to capture the Urn (Kumbh) containing the nectar, drops of the precious liquid fell on four places – Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Nashik and Ujjain. Hence, river Kshipra became the enhancer of life and to celebrate this event since then the grand festival came in vogue. Kumbh Mela, is held once every twelve years at these four places and attracts millions of devotees.

Grand Simhastha, on the Ghats of the glorious Kshipra

The Ujjain Kumbh is celebrated when Jupiter ascends into sun sign Leo's quarter or the Simha constellation of zodiac, which is why it is called 'Simhastha'. The Simhastha is special in Ujjain as it is the seat of divine Mahakal - the Lord of all times. The ritual of bathing in the holy waters of Kshipra begins on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (March-April) and continues on various dates until the full moon shows up in the following month of Vaishakha.

Simhastha 2016 will begin on 22nd of April and will continue till 21st of May.

Sadhus of various sects from across the country assemble in Ujjain and mingle with ordinary people as they take their ritual dip in the holy waters of the Kshipra.!

If you can't use Google Maps to save your ass, Downtown Line 2 opening this December is just what you need. Here're 20 previously ulu places you can now explore with ease!

Thanks to Land Transport Authority – We Keep Your World Moving, we can now say goodbye to tiresome walks under the hot sun! 

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/downtown-lineWith Downtown Line 2 opening this December, here are 20 previously obscure places you can now explore with ease!","Hi. Please take your photo which shows hikers going through a tunnel down. You give the impression that the tunnel is part of a hiking trail. It is not! This is a biking trail and NOT open to hikers (per NPark's directives). Bikes come down the tunnels in speeds in excess of 30km/h and will not be able to take evasive action if there is a hiker there. Showing this photo gives the impression that hikers can use this part of the trial and this can potentially cause injuries to both hiker and biker.$$The pictures taken at the foot of the tunnel under the dairy farm trail section is not part of the ""Wallace trail"". This is part of the bukit timah mountain biking trail. Hiking is illegal and dangerous on all mountain biking trails. 

Posing at the foot of the tunnel seems picturesque. But please note that bikers will come down this slope from your back at high speeds. The transition from light to dark (in the tunnel) will make it difficult for bikers to see anybody standing in the middle of the trail.$$Nice, except that the ""tunnel"" is part of a mountain bike only trail. Bikers will be zooming downhill through that tunnel, not expecting walkers to be on the trail.$$I guess if you were on a bicycle or motorbike for years, you would have been to most of these places.  Regarding MTB trails, I give up, groups and clubs of people playing radio control cars in them. Making movies, standing in the middle of the trail chatting. Here's some advice: don't ever block a trail, if you need to stop or chat, move to the side or stay off the trail.  Get on a bike and go trail riding, you will understand what we mean.$$https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nparks.gov.sg%2F~%2Fmedia%2Fnparks-real-content%2Flearning%2Flearning-journeys%2Fguided-walks%2Fdiy-guided-walks%2Fancient-forest%2Fdiy-trail-guide.pdf%3Fla%3Den&h=xAQEkvCX9

You may not want to introduce your readers to somewhere which they will risk  getting themselves injured. As what some have already replied below, that section in your photo IS a mountain biking trail.

I sincerely hope your readers will be made aware of this. Thanks.$$Fuck off the places are going to lose their charm$$Dee King - trip to Praisehaven Family Megastore??$$New game has been released! Come and check it out on Google Play Store!

I will shop non-stop n eat all day ;) The weather is perfect all year, be it skiing, mountain climbing, cycling or sightseeing! Korea's transportation is first class and cost of living is affordable. Security is good too. It's seems that I am not tired of visit South Korea even though I have visited twice previously. Can't wait to get a chance to visit again if there is opportunity ^_^$$Korea has so many interesting places to visit, so many tasty foods to try, the korean people is so wonderful that it will be a dream to visit it. Wonderful Korea a country that everybody should visit at least one thousand times in its life.$$I want to go to Korea because i want to visit all of incredible World Heritages there. Splendid country with great culture, scenery, nature and people.$$I want to travel to Korea because I love Korea: the culture, food, dramas, songs, people, lifestyle, everything!!!$$I grew up with Korean friends and their Umma's fed me an abundance of Korean food growing up like 김밥, 김치, 라면 & 불고기 (My appetite is practically Korean), I've watched K-dramas growing up that were dubbed in Tagalog when I lived in the Philippines for 6 yrs. My friend's mothers always spoke about their culture and their homeland  and thought me some Korean and how to read & write a bit so much that since I was a wee little girl, Korea has always been on my top places to go visit. It would be nice to actually step foot in Korea and enjoy it myself. Food (street food & royal cuisine), See the palaces, sightsee, shopping (I love Korean skin care too) & Oppa 송중기 would be a dream come true but what I would cherish the most out of this trip would be to fully immerse myself in the culture, scenery and community in Korea and experience the beauty of the homeland of what the gracious Ummas talked about all these years. Hopefully I get that opportunity! 감사합니다! 😊$$Hi! I'm learning many things of that wonderful country (language, gastronomy, history, etc.) and it would be great to see in person the amazing things that South  Korea has! I really hope to be there one day 😍$$I'd like to go to Korea to enjoy the warm hospitality and kindheartedness of Korean people.$$Done! ~ Thank you KTO/Imagine Your Korea for this new online event. :-)$$I really want to go to Korea. The reason is because of Korea is a beautiful country. Of people its a fun and many great places to visit. I also enthusiasts music and Korean drama. it is a pride if I met one of the Idol Korea. In addition, I really want to school in Korea. Of the first, I was trying so that I can to Korea. But there is always a hitch. Hopefully, with this I can go to Korea.$$Never thought that I'd fall in love with korean dramas 'til I watched one of it two years ago. And I love it ever since. Watching the dramas led me to the famous Running Man. I always try my best not to miss any single episode. Lee kwang soo is my favorite. Since he is a best friend to song joong ki, he is my favorite as well. These are enough to make me dream that visiting korea one day would be amazing thing to happen in my life. Not only to witness its beauty but travel with joong ki is another fortune.$$Hello everyone! I badly want to go to korea eversince I'm 14. I studied well and because we had a problem about financial needs i only attended a vocational course. Fortunately, i've graduated. But that's not enough cos i'm always rejected whenever i applied for work(they want college level) My plan is to save money so i can go to my dreamland, korea. But i think it will never happen cos i'm completely broke and if ever i had money, i gave them all to my family. I badly want to go to korea because korean's tradition and cultures always amuses me. Their music, their foods, their mannerism, the way koreans talk. All! Always amazes me. Someday, i want to live in korea for good. But for now, if i will be picked in this trip to korea, i will be the Happiest girl in the world and it will give me more inspiration to my dream to live in korea. I cried once cos i'm making myself woke up in reality that i have no luck and will never have a chance to go there. I really really love that country so bad! I pray every night to our dear god that may he grant my dream to go to korea. thank you admins for this wonderful trip to korea idea.

Almost every word sounds weird from the local pronunciation..$$flour & flower have the same pronounciation, which u can find in dictionary. if u argue of having different dialect or way of pronounciation in different country, its not entirely wrong.$$http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tlsQrgBdDM$$1) Opinion seems to be divided on the pronunciation of “flour” in the British dictionaries I consulted. The Oxford Concise Dictionary (1995) and the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (2005) indicate that “flour” has the same pronunciation as “flower”, i.e.: 

 /’flau-e(r)/ – a two-syllabled word with the stress on the first syllable – the “e” is a schwa, like the ‘e’ sound in “moment”).  

However, the 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary (1989) and the online Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary show “flour” being pronounced as:  

 /flaue(r)/ – a one-syllabled word with three vowels together (a triphthong), the ‘e’ in it being also a schwa. Because of the combination of the three vowels in a syllable, we tend to glide over them, resulting in a sound resembling /fla(r)/.   

 I consider both pronunciations to be correct alternative pronunciations. In fact, there is also an alternative pronunciation of “flower”, indicated by the 20-volume OED, which is exactly like the second pronunciation of “flour”!$$Can blame Bon Jovi for mispronouncing ""prayer"".

Americans apparently pronounce ""algae"" as al-jai

Olango Islands, Cebu

What is it? 
This island group is composed of the main Olango Island and its six satellite islets. The site is a wildlife sanctuary that serves as a pit stop for migratory birds that come from as far as China, Japan and Siberia.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Fun Fact: 
The seven islands of the Olango group are joined together by a continuous reef. This makes the site a nice diving spot as well.

Om Beach, one of Gokarna’s five famed beaches, takes the shape of an “Om”, a Hindu spiritual symbol.

The other beaches, wedged between gigantic cliffs that protrude like delicate fingers into the sea, are Gokarna, Kudle, Half Moon, and Paradise. The drive up the winding path that leads to Gokarna is a scenic delight with rocky mountains and the Western Ghats on one side, and the Arabian Sea on the other.

When packing your bags for Boracay Island, shoes should be the least of your concerns. You'll be walking barefoot on the powder-fine sand most of the time. And sitting on it.

These are successful stories of our tourism frontliners who prove how inclusive the tourism industry can be. Their stories are told by various local travelers around the Philippines whose journey would not have been more fun and much easier without the help they got from their newfound friends.

This week, we begin with the story of Jacob Maentz (@jacob.maentz on Instagram), a documentary and travel photographer from Cebu:

""I met Captain Angel Torres in Bais Bay during an early morning excursion to see the dolphins of Tañon Strait. Tañon Strait lies between Negros Oriental and Cebu and is the largest protected seascape in the country. It is home to spinner dolphins, dwarf sperm whales, spotted dolphins and pygmy killer whales. Today, a number of fishermen and other locals work part-time as captains or crew for some 15 boat tours around Tañon Strait, Angel being one of them. Visitors can get a glimpse of the marine mammals during early morning dolphin-watching trips.

""Back in the early 90’s dolphin meat was sold for P10 per kilo and was a common part of the local diet. Marine species would also be hunted for pure sport, mainly because no one knew any better explained Angel. In the mid-1990’s much of that changed when the LGU implemented a number of environmental laws to protect the dolphins and whales in the area.  Tourism now provides a livelihood for local fishermen and the marine life is better protected. ""

So many good fodds there. Nom nom!! I love the wholesale there!! Can get some new products and they sells super creative and latest studds. Of course, I would like to visit Five Ram Statue in Yuexiu Park, Pearl River and White Cloud Mountain.

In life it's not where you go. It's who you travel with. My best travel kaki, Su Zen who has 80 percent same travel mindset and we accommodate each other another 20%!! Hope I can win this and our travel stories could be part of the TSL posts. AWESOME!$$#SCOOTWITHTSL because there are so many things to see, places to visit, food to try (i LOVE LOVE LOVE dim sum and Guangzhou is considered the birthplace of dim sum!) and adventures to be discovered in Guangzhou! I haven't been there before and have always been intrigued by this sprawling port city <3 Let's explore! Michelle Teo$$The Hai Di Lao queues are too long in Singapore. Hopefully it'll be shorter, faster and tastier over there in Guangzhou!$$Off to Guangzhou to seek an unexplored shopping paradise! Bangkok has been fun but I'm sure Guangzhou has just as much to offer! It will be nice to fly with scoot again, after the fantastic service they've provided for my trip to Bangkok in Jan (;$$I want to go to Guangzhou and continue my adventure for the Maritime Silk Road. I started the journey with my mum last year at Quanzhou to re-discover our heritage in order to learn more about ourselves. As our next pit stop in our adventure, we want to visit Guangzhou which is one of the most important ports in the Maritime Silk Road during Song and Tang dynasties. Besides discovering the region's history, culture, food, and people, we want to venture to the various historical sites such as the Temple of God of South Sea, the Muslim Sage's Tomb, and Hualin Temple. Hoping to win it and continue my journey on the Maritime Silk Road :)  #scootwithTSL$$This is too good to be true, flight tickets and all expenses?
I'll bring along Vera Sudianto , she's a big eater. I'll be in shopping paradise. Good for both of us!
Never been to Guangzhou, but I've some friends that were there to study back then, and seems they've so much fun! Affordable and good food they said, may Flyscoot and TSL make it happen, 2016! be my first trip to Guangzhou please! #scootwithTSL$$I would love to #scootwithTSL to Guangzhou as I have recently went to Beijing with my mum and loved how rich the culture over there is. From the old 四合院, magistrate's housing, exquisite details on buildings with hundreds of years history, it is a truly humbling experience. 
It has always been a wish to visit different parts of China & Guangzhou is one of the top on my list. 

Also, I have heard of all the nice food over at Guangzhou & my classmate who is a Shanghainese has been trying to get me to go together, promising me an experience I would never forget, which makes me even more excited on what would I be able to experience over at Guang Zhou!
My love for traveling has brought me to multiple places all over SEA, and I hope to be able to check the box beside GuangZhou too!$$I'll like to go Guangzhou with Alan Tan simply bcos we have not been there before and we've heard so much bout the wholesale markets and shorter Haidilao queue! :) 

Exploring a new country is always a learning experience for the both of us and being budget travel junkies ourselves, we hope to add Guangzhou to our list of destinations travelled! #ScootwithTSL$$I've never been to Guangzhou and so far haven't had the chance to until i saw this giveaway post from TSL. To be honest, Guangzhou has never come into my mind until this post and now it has gained my interest to visit this place. Would definitely love to visit it together with the TSL host, if i have the opportunity. I believe it will also be a good opportunity for me to know more about this place. :)$$WOW Guangzhou!? I wanna #scootwithTSL there with my best friend Min Lin! Lately, she has been caught up in tracing her Cantonese heritage and even signed up for Cantonese culture/dialect classes! This would be a brilliant opportunity for her!! 

Plus we're both geographers trained in urban studies and endlessly fascinated by the urban landscape of China which desires to be trendy yet maintains its rich heritage and culture. Guangzhou is a really a special city - a world class vibrant metropolis sitting beside the calming yet spectacular Baiyun mountain! 

Sans the geeky obsessions with cities and landscapes, we are two super outgoing & fun loving best friends who love capturing beautiful moments, savouring yummy food (omg DIMSUM!!!!) and enjoying wild adventures + exciting nightlife. & of course, girls will be girls... Shopping haven!!! 😍 The city of Guangzhou bodes an exciting new space of experience for us both!!

-(A)good break I need from life and all the lemons thrown at me

omg I didn't realise I spelt the word GUANGZHOU out as part of my post! Thanks TSL.$$I wish to be chosen so to be able to #scootwithTSL! Other than the urban side of Guangzhou, I would love to explore the remains of the olden China with Rayvern Chng! There will be lotsa exploration, eating and of course shopping. We will be able to into an adventure (:$$I so wanna go guangzhou with you, firstly I know you're a fun loving person and friendly I like to be with someone like you, and definitely this trip will be an awesome n fun trip ever! You can find scores of gorgeous natural parks and historic spots interspersed in this modern city, such as White Cloud Mountain and Chen Ancestral Shrine. Modern buildings and theme parks in the urban area, like Canton Tower and Chimelong Holiday Resort, mark Guangzhou as an international-level developed city. There are many shopping streets and shopping centers in -Guangzhou covering everything that you might need. Food from china especially dim sum and shopping is my favourite pasttime. Lynn Ngai$$I want to go guangzhou with my sister!! As we have never travel together since a really long time ago, and both of us have never been to guangzhou before.. We been both tied down with work. If we could just get sometime away from work to go travel together, better still that the traveling is free, that would be the nicest ever weekend for a start in the new year! <3$$I wish to be chosen with Jay Chong to #scootwithTSL to Guangzhou because it's to celebrate our friendship of 6 years and counting together! We first met in poly, when his first impression of me was that I'm cold, aloof and distant; to me, he was a habitual latecomer. Our negative impressions of each other only improved when we were serving NS together; he sought me out thru MSN, and we started hanging out together, and got rid of the negative connotations we had of each other. We spent our nights out together and went clubbing til we were dead drunk on the evenings and bitched about horrible superiors in NS. Fast forward 6 years, our friendship is still strong despite hiccups along the way, and we are STILL bitching about our superiors, this time at work. So the free Guangzhou trip would be good for us to go on a holiday together ever since our last one a few years back! =)$$My buddy and I had never been to GuangZhou before. Meantime, as we are graduate from poly soon and planning to travel to GuangZhou for our graduation trip this year. this giveaways are surely suitable for us. Hope to win this travel package and we will definitely enjoy the trip!! We always want to visit GuangZhou as it is well-known for its foods, shopping as well as sightseeing. Hope to win!!!$$What?? FREE flight ticket & expenses!! This is amazing! Let us join your big adventure. If I could win, i wish to bring Christina Tan along as my travel buddy for shopping, food and of course the scenery in Guangzhuo!!$$I would like to travel to Guang Zhou because I've never been there. And it would be great to have a chance to step on new grounds with open eyes and open minds to just absorb and learn. Everywhere new to me is an adventure and I would hope to have a chance to be part of an amazing adventure! (:(:$$I have never been to Guangzhou before and it be great to have a well-deserving break after a year filled with submissions from design school. Also!!! I would be able to visit my friend who is residing in GZ. It be a plus to be able to bring my mother along!! It's been a bad start of a new year with one of my uncle passing on. It would help to relieve her burden without her spending money. She would love to visit China as she have never been there before!! Shorter hai di Lao queue + wholesale market!! A PLUS TO GO!!$$Travel buddy: Toh Wee Leong

I want to go to Guangzhou because traveling to China and being able to experience it's colorful medley of sights and sounds has always been on my bucket list. China is a country steeped in history and heritage, and even with the inexorable modernization of parts of this vast, beautiful land, vestiges of that heritage remain with fierce resistance. It is this dichotomous existence of awe-inspiring futuristic buildings, modern landscapes, and yet age-old monumental structures and natural scenic environment of mountains and rivers that I seek to experience all in one place, and Guangzhou city is the epitome of that! I would probably cruise along Pearl River, visit Guangzhou's markets, witness for myself the phenomenal White Clouds Mountain, not to mention, go for some shopping (who needs Taobao when you have Guangzhou?!), relish the Cantonese cuisine (I want to taste the mouthwatering XIAO LONG BAOS!!!!!!), and the list might never end! Please take me to my wonder destination! ✈️🇨🇳

Ps: Please believe that I am a hardcore fan of China, I even took up China Studies back in junior college. Taobao is also my best friend. My father is also a huge fan of China which probably explains everything.$$Would love to SCOOT to Guangzhou as I've never ever been there! I would love to take tons or pics and try all the dim sum/food and seek out new experiences! Would love to share it all with others around me! 😌 I WANNA LIVE THE ADVENTURE!!! SCOOT ME OVER TO GUANGZHOU!!! 💗$$Land of Dim sum 😍 never been to Guangzhou before and this would be The Great opportunity to be exploring a part of China! (Cause I've never been before) Please bring me there! 🙋🏽 yes to more traveling and exploring the world! 🌍$$I never had a chance to travel with my cousin whom is a sister to me to a trip overseas. Its gonna be a lifetime experience for me and I wanna be YOLO  and  explore Guangzhou and try all the exotic / local food. so scoot scoot and fly me & my cuzzie to guangzhou #flyscoot #scootwithTSL #YOUNGWILDNFREE #Yolo$$Reasons why I want to travel to Guangzhou is because I love exploring and traveling to different places to try their different cuisines! And I've been watching the TSLtravel videos since it started and it would definitely be fun travelling with the TSLteam to explore the country together :)  Additionally, I haven't been there and I know there's so much to see, try, eat, play at Guangzhou that I want to be a part of and experience it first-hand!! :)",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Last week, wires obstructing the sightline of Plaza Roma, from which the centuries-old Manila Cathedral is situated, have been finally removed, giving visitors, photographers, and Instagrammers a better view of the Cathedral.

This is just a preview of the big things to come.
Early next year, as part of the rehabilitation of Calle Aduana, the Intramuros Administration will begin to remove the rest of the poles and bury all the cables along this historic street, while redesigning its streetscape for a more pedestrian and bicycle-friendly environment.

The list is created from the votes of 300-plus industry experts across Asia.","I would gladly visit her restaurant during my next visit. Overall filipino cuisine, when trying to imitate European or American tastes, has left me greatly disappointed. Plus: While most ordinary filipinos are warm and welcoming, in restaurants they seem to not have a clue about hospitality. This accounts especially for touristy areas, where you will often find lacklustre Italians or even German restaurants (most of them owned by italians or germans who clearly have no passion at all). Filipino cuisine, unlike most pundits will tell you, does not have to hide from other cuisines at all. You can get absolutely delicious dishes, for example in Restaurants in Makati. Simple Lang - Ayala Triangle was the best Restaurant i visited during my last trip. So please do not try to imitate Italians in a sad way, stick to your own cuisine and be proud of it - you surely can!$$My wife and I had the pleasure to taste Gaita's famed cooking when she came to visit Edinburgh and was invited as an honoured guest of Kuya Greg and sister Isabel Fernandez of Lyncliff Hotel. What an unforgettable experience. Congratulations Margarita Fores.$$The Best Chef is who share the best recipes 😀🍜🍗🍢$$Congratulations !!!

This famous cheese tart shop from Hokkaido creates their cheese tarts using 3 different types of cheese with ingredients flown in from Japan.

Be prepared to queue till the hype dies down. Are the cheese tarts really that good? Find out in our video below!

Address: ION Orchard #B4-33, S238801
Price: $3.50 a piece.
Current wait: 2 hours+

The cookie-crust and combination of 3  cheeses makes the tarts taste exqusite, but it can get cloying afterawhile. So we recommend sharing and eating the tarts slowly.

The Central – Mid-Levels Escalator system, the world's longest outdoor covered escalator system, running for 800 meters. It links Des Voeux Road Central to Conduit Road in the Mid- Levels.

Traveling the entire length takes about 20 minutes. The escalators are free of charge and run downhill between 6am and 10am and uphill from 10:30am to midnight.

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University’s Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Best Regards
Yours Cordially

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Calbayog or Tacloban. Or take a bus from Manila to Tacloban. Or take a boat from Cebu to Calbayog or Ormoc.

Adjacent to the Mahabodhi Temple is the Bodhi tree itself under which Prince Siddhartha Gautama is said to have attained Enlightenment 2,500 years ago.

Beaches are natural, clean and beautiful.$$Lovely Pangkor with its pretty beaches, yummy seafood and wonderful kampong vibes!$$Perak has a lot to offer I used to live in Ipoh, the food always great.

I fell in love with The Royal Belum Forest n Temenggor Lake n the Jungle of Perak.$$My family and I went to Belum Rainforest and Lake Temenggor in June 2001.  We had an awesome trip - exploring the lower part of Belum where we trekked up the slippery ground in search of the famous rafflesia, an eye-opening visit to the  aborigines village where life is very simple and basic and time seems to stand still, and a tiring but rewarding trek up to Sungai Enam Base Camp where we had a refreshing dip in the cool waterfall. 

We were there for 5 days, exploring the Banding trail, belum rainforest, the nearby town of Gerik (we had lovely chats with the friendly locals and I got to try the ikan pekasam which I like so much) and even managed a day trip to Betong, Thailand through the Pengkalan Hulu border. I must say that our trip to Belum was very exciting and adventurous for us. We even enjoyed the long road trip (we drove abt 10 hrs all the way from S'pore to Banding), taking in the lovely sights of the natural landscape that 'paints' the state of Perak.$$The 40,000-hectare Matang Mangrove Forest in Kuala Sepetang. Today, it is recognized as the best managed sustainable mangrove ecosystem in the world.

Siargao, Surigao del Norte

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Fly from Taiwan or Manila to Laoag.

Or take a bus from Cubao or Pasay to Laoag.

Just outside the municipality of Pagudpud, along the coast of Bangui bay, you’ll see a row of huge windmills measuring 23-storeys high. These giant electric fans help provide up to 40% of electricity to Ilocos Norte.

To see another towering spectacle, you can make a quick drive to Burgos, Ilocos Norte to see the Cape Bojeador Lighthouse.

The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) is the premiere showcase of the arts in the country. Founded in 1969 under the Marcos regime, it still continues to hold the most celebrated and award-winning plays from around the world. At night, it's therapeutic to watch the fountain lightshow — a colorful oasis by the side of the main road, in the middle of a busy metro.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
In the main lobby of the National Theater, you'll notice three large Capiz-shell chandeliers hanging from the third-floor ceiling. They symbolize the three main geographical divisions of the Philippines — Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

Must have taken several centuries to naturally form this rare pearl., bred in the richest marine ecosystem that Palawan is ! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🇵🇭$$It took more than five weeks to locate the secretive dog slaughterhouse. Raiding it almost cost a Network for Animals activist his life.
We located the building in the south of the Philippine mainland. An innocuous house at the end of a dirt road, hiding a grim secret: an illegal dog slaughtering operation, protected by well-paid security guards, who swung into action every time the killing commenced.

Our team secretly monitored the building. The heat, humidity, mosquito and ant bites took their toll. But it was nothing compared to what the poor dogs would experience:
Forced into rusting metal cages, their sensitive noses would know the aging scent of canine blood on the air. They must know their time is short, because those cages are hell-on-earth. Excruciating temperatures, horrific humidity, and nowhere to rest but on-or-under the bodies of your cell mates. No water. No food. No hope.
The illegal slaughterhouse owner earns more than $11,000 each month and protects his business with a pistol and fierce temper. Our team leader Mel and his companion Perry knew this when they were discovered hiding in bushes on July 14th. Mel ran until he almost fainted, but Perry was not so fast, or so lucky: He was captured.

Mel quickly returned to the slaughterhouse with the only available policeman. When it became clear that Perry had been abducted, four more officers arrived. Achingly slowly, the terrifying situation was diffused. 36 dogs were seized, and eventually our teammate was returned safely from the hostage situation. It could have been so much worse.$$WE LOVE AND PROTECT THE NATURE IN THE PHILIPPINES!

 Cebu City, Visayas

How to Get There:
Fly to Cebu from Manila, Clark or any of the key cities in the country. There are also scheduled flights from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita in Japan and Incheon, South Korea.

Buses bound for Cebu leave from Dumaguete, Oriental Negros and Bacolod, Negros Occidental every hour.

It is also possible to take your car here via a Roll On-Roll Off (RORO) ferry. 

What is it?
Fiestas are the best parties. Even if they're celebrated in honor of saints, the costumes, street dancing, music and merrymaking are always great!

Fun Fact:
Three of the biggest fiestas in the Visayas are held each year in January in honor of Sto. Niño (Child Jesus) -- Sinulog in Cebu, Dinagyang in Iloilo and Ati-atihan in Aklan.

Once the capital of the princely state of Patnagarh, the district town of Bolangir, also spelt Balangir, still retains its old world’s charm and serenity.One of the major commercial towns in the western part of Odisha, the place is littered with the remnants of the past. 

What makes Bolangir a compelling travel destination is its scenic beauty, numerous shrines and the native tribal life. Driving through a thick forest cover to reach any place of interests is a rewarding experience. Many visitors use the town as a base to several places of interest located in the district. Traditional hand-woven textiles life will allure the ethnic tourists.

We stay at Kolkata. My son works in Bangalore. We went to Bangalore for two weeks. So, we hoped that we would enjoy a quite stay for two nights in this place, as it was very close to Bangalore, only 60 kms away. 
Nandi Hills is about 4500 ft high. Hotel Pine Top is situated in a beautiful place on the hill top in an isolated place. We reached the hotel at about 17 hrs in the dusk of 26.06.2015, by climbing a serpentine hilly road and became exited to enjoy the coming nights. 
When we arrived at the reception desk of Hotel Pine Top, we found that there were some hotel personnel seated near the entrance and some guests were enjoying evening tea and snacks in adjacent dining room. On the way, we also noticed a lot of parked cars, as it was Friday, the beginning of a weekend. 
We informed the hotel personnel that we had room bookings. They advised us to wait, but none came forward. After a while, one person moved to us. We told him that we had prior booking and showed him the reservation voucher. He called another person, who took our luggage, guided us to downstairs and opened two rooms. Rooms were two stories below the reception and one would have to climb down by the stairs by the side of the building. It was drizzling and the sky was extremely cloudy.
The rooms were glass-fitted with open front view of the valley. The view was really superb. There were steps to go down to a garden. From there, vast valley was being seen. The place was really calm and quite. There was a half-circle view-point in the complex, in the same level of reception, from where the view was more wide open.
But we could not stay. When we reached the reception, we found that everyone was disliking our presence. No one greeted us, as if we were non-invitees. No one was coming forward to speak with us. The person, who moved to us informed that there was no room available. No welcome message. Later we found that there was no other boarder beside us. When we informed that we had prior reservation, he told with a stoned face that there was shortage of water and electricity, as it was a hilly area. Might be. Then came the next point. We would have to take dinner within 7 PM, as there would no electricity after 7 PM. Water would be not available after 7 PM, 
We, however, accepted the proposal as we had nothing to do and nowhere to go. But, when the rooms were opened for us, no electricity was present in the rooms. Then we found no water in the tap in the bathrooms with lots of cockroaches in the rooms and bathrooms. Rooms were not clean and linens were not fresh and at some places dirty. It was becoming dark and we were horrified to find that big rats were moving freely inside the rooms and bathrooms. Street dogs were freely circling in the corridor and garden. We also came to know that mobile network would not work there. We were puzzled to think what to do in that evening. However, we decided not to stay in that horrible place. There was also no telephone connection between the rooms and the reception upstairs. So, at night, if there would be any emergency, we would find our way through rodents and dogs to go to reception upstairs, might be no one would be available there. After a good thought, we did not take any risk to stay there. Luckily, Bangalore was not far away.
We came back to the reception with our luggage and asked for the complaint book. When we told the hotel personnel that we would not stay, none asked us the reason, as if it was a better decision. We also noticed that in the complaint register, there were similar complaints by the previous boarders/customers, but KSTDC took no step. We wrote our grievances in the complaint register, but till date, no official from KSTDC/Karnataka Government telephoned us or made any query. We understood that though we noticed a lot of cars, all those people would return back to Bangalore in the evening and none would stay there at night. But we came from Kolkata,a far away place, to enjoy and were cheated. Probably, KSTDC/Karnataka Government does not have time to bother in such petty matter.
On our way back to Bangalore, we found other nearby hotels/resorts/lodges with electricity arrangements. We toured to other hilly remote places, even in high altitude, where supply of power were arranged at least upto 9/10 pm. Nandi Hills is a very good place for 1-2 nights stay, as it is very near to Bangalore. We could not understand why Karnataka Government was not developing the place. The hotel is beautifully placed, rooms are not bad, a big restaurant is attached, approachable road is there and lots of tourists come to this place. Only some developments, like electricity, water and mobile tower, are to be made. Then many other hoteliers will be interested to come to this place and the place will turn into a hot tourist spot. It is a good business opportunity for the local Government and also an avenue for development of local people. Instead of improving the place, KSTDC is charging higher for the weekends. The tariff of a double-bedded room was Rs.1150 in normal weekdays, whereas in the weekend it would jump to Rs.1500, which we had to pay in full. We felt very sorry that we could not enjoy this beautiful place. State Government is turning a deaf ear to the complaints made by the past boarders/customers, as the hotel personnel should inform the authorities that we left the hotel without staying. It was a case of cheating in the part of Karnataka Government. It is known to common people like us that the hotels/lodges run by Government/state bodies are safer and better places than the private ones.
We hope that Karnataka Government/KSTDC should be ashamed for charging boarders/customers without giving any normal basic amenities and should make booking after developing the hotel and area.

This picturesque hill retreat is covered by grassy meadows, with a profusion of sunflowers, marigolds and rhododendrons, all growing wild. 

Coonoor’s weather remains pleasantly cool throughout the year and this together with its serene surrounding, makes it an ideal place for a peaceful break.

Where the hell was their PRS on 1st, 2nd and 3rd June from 10:00 AM to 10:05 AM? 
 .
 .
 As if the PRS was not working, then how the tickets could be regretted during that period? 
 .
 . 
 Who should answer ?... Indian Railway, IRCTC or the airlines company.. 
 .
 .
 Prestige's.. I m regularly bomb shelled by checking the PRS system from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM. The review of activity is like this
 [
 10:00 AM-10:05 AM The PRS system is failed in all India. Still the tickets sold during that period.. this is illogical and bit to surprise.

10:05 AM-10:25 AM a common IRCTC user mainly face a problem related to the payment gateway. 

10:25 AM-12:00 PM Everything becomes normal, if u call the customer care executive.. they will ask for the problem screenshots. And that is resolved in 2 months

I checked the airlines after. The ticket is became costlier than 15,000/-, so, I think its better to fly London or Singapore instead of flying to Ranchi from New Delhi. The prize is even same.

""Naturally flavored truffle oil (olive oil with black truffle)
Truffle oil is a modern culinary ingredient, used to impart the flavor and aroma of truffles to a dish. Most truffle oils are not made from actual truffles. Instead they are a synthetic product that combines a thioether (2,4-dithiapentane), one of numerous aromas or odorants found in truffles, with an olive oil or grapeseed oil base.""

""I saw your recent post regarding future Singapore MRT/LRT maps and thought I’d throw mine into the ring. The Singapore MRT has long been one of my fave metro systems around the world. 

I like the concept of destination numbers and station numbers - I believe it is one of the first, if not the first, to use this concept (do let me know if that’s not quite right).  

My approach for this map is to incorporate the station number into the station marker itself to avoid some of the clutter associated placing the station name AND the number alongside the station marker.  

Also, I really wanted the Circle Line to be a circle, so I have adopted a few distortions to make that happen. Finally, I tried to incorporate geography of Singapore in a stylistic manner to further reinforce the circle motif.

Biri Rock Formation, Northern Samar

What is it like? 
Biri Rock Formation is made of seven different massive rocks jutting out of the ground. Formed 24 million years ago, these rocks go as high as a three-story building.

Fun Fact: 
These rocks were formed by earthquakes that caused tectonic plates to move into each other.

Who will take more than 10 rides a day (roughly equalling the value of a day pass) and also given the fact that there are no busses included...am I missing something?
Its so bad, especially for Koreans, that there is no proper daily, weekly or monthly tickets for public transportation in Seoul. Ticket fares seem to be cheap, but it adds up, if you have to commute every day..$$As excited as I am to see Seoul putting effort into doing something good for foreigners, I am inclined to agree with Paul. As someone who doesn't live in Seoul, but likes to go for weekends and holidays, I cannot see myself ever making this pass to be financially efficient. It seems like a LOT of money. If it were up to me, I'd lower the price to 5,000 won a day, and lower the number of possible rides to 10 or 15 a day (not including line transfers, those should not be counted.) I have NEVER known a foreigner to take more then 10 subway trips a day, let alone meet the maximum number of 20.$$Hmm it does seem a little expensive for a day pass - I love the Metro in Seoul - but the best way to see Seoul is walk around its amazing what you miss between stations! 20,000won on a T Money card can  last about a week for me!$$Mufizah- The M-pass allows you to make up to twenty trips in 1 day for 10,000 won, so it is ideal for travelers planning to take a large number of trips on the subway in one day because it gives a savings over the normal rate if you take more than 10 subway rides in a single day. However, it can't be used for buses or in other metropolitian areas, or recharged like a T-money card.$$I love Seoul subway !!!!! Nvr thought it will be easy till I 've tried it out last yr ;)$$That card is way to expensive. Most cities have cards that make up there value with only 3-5 rides. This one takes more than 10 to be worth it. Don't buy if coming to Seoul. $$...So not really a good option unless you plan to spend you day on the subway lol!$$Even then it might be cheaper to take the t-money, just take line nr. 1 all day :)$$Great idea and a huge help for travellers! Is there a similar thing for other cities in Korea?$$Hi Travel Bug! This is just for the Seoul subway.$$i already try it..it's fun & easy too..hehe..luv to try again next time$$I think this is actually a great idea!  This pass if for tourists coming into Seoul, a ride on the train from Incheon to Seoul Station is about 4,000 won one way and then you are forgetting  that base fare is 900 won with a card, and it increases as you travel over distance.  And think about tourists would don't necessarily realize that a destination is much closer walking than taking the subway for one stop?  I know people would rather feel safe knowing that they can take the subway for one stop and exactly know where they are when they exit the subway.

20 rides are day for 10,000 won is quite generous actually, since 10,000 won for Seoulites is only about 8 - 10 rides...$$Hi Ana! It is a day pass costing 10,000 won and is good for up to 20 rides in one day.

Tam-Awan Village, Baguio

What is it like? 
Baguio City is a city on the Cordillera Central mountain range, which is 1,600 meters above sea level. The place is lined with pine trees, and has a subtropical highland climate with temperatures going down as low as nine degrees Celcius during the cool months of December, January and February. ""The Summer Capital of the Philippines"" can get a little crowded during March, April and May, when people from other cities come for a visit to escape the urban heat. 

Fun Fact: 
Tam-Awan was built to showcase a model village of authentic Ifugao huts, which are expertly constructed without the use of nails. The compact huts are elevated to shoulder level by four sturdy wooden posts. Tam-Awan is a popular tourist site in Baguio City not only for its huts, but also for its art galleries, annual art exhibits, workshops and cultural performances.

Tubbataha Reef, Palawan

What is it? 
Schooling is when a group of fish swim together in one direction. They do this to fend off predators by creating a “confusion effect,” where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

Fun Fact: 
Shoaling is different from schooling. Shoaling is when a species of fish are grouped close together, but are swimming independently. Tubbataha has 600 species of fish that either school or shoal.

Geox is a trustable brand for its comfyness which is stylish, at the same time, to match with all types of outfits! With this pair of boots, I don't have to worry about packing so many shoes into my luggage anymore!

We leave our empty drinks in our movie cinemas seats. Random tissue papers are always floating on MRT seats. We choke drains with our cigarrates. And we don't even think twice about it. Because garbage on the street is better than in our pockets. 

Some of us have become so entitled that we say we ""help"" the cleaners by giving them a ""job"" to do. That's when you know something is wrong. Maybe that's why we don't return our food trays.

I'm guilty for being part of those groups at parties who don't clean up well, leaving cleaners with a ton of extra work to do. It seems normal when no one seems to care. But I'm not going to act that way again. 

Let us know if you want to do something about littering by leaving a comment or by sharing this video so more people see it.

Women are roses raised on different soils,
Their color may vary from place to place,
but their roles are permanently synonymous to the word Importance,
Their beauty transcends universe boundaries,
They can charm us both on pageantry and admire them in warfare,
They are our nectar in paradise and may turn to venom if abused.
They are our mothers who swing our future leaders & heroes hammock,
On our young age, They are our first trainers for us to become future workforce of the world.
They are our wives that warm our home with their love,
They are our sisters in playground and nurse that medicate our wounds in battlefield we chose,
They are our daughters who bring smile to our dolorous exhausted soul,
They are our doting grandma that console us candies and toys in our tantrum.
They are friends in armor when perturbation make our mind consumed,
They are the symbol of blindfolded justice, of liberty, of affection...
Lady Luck is their name sake, their lovely eyes are replete of vision.
They are light of the house that brings hope to the hopeless...
They are the symbol of motherland of every nation in this world...
Women are roses that can tame a gun with its scent,
They can tone down heated conflict by the  wisdom of their verses.
Their thorns will draw blood once it pricks be it by pauper or conqueror's hand,
Women are conduit of Life to infants who feed on their bosoms.
Miracles of Life starts from their womb,
Their Delicate petals can both kiss the morning dew and the scorching sun,
Their non-existence is humankind decimation,
They are consoling flowers for our natal,  betrothal, nuptial, until the funeral.
In both victory and defeat their buds soothes our senses,
Because They are Roses in all of our Life's occasion,
Roses that melt hearts and touches soul by mere sight & redolence.                                                                                                                  Women are sent by God to be of equal importance of Men...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The easternmost hill district of Uttarakhand, Pithoragarh and its surroundings are known for their abundant natural beauty. Nestling in a small valley, barely 5 km long and 2 km wide, the town was an important landmark during the reign of the Chand Rajas of Kumaon. 

Pithoragarh is the district headquarters and its government buildings are housed in the hill fort of Pithoragarh at a distance of 7 km from the main town. From the Chandak hill located here, one gets a panoramic view of snowy ranges extending from the Trishul-Nanda Devi, Panchchuli Group to Mount Appi of Nepal.

Boracay, Aklan

How to Get There:
""Fly from Manila to Caticlan.

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan.

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.""

What is it?
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact:
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

Ah, Boracay. Need we say more? Since much has been said, raved and written about this famous four-kilometer stretch of powder white sand paradise, we would like to suggest you try the most exhilarating activity off it — cliff-diving at Ariel's Point. The highest plank is about 15 meters high, which is as high as a five-storey building. But a jump off it ends with a safe, pleasantly wet landing.

Fun Fact: 
Not a lot of people know that Tribal Adventure Day Tours are offered on this island. These are no ordinary tours. You spend an entire day getting to know the indigenous people living In the area. The women will welcome you into their homes and even cook for your group while you learn about their history and customs. Ask around for D'Arcy Kelly. He runs the show.

If it was destroyed by a bomb during the war then all the posts would've been obliterated already, which was not the case. The city itself was not bombed, much less the wharf! The platform that makes up the runway of the wharf  was made of wood, which were either dismantled or have deteriorated through time.$$I used to go here when I was young, we would then look for ""batad"" and ""sisi"". But because of pollution, it's now dirty and full of accumulated trash from the rivers. I hope the government will do something about it because it is really a sight to behold especially during sunset.$$I used to have mangrove rehabilitation and coastal clean up program near the area.

Additionally, the Asahikawa Heiwa-dori Shopping Street in Asahikawa City, Hokkaido, introduced the new tax-free system on June 1, 2015. 
Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5,001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10,001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district.

For example, buy some Japanese teas, a kimono and anything else you fancy on the shopping street, and when you have finished shopping, just go to the tax refund counter in Seibu Department Store. Enjoy shopping at bargain prices, and take a little taste of Japan back home with you.

Asahikawa City has many other attractions besides shopping, and also a great destination for travelling. Please come and visit!

Puerto Princesa, Palawan

What is it?
If you love having personal space, then Puerto Princesa is the place for you. It's the city with lowest population density in the country, and the second largest in terms of land area. It has many beach resorts and seafood restaurants, and has been acclaimed on several occasions as the cleanest city in the Philippines.

Fun Fact:
The place got its name from Princess Asuncion, the daughter of Queen Isabella II of Spain. She died at a young age, and her mother honored her by calling the island, Puerto de la Princesa.

Siquijor, Visayas

How to Get There:
Take a boat from Cebu to Siquijor.

What is it?
The island is famous for its virgin beaches and secret swimming spots. But the thing about Siquijor that probably resonates the most is its reputation for magic and sorcery. During Good Friday, the island is supposedly the go-to place of witchdoctors from all over the country who are looking to recharge their amulets.

Fun Fact:
Local healers can concoct potions made from oils and herbs for visitors to take home. A scented lana (coconut oil-based ointment) made by a healer is believed to relieve one of stomach aches and body pains.

Negros Occidental, Visayas

What is it?
This province known for its thriving sugar industry.  But it's loved for its chicken inasal -- tender grilled chicken that's been marinated in a secret mixture and brushed with a special oil and is best enjoyed dipped in spiced vinegar.

Fun Fact:
Big chicken inasal meals are best walked off by touring the many American and Spanish colonial houses of Silay City.

Working a job and trying to cook meals for my family is a trying task. It can be tougher  to be a working mom especially when you have a tough job or work long hours. So canned sardines are my favorite quick meals after a long day.  Sardines are packed with nutrients of every kind, and the canned fish are actually even better than the fresh, because with canned sardines, you’re eating the whole fish including the bones that are soft enough to eat, providing a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats in one tasty can!  My daughter loves tomato  sardines with melted cheese and broccoli.  My husband loves chili sardines with rice/noodles.  For me,  I prefer deep fried sardines with eggs &  toast = sardines french toast!  The ways of cooking is endless.  😁😁😁

Despite one income gone, my husband works very hard to give our family a comfortable lifestyle. In addition,  he helps me with the household chores, coaches the children in their studies and spends whatever time he as with the family. He gave up his only hobby (golfing) as he told me golfing took up a considerble amount of time and he rather spend his time with the family. 

He looks like a punctured tyre at the end of each day and my heart cannot help but cry when i see how tired he was. The fact that he did not utter a word of complaint made us appreciate him even more. He is a good husband, caring father and a filial son.

Hope to win and reward my hubby Edmund Joseph Tan for his hard work.$$For me, staycations meant taking time to smell the roses.

Would want to win the awesome wonderful staycation to celebration our first year wedding anniversary at Ramada Hotel Singapore and also swim in the fabulous infinity pool!$$Liked & Shared!

Would love to win this and go on a staycay with my poly friends before FYP starts! Would be a great chance for us to relax before our hectic sem arrives!$$Liked and shared ! 
Hope to win this staycation as my birthday is around the corner, have always been a customer of ramada hotel in malacca, hope to be able to win a staycation over at ramada Singapore !$$Liked and shared! 
Hoping to take this chance of a Staycay to recharge before the start of a hectic semester, and to explore the side of Singapore that we don't really go to.$$If I win I will make myself free to gather with my loved ones especially  with my precious mum. My mum is my superstar. She is always behind me no matter what I do. Never forgetting her unconditional love showered upon me, her relentless care and concern and intricate daily routine for the family.
My mum took charge of everything ranging from the household chores to taking care of the children. My heartpain whenever I see her dry and flaky hand due to constant soaking in detergent during washing. I came from a poor family. Life was excruciatingly hard and there was never a single day she was not struggling with small expenses. (just imagine the years of pain and hardships she encountered bringing us up since we were kids). The mental and physical burden weighing on her had never been lighter, but heavier as the list of expenses and expectations got more demanding as we grew older. Nevertheless I had never seen her fall sick, frown or complain dramatically over the intolerable level of hardship. She never once gave up nor chose to quit. She will ensure that we are well fed at the very bare minimum - which is what she always prioritize over everything.
She sacrifices to take care of us no matter how hard - such that everyone of us kids turned out well. She dotes on us more than anyone else in the world. Her advices are inspiring and enlightening. She led and taught us how to be good such that not a single of us siblings go astray in a poverty environment. I feel really heartpain and touched. She was frugal on herself but never hesitant to spend on her kids, esp on our education. I know she loves staycation but has refused to join me for that luxurious experience several times as she does not want to inflict that pinch on my financial pocket. I would like to repay her (get rid of some of her burden at the very bare minimum) and pamper her with this fabulous staycation - she really deserves such treat she needs, as she has sacrificed way too much for her kids. I cherish every moments with my mum for I know that time waits for no man and I do not want to miss any moment with her.

The winning of this magnificent staycation will be a very special treat, it will certainly bring happiness and a content smile on her face and laughter to my siblings as we enjoy the staycation together as a family. 

This splendid staycation will definitely be the most precious, meaningful, warming, enjoyable and memorable for everyone esp my lovely mum. Thanks for the awesome giveaway.
Hope to win and makes my dream come true!!$$Liked and shared! 

Hope to win for my deaf husband's coming birthday (November) as well as we married for 24 years. We had our honeymoon in Ramada Hotel in Gold Coast, Australia 23 years ago. 

It will be perfect gift to us. Thanks for this kind giveaway in advance.$$Liked and shared! 
Since my son (first one) was born a year ago, me and my husband never had a time just for both of us, especially with a 1 bedroom house with my inlaw stay with us to take care of my son while both me and husband are working daily. I hope and I really wish i could win this staycation. It would be a dream come true for both me and my husband. Thank you!$$Done!!! My cousin's 2year old birthday was held there, and they bought a package for a staycation at Zhongshan park hotel, where there was a buffet spread the day after and allowed their guests (inc. my family ) to try out their amazing variety spread of buffet. The hotel was very picturesque , and furthermore I had also uploaded my ootd at the little lake/ pool as the background further point the contrast of my outfit. It's a nice tranquil place and I hope I can win this for my family and close friends to stay and chill there, over a peaceful atm, away from the hustle and bustle of sg$$Liked & Shared
This Staycation Giveaway is indeed something I really need. The past year as been a hard toll on kids and myself. I really need a break to just relax and clear my mind. Nevermind which one but will really appreciate this chance to get to cause I've never been on a staycation let alone a trip for myself.... I deserve to just pamper myself, recharge, let go of all the stress and come back to my kids a better mum... happier and fresh.. So looking forward to the good news ...Thank you... 😌$$Liked and shared! What an awesome giveaway! My mum birthday is nearing and she has been really tired and never enjoy much of her life, and other than treating her sumptuous food, I hope she also can enjoy staycation in sg. And definitely the buffet is mouth drooling for her. 😂 This giveaway comes at the right time! I hope I can win this and surprise my mum! Thanks. 💜👍$$Liked & Shared.

Our friends The MeatMen show you how these gula melaka bombs will have you going for more once you have your first!

Full Ondeh ondeh recipe: http://themeatmen.sg/ondeh-ondeh/ ","This is Indonesia traditional dessert called ""klepon"".
Onde2 uses the same glutinous rice fluor, filling with mung bean paste and covered with sesame. Klepon and Onde2 are both traditional dessert of Indonesia$$I love this kuih onde onde or gula Melaka . I noticed in every Asian countries I went to there are similarities in food for example this also you can found in Vietnam but they call it differently so why must you argue where it's originated? We are all came from the same root/ region and sharing nearly the same type of food and even some have similarities in culture. Let's enjoy the food that bring people together.$$THANK YOU for saying the name right. And yes. it's a Malay kueh.$$this is basically same like tangyuen, but we use pandan leaves as flavoring and coated em with the coconut :3 Kim Yean$$Great. We're sharing a wonder recipe for everyone to enjoy and some arsehole trolls decided to come and claim this and that.  Only insecure people needs to claim this and that. The rest enjoys it the same regardless of origin.$$I'm so sick of ppl fighting about what is the real name of this kuih and the origin. Like seriously? Don't you guys have any other important issue to be think of?! Gosh. Just enjoy the food. Even in malaysia they are some ppl who call it onde2 and some call it gula melaka. But we never fight about what is the real name because we just enjoy th food. Get a life.$$This is in indonesia this name KLEPON$$Malaysia always claim something from Indonesia, can't you be more creative with your own thing? Thank you$$Every time I come back to Singapore, I have to go hunting for these.  The lil' neighbourhood Malay kueh stalls and that special, lovingly-homemade taste seems to be in short supply.$$Omg this is one of our fav!
Why everybody arguing abt this?
Asian singapore malay malaysia malay indonesia have very similar food history bcos we're all rojak! (What is not the same is country history) The malays here are javanese mix bawean mix bugis mix and we are all malay 😑$$Thank you for your recipe. Your recipe is highly reliable. May I ask if I would like to tweak that by using sweet potato, what's the sweet potato to
Flour ratio?$$Thumbs up for people who came here to see some yummy onde-onde/ondeh-ondeh or however ur country calls it as in the making process to entertain our saliva and not caring about it's origin just that it's an Asian delicacy$$Why are people fighting over who's dessert is this? At the end of the day, we all came from the same ""rumpun"" aka roots.. It's just food anyway. I'd be glad to know if I can find food/deserts that I love in various parts of the world..$$......yeah, I know it 's yummy....did that once in a  blue moon....using pandan leaves is the best ...nothing can beat the original flavour n aroma....Long live pandan leaf...!!!!...<3$$Gayle Lim is this the recipe you're planning to follow? I don't even eat this back home but I craving now hahahaha it's like tang yuan with sugar filling and coconut outside like that$$I don't care about the name, I just want to eat. If I say ondeonde and am met with blank stares, I just point to it and say ""that one"" and I still get to eat it. Who cares as long as it goes into the mouth? If it's different then I got to try something else, all the merrier.

Anyway this is a Singapore page so this food is known as onde-onde here. Just like we call roti prata here and not roti chennai. Peace.$$Actually as know this kuih is nyonya melaka. Those days wen m small only chinese aunties at my village sold during morning market. Talking about 45 years ago.$$I heard some people put a lil bit of salt in the coconut so the onde onde will be a lil salty outside n sweet inside.$$Actually gula anau is the best and the taste is slightly different from gula melaka..but gula melaka is commonly used for onde2..and that's why gula anau is slightly expensive than gula melaka bcause it is made from pokok anau..I love onde2 😋$$Good to steam the fresh coconut for 15-20 min with a pinch of salt. Helps coconut from spoiling too quickly.$$Jamil Adams omg I learnt how to make this in boarding! But Miss taught us with green food colouring 😂😂😂 and we all added too much sugar it exploded but it was so cool tho cause we got to make it into different shapes! You should've done it w us!$$That is javanese kueh from indonesia name is KLEPON or onde onde ( sumatra's call that kueh )$$I love this kueh....it's comfort food and reminds me of home... doesn't really matter who lays claim to it and honestly it should not really matter.

I didn't understand korean (i started learning november2009) and I didn't even think about learning it since he can speak English well. We talk a lot, everyday, and I have this feeling that we have mutual feelings with each other. But you know, Filipina girls are really reserved(I am), so I waited for him to make the first move, I waited and Waited, but my waiting game dragged till mid 2009. Earlier that year, he would speak Korean to me randomly, ask questions or just random sentences I don't understand. I would ask him what it was but he'll just laugh it off and change the topic. So I really didn't bother, I was so focused on his presence. 
then one time I was watching a Historical Korean Drama, one phrase from the main actors dialogue sounds really familiar, bec he always say that to me. It was an old way to say 'I like You very much'. 
I almost kicked my laptop and remembered he alao mentioned a few times before, in korean, '저랑 데트이 할래?' in which i would just look at him puzzled in response.

So i did my own research, there are 100s so couldn’t decide. However a friend recently told me about a home whitening kit because she had good results. I had to search for it online as it’s usually only given as part of an after care solution once you’ve has laser teeth whitening, but they now sell them separately. 

It’s called White Guard home teeth whitening kit, it’s non peroxide so claims it won’t damage teeth. It worked really well for me, but that’s no guarantee it will for you. And no i’m not being paid/sponsored, i’m just a regular girl who has no affiliation to any supplier of products. 

I’m just cynical about independent reviews as the same mags and publications trot out the same brands pushing the same products day after day, do they think we are stupid or sheep. If you’ve found a product via your own research and testing that turns out to be really good, do same as me and add to comments section for such products so that real women like me and you aren’t being sold the usual suspects and get to try other good products.

Calanggaman Island, Leyte

What is it like? 
By those who know about it, this ten-hectare hidden gem is adored for its supremely fine white sands. But the real adventure begins below the surface – with up to 30-meter visibility and an expansive reef, this marine reserve also provides a mystifying dive experience.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Calbayog or Tacloban.                                           Or take a bus from Manila to Tacloban.                                           Or take a boat from Cebu to Calbayog or Ormoc.

Fun Fact: 
The island gets its name from the Cebuano word for bird, possibly owing to the two sandbars that stretch out like wings from its shores.

51km southwest of Bhavnagar, Palitana is famous destination in Gujarat for being the base to the Shatrunjaya hill on which stands a conglomeration of 863 exquisitely carved Jain shrines built by devotees during a period spanning 900 years from the 11th century onwards. Along with Mts. Abu, Girnar and Chandragiri, Shatrunjaya is one of the most sacred places for the Jains.

Tell us your answers in the comments section, and keep sending us your stills, videos and blog posts for a shot at being featured. ","Para Sa Mga Nagdadalawang Isip Para Iboto Si Mayor Duterte please read this:

The attacks against Mayor Duterte is so intense. I've never seen such attacks against a frontrunner in the past 2 National Elections. With just few days left, these will even intensify. If you are a supporter and thinking of withdrawing your vote for Duterte because of his issues, brace yourselves and remember the reason why you supported Duterte in the first place. We've started from the bottom, now we're here. Change is coming. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future. This man has a huge sincere heart that I believe will benefit the country.

Maraming nagsasabi na ""if you want change, start in yourself at wag iasa sa magiging pangulo."" I agree, pero wag nating kaligtaan na marami ding mga tao na kahit kaya nilang simulan yung pagbabago sa sarili nila, kailangan padin nila ng isang tagapanguna na kaya silang tulungan na mangyari yung pagbabago na hindi lang sa sarili nila kundi sa kabuuan ng isang bansa. I believe that Duterte is the man.

Everytime he talks about his country and the change that he wants to bring, he is very sincere. Para siyang stand-up comedian bago magstart yung 2nd debate sa TV-5 (joking about Mar going to restroom and not knowing a single person from the audience), nakakatawa. He is known for his gutter language at offensive siya minsan. Sabi nga ng iba parang di siya nagiisip bago magsalita. But everytime he speaks about his love for the country and concern for his fellow Filipinos, he is very sincere. He has the most heartfelt messages. Sincerity makes the very least person to be of more value than the most talented ones.

He is also the candidate na hindi uhaw na uhaw na maging presidente. I believe it’s because his heart is really for the people and not for the position. He said many times that he will not die if he does not become a president. He said he will not apologize for who he is even if he lose the presidency.

While the other candidates in the last debate promoted themselves as the rightful president and expressed their confidence in winning the election, he simply said, “Wala akong hangarin except for my country. And I pray to God that the nation will be enlightened with His Grace, and you can choose the leader, bahala na kayo kung sino, the one who can make it happen.” Did you see that? Tayo na daw bahala. Di niya tayo pinipilit o pinapakiusapan na siya ang iboto. Also notice, his desire is for the country and his prayer is not for the people to be enlightened by his track record, leadership and platform (though those were really good), but be enlightened by God’s grace. He did not rely on himself and his achievements, he entrusted everything in the Grace of God.

I don’t want to sound like a priest but I hope that the religious leaders noticed it too. Only Duterte and Miriam mentioned in their closing speech that they are praying to God for the welfare of this nation. You see? Si Mayor Duterte, palamura, womanizer daw, corrupt daw, murderer daw, in other words makasalanan. But he is seeking God’s grace in this endeavour.

I’d rather support this “sinner” who depends on the grace of God than those religious leaders and self-righteous politicians who depend on themselves. I’d rather vote for someone na hindi “disente"" at hindi atat na manalo kaysa dun sa sumisigaw na siya ang mananalo. I will choose Duterte for his sincerity and desire to make sure that his fellowmen are safe and free from criminality, drugs, and corruption.

Sabi ng karamihan magdesisyon daw ayon sa character, moralidad, at kakayahan ng isang kandidato. Nope, ang desisyon ko ay base sa sinseridad at pagdepende ng kandidato sa biyaya ng Diyos. Because God’s grace can transform someone’s character and morality into better. But it cannot change a self-righteous person simply because they won’t even see the need for that Grace because they just depend on their own goodness.

Now, what if one day I realized that I supported the wrong person? Then be it. Life goes on. We just learn from it. In fact, we have been making bad decisions in electing Senators, VP and President in the past. Who knows this time, we’re making a good one. They say that a vote for Duterte is a high risk. Well, I'm taking the risk because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. I don’t really think that this 71 year old man would like to be remembered as a bad leader. I believe that he wants to leave a legacy that will change the course of this country.

It is apparent that there is a very strong opposition to stop the Davao City Mayor. But the greater the opposition, the greater the opportunity. An opportunity to stop the dominion of the elites and oligarchs. An opportunity to fight, suppress and stop drugs, crime and corruption. An opportunity to clean the government and the system. Change is coming. Lets DU it! Duterte for President!$$Amazingly captured by me in my hometown Gumaca,province of Quezon during my vacation..$$Nice shot  ...

1. It was one of the hardest and most miserable painful things I've ever done and I was still young then. Must be in very good shape!! We hurt for over 1.5 weeks!
2. Couldn't see the summit nor crater lake due to heavy fog and rain. 
3. I felt it was very dirty up on the mountain which surprised me and disappointed me at the same time. Too much litter left......and......the toilet situation was terrible! Not only was it very very smelly the toilet paper was going down the side of the mountain. Terrible!

She lists 5 reasons why Marine Parade GRC voters should vote for The Workers' Party. (Okay she gotta work on her listicle writing skills lol)

http://mustsharenews.com/sylvia-lim-goes-all-buzzfeed/ ","In my opinion, 5 reasons not to vote for WP as follows:
1. Wayang Party (WP) - make a lot of noise at rally but keep quiet in Parliament
2. Flip flop like roti prata, first, your party - Gerald complained about too much foreigners 4 years ago. Now he complained about the u-turn on immigrant policy which is hurting business ?? So what do u all want? Complain everyone can but where is your proposed solution 3? 
3. Like to launch personal attacks on PAP candidates - called LKY a liar and Shanmugan a barking dog - is this ur so called a first world parliament ??
4. Greed for Power - have not shown us results in terms of managing a GRC well yet going after a few more GRCs n SMCs. 
5. Growing Arrogance - see themselves as the best of the best n disregard the other opposition parties - if you can't respect others how do u expect others to respect you$$1. So if we vote for WP, there will be less senseless change? Can the WP stop it?

2. Three bad policies? There's an entire book on his achievements. Go google it.

3. People don't understand or know how difficult it is to persuade anyone to come forward and be a Minister. Having to balance conflicting demands from all sectors of society is an impossible and thankless task. Whoever becomes a Minister will always suffer brickbats because no policy can satisfy everyone. Ask yourself, how many people are willing to put themselves in the firing line knowing they can never satisfy anyone, and they will be flamed no matter what they do. Yes, Chuan-Jin can still contribute in other ways, but how many are willing and able to be a Minister? It is so damn hard lah, please.

4. Accomplished team? I looked up Bernard Chen and he has only worked for only less than one year. And you expect me to believe he can run a town council?? YJJ and the rest have only started to work the ground this year. Previously, only saw YJJ in Joo Chiat and nowhere else. I don't think that's as accomplished as the rest of the MPs who have been here for more than one term.

5. Agree, and national interest to some like me means Vote PAP to make the Opposition work harder!$$WP stop talking nonsense lah... I am not going to vote for you.. my vote goes to PAP.$$So what solutions do u have for the above huh???$$OK....  What actually ARE the 5 reasons ?$$Since when this site became political?

Yay for equality! The Ministry of Social and Family Development is looking to tweak the Women's Charter, and alimony may be on the cards.

Follow Mustsharenews.com for more local news.

http://mustsharenews.com/women-pay-maintenance/Ministry of Social and Family Development is looking to tweak the Women's Charter, and alimony may be on the cards.","Yup. I agree especially since women keep yapping about equal rights.  If you want equal rights, you need to have equal responsibilities also$$Pay and pay. Pay to see children. Brainless. Dumb and dumber.

""... Peter says he is just glad for the time he spends with his child, but the cost of the supervised access sessions is a drain on his finances. He pays almost $200 for a 11/2-hour session. The fees for supervised access cost $108 an hour on weekdays and $130 on weekends.""

""... My ex-wife told my girl that she doesn't have a daddy. She told my daughter to call me 'uncle',"" he said. ""When my ex-wife is around, my daughter would call me uncle. When she's not around, my daughter calls me daddy.""

""... After Peter (not his real name) asked for a divorce, his wife took their baby daughter, returned to her parents' home and refused to let him see the child. She also changed her phone number and cut off all contact with him. Later, she moved out of her parents' home and Peter had no clue how to locate her or his child.""

""... To help safeguard the interests of children, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will have more agencies providing a supervised visitation programme by the end of next year. Currently, only the THK Centre for Family Harmony offers such programmes for separated or divorced parents to see their children.

Some parents deny access to their children to get back at their ex-spouses for various failings. Where visits do happen, some kick up a fuss over the smallest matters, such as if a child is brought home late. Others allege abuse.""

Father is not a visitor. Father is not a weekend babysitter. Father is not a friend that visit on holiday. Father is not a check book/ ATM. Visitation/ supervised visitation is for criminal, NOT father.

#ParentalAlienationSingapore #ParentalAlienation #SingaporeMensFathersRightsMovement #EndGenderBiasFamilyLawMarriageLawWomensCharter #SMFRM$$Gender equality. Women want money, go look for jobs and not look for family court. Men want spousal maintenance, should get a life and continue working.

Ex-spouse cannot feed ex-spouse for life. That's the state's problem: feeding lazy people and vulnerable citizens for life, no?

""... So, it is proposing that maintenance be extended only to a “small group” of men who need support from their wives or ex-wives after they lose the ability to work because of physical or mental disabilities or illness.""

#ParentalAlienationSingapore #ParentalAlienation #SingaporeMensFathersRightsMovement #EndGenderBiasFamilyLawMarriageLawWomensCharter #SMFRM$$Women are still the weaker sex? Women, you voted for these, we do not want to hear any complain for gender discrimination/ gender bias in our Stone Age/ Feudal Era society, no?

#ParentalAlienationSingapore #ParentalAlienation #SingaporeMensFathersRightsMovement #EndGenderBiasFamilyLawMarriageLawWomensCharter #SMFRM$$'Every Singaporean Son', a father is good enough to die for his country.

#ParentalAlienationSingapore #ParentalAlienation #SingaporeMensFathersRightsMovement #EndGenderBiasFamilyLawMarriageLawWomensCharter #SMFRM$$Pay ex-wife $7.5m in 4 weeks or be jailed 8 months - The Straits Times

http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/pay-ex-wife-75m-in-4-weeks-or-be-jailed-8-months

Sep 11, 2015 - 'Pay ex-wife $7.5m in 4 weeks or be jailed 8 months' ... Chief Justice slams businessman worth $14m for his blatant defiance of court order.$$'SINGAPORE Reality check in gender equality' RIP Common Sense, Women Logic, Gender Equality Logic. Maid do housework, homemaker do what?

""... Reality check in gender equality in Singapore. However, given the reality - supported by surveys - that the burden of care for children and the elderly still falls largely on the shoulders of women, current laws remain relevant. Giving a divorced woman maintenance is a way of levelling the playing field for her in a system that devalues her non-market contributions to the marriage. This is the unpaid work at home and the opportunity cost of not having a job and thereby not having the updated skills needed for future employment.""

""... How many foreign domestic workers are there in Singapore? There were 201,000 female domestic workers in Singapore on Work Permits (end of 2010), as reported by the Ministry of Manpower. That made it about one for every five households in the country. In 2002, there were 140,000.""

#ParentalAlienationSingapore #ParentalAlienation #SingaporeMensFathersRightsMovement #EndGenderBiasFamilyLawMarriageLawWomensCharter #SMFRM$$According to the maid, Keryan would spend a week with his mother, then another week with his father. It is believed that Graffart is fighting with his former wife for custody of the boy.

""... Man charged with murder of son, 5. The Belgian expatriate who has been accused of killing his five-year-old son was yesterday remanded for three weeks at the medical complex in Changi Prison for psychiatric evaluation.

Restrained at the wrists, and escorted by plainclothes policemen, 41-year-old Philippe Marcel Guy Graffart arrived at the State Courts in the morning in an unmarked police car looking dazed and tired.

He stood expressionless in the dock as the charge of murdering his boy, Keryan Gabriel Cedric Graffart, was read out.

No plea was taken from Graffart, who was dressed in a black T-shirt and blue shorts. He was observed looking around the public gallery.
None of his family members or friends was in court.

A day before, police had found him with self-inflicted injuries outside Bukit Timah Neighbourhood Police Centre just after 5am.

After he was sent to hospital, police went to his 32nd-storey apartment at the posh D'Leedon condominium in Leedon Heights. There, they found Keryan dead in a bedroom. Hand-shaped bruises were apparently found all over his neck.

According to the charge read to Graffart yesterday, he is accused of killing Keryan in the apartment some time between 8.54pm on Monday and 5.29am on Tuesday...""$$What's the point of feedback? Nobody is listening. MSF probably already have their ""ownself think ownself"" intended changes for women's charter prepared before public consultation. Public consultation is for show only, no?

Our society is still so outdated, still not ready for women to step out of the traditional role of homemaker/ kitchen/ Stone Age/ Feudal Era where men work and women breed? How many family/ household can cope with single income source?

Policy makers keep boiling different soup (family law marriage law women's charter) without changing ingredients?

How many under-utilised educated local women human resources? Women need ""free meal ticket"" from family court or actually need better public resources to help them cope with the family/ kids, so women can go to work and be more financial independent when they grow old/ retired/ divorced?

If women are better living off men, if their primary role in Singapore is to make baby and look after kitchen, why waste public resources educating women in various fields.

Women are still the weaker sex? Women, you voted for these, we do not want to hear any complain for gender discrimination/ gender bias in our Stone Age/ Feudal Era society, no?

SAY YES to 50/50 shared parenting custody care control.

I heard many story/ advise that Family Law has serious concern for children spending 50% of their time with either their father/ mother during custody care control legal tussle?

Family Law has no doubt with children hanging out with stranger in school, stranger in religious organization, daddy's new girlfriend, mummy's new boyfriend, stepdad, stepmom, foster family and other stranger.

There should not be any concern a father or mother to have half of the children time.

Father is not a visitor. Father is not a weekend babysitter. Father is not a friend that visit on holiday. Father is not a check book/ ATM. Visitation/ supervised visitation is for criminal, NOT father.

Stop arguing in family court, waste public resources, time, money fighting for what is yours in the first place. No one get a single cent more or less. Everyone get equal time with your children.

50/50 shared parenting care control custody.
50/50 child support.
Say no to free meal ticket/ spousal alimony/ wife maintenance/ child support to ex-spouse.
Say no to gender bias matrimonial asset distribution.
Say no to parental alienation.

Women want money, go look for jobs and not look for family court. Men want spousal maintenance, should get a life and continue working.

Parental Alienation is act of terrorism hooliganism children kidnapping child abuse child brainwashing. Prosecute and lock up all the Parental Alienator, their collaborator: their facilitator, public officer and social worker that facilitate Parental Alienation Terrorism.

#ParentalAlienationSingapore #ParentalAlienation #SingaporeMensFathersRightsMovement #EndGenderBiasFamilyLawMarriageLawWomensCharter #SMFRM$$2015 October 29. Officially, I can announce my child is PARENTAL ALIENATED ISOLATED HIDDEN KIDNAP BRAINWASH BY PARENTAL ALIENATION TERRORIST when the judge ask me if I want access (interim court order?) to see my children, of course no, why do I need a court order, when I repeatedly ask the judge 3-4 times, am I denied access, NO, I am not denied access by court order, why do I need an court order for access to children if I am not denied access, so why should I negotiate terms and conditions with Parental Alienation Terrorist: their facilitator/ collaborator from the government agency Ministry Of Social Family and Development (MSF)/ MSF registered VWOs.

Rubbish government agency/ VWOs registered with government agency practices? Whoever from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)/ MSF registered VWOs that are facilitating hiding of 6yo minor/ my daughter info WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights) since November 2013, better come clean and admit it.? Not the truth?

Just in case, later I get heart attack, run over by a truck or a construction crane crash on me, someone help continue to keep a journal of #ParentalAlienationTerrorist in Singapore.

I am writing this post to record Parental Alienation Terrorism happening in Singapore/ missing child and these are some of the police reports made (E/20150206/2073, E/20150331/2097, E/20150528/2087, E/20150713/2095, E/20150819/2001, E/20150904/2065, E/20150926/2076, E/20151001/2011, E/20151007/2060, E/20151012/2060, E/20151014/2072).

Whoever from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)/ MSF registered VWOs that are facilitating hiding of 6yo minor/ my daughter info WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights) since November 2013, better come clean and admit it.? Not the truth?

MSF, VWOs or NCSS: their public officer/ social worker are PARENTAL ALIENATION TERRORISM facilitator/ collaborator, revoking father's parental rights custody access care control WITHOUT family court order, facilitating Spouse-A to PARENTAL ALIENATION KIDNAP HIDE ADDUCT ISOLATE ALIENATE children from Spouse-B at unknown location since November 2013. Not the truth?

Singapore Police Force (SPF) latest reply still cannot produce any single evidence that can prove the status (dead, alive or missing) of my daughter, state her whereabout via written reply.

I really have doubt and confidence in SPF handling/ investigating/ response of missing 6yo minor in Singapore.

I will assume my daughter is still missing. Until proven otherwise, police report will continue to be make for missing 6yo minor. Unless there is evidence to prove otherwise, I still do not know or no one can prove where and how is my daughter since November 2013.

Has SPF make any investigation or taken any action against MSF/ MSF registered VWOs that are facilitating hiding of 6yo minor/ 6yo minor's info from her father WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights) since November 2013. They are the last known organisation that are facilitating hiding of a 6yo minor/ my daughter info based on email/ letter correspondence dated in 2014.

If SPF has done their due diligent investigation and concluded that my daughter is safe at a known location, why information of my daughter is not disclosed to me via written reply? Who is facilitating hiding and withholding information of my daughter WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights) from her father? Is this kidnapping/ hiding/ withholding a 6yo minor info from her father in Singapore?

I come back to the same question. I have not received any family court order that I am denied access to information of my daughter? So where is my daughter (dead, alive or missing)? Which government agency/ government registered organisation: MSF/ MSF registered VWOs is facilitating hiding of my daughter (now 6yo minor, missing since 4yo in November 2013), better come clean and admit it.? Is this kidnapping/ hiding/ withholding a 6yo minor info from her father in Singapore WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights)

I got no time/ tolerance/ patience for substandard public service.
Time to expose and shame all these substandard government agency/ government agency registered VWOs practices?

Stop arguing in family court, waste public resources, time, money fighting for what is yours in the first place. No one get a single cent more or less. Everyone get equal time with your children.

50/50 shared parenting care control custody.
50/50 child support.
Say no to free meal ticket/ spousal alimony/ wife maintenance/ child support to ex-spouse.
Say no to gender bias matrimonial asset distribution.
Say no to parental alienation.

Women want money, go look for jobs and not look for family court. Men want spousal maintenance, should get a life and continue working.

Stone Age/ Feudal Era? Men go hunting and women stay in cave? Ironically, we still have family law marriage law women's charter that allow women to ""sit"" at home, while the family financial responsibility fall onto men.

Women's charter can help women to fix lazy men in family court? Men got no marriage law to bring lazy women to family court?

Women don't want to work and pay bill, can ask family court to order men to pay all the bills/ spousal maintenance? Get your free meal ticket/ free money from family court?

Women contribute less monetary to matrimonial asset, yet can claim more money out of matrimonial asset, best deal in the world? Non-monetary contribution as variable to calculate monetary matrimonial asset distribution make no common sense? Women remain married for years can be use as calculation for family contribution, what about men?

Men who want to get married, be prepared, if your marriage soured, you are going to lose your money, children, matrimonial asset that are probably paid by you. Marriage is a sham and lopsided legal contract.

Welcome to #AntiMarriageClub until gender bias family law marriage law women's charter reformed. Let's go viral.

Family Law has no doubt with children hanging out with stranger in school, stranger in religious organization, daddy's new girlfriend, mummy's new boyfriend, stepdad, stepmom, foster family and other stranger. 

There should not be any concern a father or mother to have half of the children time.

Family law marriage law women's charter is broken. A father who is removed from his child's life or given the standard 4 days a month visitation can find a woman with children and play daddy to her kids, meanwhile her children's father is only allowed to see those same kids 4 days a month.

Recap: We have a bunch of children being raised by men who aren't their father whose own kids are being raised by some other men or no father at all, confused yet?

Family Justice Court should have quick one stop service for parental alienation terrorism reporting counter/ e-reporting service, so a duty judge can issue warrant of arrest, so police officer can arrest parental alienation terrorist, their facilitator and collaborator. What do you think?

Parental Alienation is act of terrorism hooliganism children kidnapping child abuse child brainwashing. Prosecute and lock up all the Parental Alienator, their collaborator: their facilitator, public officer and social worker that facilitate Parental Alienation Terrorism.

I will promise my kid, I will keep fighting the law now, so that they never have to fight to see their kid like I did.

The drive to Sekinchan is scenic with oil palm trees along the coastal road, stalls selling handmade cotton pillows, eateries offering a wide variety of local delicacies and almost in the middle of nowhere, vast expanses of paddy fields bordering a stretch of fishing villages.

The picturesque landscape in Sekinchan especially when the sun sets against the vast padi fields and stretch of fishing villages is the one of the many reasons why visitors call this town 'a photographer’s haven'.

The dog issue is a bit complicated.  To be honest, there are almost no acommodations in Korea that would specify themselvs as dog ""friendly"".  And the reason for this is a cultural thing.  Even when Koreans have dogs as pets, they do usually not allow them in their beds and living space.  The idea of living so intimately with dogs is quite strange.  

In most cases, I would say it is better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.  If your dog is not a barker, you might just want to smuggle them in, of course insuring they do not do any damage.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Once reached only on foot after treacherous treks, they are now easily accessible by road. These shrines popularly known as the 'Char Dham', open from mid-May till Diwali, and are visited by thousands of pilgrims, seeking salvation, during the season. 

The shrines and the places on route to them are shrouded in myth that serves to enhance the powerful spiritual influence of the Char Dham.

It is a very exciting action movie! Highly recommended! 👍😍

Sincerely hope to win as a memorable item of this interesting movie!$$first day of opening and i've caught the movie with Sin Ern! woohoo wolverine is our favouritest xmen everrrr! and I LOVE HUGH JACKMAN SO MUCH. so sad that he.. (shant spoil it for those who havent watched). we loved the movie and these merchandise will be our shared memories of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, really make the movie even more memorable for us (:$$Hi thesmartlocal! Pls let me win as I RLY need the replica claw to use as a backscratcher, hair comb, and kitchen knife to cut my toufu. Haha jk tho.. I would really love to win cause I'm a BIG fan of xmen and especially wolverines hairy chest 

Hope to catch this with Soh Yi Ai$$I want to win this so that I can claw my way out when my boss throw me  into a deep pit. It is claw-berring time! :-)

Liked and shared
Tan Ceci Elisa Lee Qi Ng Xuan Nana Lee Ken Ong Ren Jie Chen Richard Tay$$My hubby Edwin Wang watched the preview and enjoyed it. Exciting and thrilling. It will be great to win some merchandise for good memory as afterall is Jack Hughman's last presence as Wolverine.$$As the final chapter for Wolverine's adventures on the big screen or at least for Hugh Jackman, its a definite must see and with such amazing merchandise such as the replica claw, its a great way to remember this final chapter! Thats why I hope to win it, especially the claw! Lets go watch it, Jade Chew$$Because MY TIME HAS COME to win this Bail Eys Low$$i love wolverine and do you know that Wolverine is a man of many names. His birth name is James Howlett. He's commonly known as Logan. To some, he is known as ""Weapon X"". 

I already own the wolverine claw that was used in the movie (the wolverine), and i would love to also win this replicate claw so i can add it to my wolverine collection. Currently i am living with my parents and waiting for HDB to give me my own place.

When i get it, i am going to build a wolverine display so this claw would be displayed nicely in it.

I will be watching it with my wife Shonna Seow :) (pic of my claw)$$I read X-men comics since I was a little boy and I never got tired of it as new mutants keep popping out with their new special mutant ability and I believe that mutants really exists amongst us at that time. However, I'm an adult now and I know mutants exists only in another universe, the cinematic universe that is. However, that does not stop me from admiring Wolverine Aka Logan for his sense of justice and his determination to stand up for the right cause and to defend the weak. He is my idol and I wish to have the Replica claw as a symbol of justice and righteousness and to remind me to be a good person!
Let's watch Logan Jasmine Ong
Liked and shared too!$$I wanna win this Replica claw so badly! I had joined many contests that gave out the replica claws in the past few wolverine or X-men movies but without success. This Replica Claw from Logan might not be the last one as X-men movies will likely carry on for another few decades but it will be the last chance for me to own a replica claw that is used by wolverine played by Hugh Jackman. I wish to own one of the Replica Claw as a tribute to Hugh Jackman aka Wolverine and to remember him for playing the role  my favourite mutant all these years! I would like to watch Logan with Sit Ting Wen as this will be the final time Hugh Jackman will act as Wolverine!
liked and shared too!$$I want to win this giveaway because its very sad that this is Hugh Jackman's last movie for wolverine, so I hope to win this as my consolation prize to cheer me up a little and keep this as a memory that he is the best actor for Wolverine! <3 Gonna see with Julin Chua hehehe$$Hoping to win as I love all things X-Men and of all the characters, I always have a soft spot for Wolverine as he is the coolest and most loyal of all the mutants!! Keeping my fingers crossed!!! Liked and shared with Evelyn Tan$$have seen all the reviews for LOGAN and they've all been amazing (not surprised). truly can't wait to watch Hugh Jackman's final portrayal of Wolverine, it's the end of a great era and winning this (especially the t-shirt!) would make this film even more memorable for me :-)$$I want to win this giveaway as this is the last time that Hugh Jackman will be appearing on screen as Wolverine, so I want to have something to remember that this phenomenal actor once acted in such a great role. 

I will frame up the memento if it's the claws and wear it if it's the T-shirt! Hopefully it's the claws!

Would love to watch this with Theng Siong!$$I have been collecting wolverine items for years and I need this in my collection! It's something I definitely wanna get my claws on especially when it is also the very representation of Hugh Jackman's work on Wolverine! I'm definitely catching LOGAN with MicHelle Ang Xing Yee!$$I want this! The Replica Claw would be a perfect display at our new flat! This will make our entertainment room look outstanding! 😍😍 Love wolverine! Love X-men! Mike Lin and I will definitely be catching LOGAN! #HisTimeHasCome$$I liked Wolverine movies and XMen. Hugh Jackman would have agree too!! It is sad to see  this great character portray by Hugh Jackman to be his last of XMen Series. I hope to have his Replica Claw for souniver and make an enrage X claw pose. Alex Chew Wei Xiong$$Love xmen since childhood . Most of all my Favourite hero is wolverine ! Love his self healing abilities and not to mention his sharp razor claws ! 

Collecting its figurines, posters and collectables is my daily life routine. Never ever miss out the movies of xmen since it's debut.

What's more now I have the chance to own the exclusive claw which is like a once in a life time opportunity for me. 

It is not a want now. It's time for a need of this to add on to my collection and be part of my Favourite hero adventure !

Definitely catching it with Aaron Phoa over and over again !$$This is Jack Hughman's last outing as Wolverine so it would be memorable to win these movie premiums. 

Liked and shared! (Y) Elaine Chang$$Growing up, Wolverine was one lengendary character with a complicated storyline. This continuation of his story is something I would like to see! Amalus Barakna$$I want to win the Replica claw because it looks so cool and shiny! Logan is my favourite mutant as being a woman , I loved cooking and hence I dig knifes. So for Logan to have the claws coming out from his knuckles whenever he have a rage , it makes my heart flutter😶! This will be a unique and the centre of attention  piece among the collections of my kitchen knifes!

Let’s find out why they are said like this.
Maybe one of reasons is using natural material cosmetics in a daily life.

Tsubaki oil (camellia-seed oil) used since 7th century, is effective in moisturizing and cutting off ultraviolet rays. Not only women use, sumo wrestlers use it to tie up their hair, and kabuki actors use it as their make-up base. 
Azuki bean has been used as skincare among upper class ladies from the ancient time. It accelerates blood flow, therefore it is good for getting rid of pimples and smoothing your skin. 
Komenuka (rice bran) is highly praised for its effect on beautifying skin. Its vitamins remove spots and works for anti-aging. 

For your information, cosmetics will be one of the tax-free products since this October.
It would be wonderful to buy Japanese cosmetics that suit your skin condition.

Then would visit Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon which is a more advanced representation of his time, also visit Gyeongju which is the capital of a dynasty that ruled the Korean peninsula for many years, then go to the Historical Complex Gyengju to contemplate large relics which is very impressive that still have an excellent state of preservation, then go to the Grotto and Bulguksa Seokguram Buddhist temple which dazzles me for its architecture, art and beauty of his nature also feel very relaxed by the great harmony and energy to be surrounded by great nature !!! and then go to the Yangdong Folk Village, Gyeongju and Hanoe Folk Village in Andong and appreciate traditional Korean houses !!! which dazzle me by the way he is love !!!!

Celebrations are carried out on November 15th or the month of November for boys who reach the age of 3 or 5, or for girls who turn 3 or 7 years old. The custom is for the children to dress in their best clothes and to carry “Chitose-ame” which are long thin candy sticks colored in red and white, believed to bring good luck.

Tubbataha Reef, Palawan

What is it like? 
Schooling is when a group of fish swim together in one direction. They do this to fend off predators by creating a ""confusion effect,"" where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

Fun Fact: 
Shoaling is different from schooling. Shoaling is when a group of fish is grouped closed together, but each one is swimming independently. . Tubbataha has 600 species of fish that either school or shoal.

Sikkim is sheer magic. This is not just one of the most beautiful places in the world but the cleanest and safest too. If once the charms of the state were limited to mists, mountains and colourful butterflies, they are now complimented by tangible development and progress. With its unique culture and natural landscape, Sikkim is a picture of perfection and pristine purity. 

Nestled in the Himalayas and endowed with exceptional natural resources, Sikkim is a hotspot of biodiversity and development. This state has the unique distinction of being bounded by three sovereign nations: Nepal in the west, Bhutan in the east and China’s Tibet in the north.

This just in - you can visit Dubai on holiday WITHOUT eating grass for the month. Did you know airfares cost just $383 and 5-star hotels cost less than $200/night? 

That's even cheaper than a vacation to Tokyo! 

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/budget-dubaiDubai is dubbed the city of dreams for good reason, and here's how you can explore this captivating city for under S$1,000!","If you are there for a shopping spree, head down there just before hari raya. They usually have a massive sales on the already competitive retail pricing. e.g. 1 belt from armani exchange can cost as much as 140 SGD, over there its just slightly over 80 SGD factoring in the exchange rate on an average day. 2 biggest mall, Dubai mall and mall of emirates. u can easily spend an entire day in each mall due to the massive landscape and plethora of shops. 

Point 7, if you are opting for the dune bashing, it is priced differently by the location and experience. I went for the more expensive package and its worth every penny. Dont scrimp on this and short change urself on the experience when u have endure a grueling 7+ hrs flight to there. 

Burj Khalifa is too beautiful to give it a miss. Book and reserve ur tickets online as it is often sold out. Its linked to the dubai mall and u can have ur shopping there. If u r interested, the aquarium is also in the mall. 

Weather is harsh and you will consume alot of water. Go grab the 10 liter pack to ur room and refill ur personal bottle from the 10 liter pack. Most hotels provide free maps for tourist in their lobby. Gold souk, spice souk and Dubai museum are within the walking distances from metro station. Dont take the taxi as not all their drivers are honest and being stranger to the place, they can take u for a roundabout ride with the meter rocketing and no one is the wiser.

One of the hotel I stayed before Avenue Hotel. Near to the metro for traveling and with plenty of brochures in their lobby for activities to embark on in dubai for tourist.$$Point 1: u can cut down ur cost by going for 3 stars hotel if u just need a place to crash for the night instead of having a luxury slp over. There are plenty of hotels to choose from and some of them even throw in the breakfast and WiFi into the package. Choose one that is within walking distance from the metro and u will have an easier time travelling around

Point 3: their metro is not like our mrt system and is abit confusing. They cluster a few stations into one zone. When u are buying ur ticket to board the metro, the fare is charged by zones instead of stations. Point to note, if u get a single zone ticket, u can travel to any stn within that zone for a trip. On the next trip, u can just top up this ticket and board the train to the next stn within the zone. But if you wanna travel to stns within other zones, u need to get a 2 zone ticket and this means additional costs. If I recall correctly, they have different charges for single zone or multiple zone ticket for travelling, so it might be wiser to look up more info on this when planning ur trip$$Ifah Majeed reading abt DXB and i got reminded of you!$$Angela Simon - this looks more fun.

You will be definitely fascinated if you actually seeing these magnificent views.
And there are many ways to enjoy it. For example, watching from the deck of tower, at restaurants and bars in skyscrapers…
Or perhaps you can be taking on a cruise as viewing on ocean or from a helicopter in the sky!  Depend on locations, Dynamic scenery from Ferris wheel or roller coaster would be a good choice too!

A lot of traditional villages can be found scattered throughout the rice terraces. Visit the Tam-an, Bocos, Batad, and Bangaan villages to immerse in the culture of this region.

How to get there: 
Take a bus bound for Banaue from Sampaloc. 

Or take a bus bound for Baguio from Cubao or Pasay, then transfer to a bus bound for Banaue.

Fun Fact: 
If you were traveling in the Philippines, you’d most likely be carrying the Banaue Rice Terraces in your pocket. The image of the site can be found at the back of the new P20 bill.

This figure, however, does not include those who indirectly benefit from the influx of travellers in their destinations. Take the case of a boatman from Carles, Iloilo whose story is told by Eric James Sotomil (@callmejames007).

""As the engine roared at the beginning of our 2-hour boat ride from Estancia to Isla Gigantes, so did the stories of our boatman. I conversed with him in Hiligaynon and and he shared how Typhoon Yolanda ravaged northern Iloilo: After Yolanda, my family was able to bounce back because of steady tourist arrivals. I can't rely solely on fishing because of fishing bans between November and February every year. My income as a guide helps send my daughter to school.

Here's one of Korea’s leading fusion dishes - Western ingredients such as ham and sausage mixed with kimchi, rice cakes and hot pepper paste. If you're a fan of this dish, there is a street known as the 'Uijeongbu Budaejjigae Street' near Seoul that is home to an entire stretch of budaejjigae restaurants. *Yumm*

Boracay is becoming dirty and over crowded, again what is being done by the government to better the place for tourist other than the airport? - None

Cebu - are there any developments there? 

I bet we can do better
There is huge potential in Tourism we should better our infrastructure to boost tourism in the country which can generate jobs.

If you look at other SEA neighbors they have long been enjoying the benefits of tourism - Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Indonesia even Singapore is getting millions of tourist every year!

Singapore having known as tiny and no natural resources is getting plenty of them!

Sanchi’s stupas, monasteries, temples and pillars dating from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The most famous of these monuments, Stupa 1, known as the Great Stupa, was originally built by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, the then governor of Ujjayini, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant from the adjacent town of Vidisha. Their son Mahindra and daughter Sanghamitra were born in Ujjayini and sent to Sri Lanka, where they converted to king, the queen and their people to Buddhism.

The Sanchi hill goes up in shelves with Stupa 2 situated on a lower shelf, Stupa 1, Stupa 3, the 5th century Gupta Temple No.17 and the 7th century temple No. 18 are on the intermediate shelf and a later monastery is on the crowning shelf. The balustrade surrounding Stupa 2, carved with aniconic representations of the Buddha, was added in the late 2nd century BC under the Satavahanas.

The adjacent Gupta temple no.17 was hailed by Sir John Marshall as one of the most rationally organized structures in Indian architecture. Though small, it was a herald of all the principles which went into the engineering of an Indian temple in the early medieval period. The Buddhas in the perambulatory surrounding Stupa 1 are not contemporary with the Stupa but belong to the Gupta period in the mid-5th century AD. The monastery and the temple with the tall pillars adjacent to Stupa 1 and the temple near the monastery on the crowning shelf illustrate the evolution of the architectural form after the 5th century Gupta temple.

Your 1rst place rank has seemed strange to me from the outset.  page views don't necessarily equal a vote, as anytime a friend posts your itenerary to their facebook page you get a point and I have a LOT of friends, So,please do not attack or question me, unless you want to be investigated yourself.  I also think offering to ""give"" something to the KTO is known as a bribe and might, accoring to most contest rules disqualify you.  My motivation is not self interest, as yours seems to be, but a motivation for my wife and my 2 kids to see their grandparents and extended family in Korea.$$We really understand that everyone is passionate about this contest and can appreciate your concern, but please be assured that scores will be tallied in a fair, unbiased manner.
