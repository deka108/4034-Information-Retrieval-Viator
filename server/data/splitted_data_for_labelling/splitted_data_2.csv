Water is so central to Angono life that during the town's yearly festival, fishermen hang their catch near the image of the town's patron saint.

Model: Symone Maria Oei ","Went once out of curiosity and never going again for multiple reasons.

Dogs are very food-motivated. So dont expect any of them to pay you much attention unless you are willing to fork out extra for a pack of treats to bribe them into giving you some affection. (No promise they'll give you much either. Given how often they get to chow down on them.)

Secondly, animals need time to grow accustomed to you. When I visited, a regular stepped in and immediately all the pups darted towards her.üôÅ All the other people there had no choice but to sit in the corner and sorta just watch from afar. Not pleasant. But nothing we could do about it either.

After one experience I figured it'd be much more worthwhile to volunteer at an animal shelter to interact with pups who desperately want and deserve love too. (And will likely much more willingly give you love.)

Having a dog myself, I know how much stress dogs can relieve and how affectionate they can be. Dogs are great. But dont exploit them.
Putting them in an environment like this spoils them to the core and will deteriorate their character in the long run.

Edit: Try visiting Mutts and Mittens instead.‚ò∫Ô∏è$$Basically u need to buy treats in order for the dog to stay by ur side for u to touch and interact... If not u will be just wasting money ($10.90 entrance fee) and time there looking at the dogs walking by... I rather go to my relatives and friends house to interact with their dogs (no treats needed) and relieve stress there...$$I don't like the idea of buying treats from the shop in order to attract the doggies. Too much treats are bad for dogs. And are the treats healthy? Eg, dehydrated treats, home made treats etc?$$Just go visit a dog shelter and donate food to the dogs that really need your love and attention. Crappy cafe that exploits animals sucks$$why support this kind of cafe who use animals to make money? There are many dog shelter whose dogs needed more love and attention. Also imagine these pedigree dogs are like clowns waiting to be stuffed with treats...you think it is healthy to be eating treats all the time?$$YueKit Kwan entrance fee is like $10.90/2hrs ($7.90/hr extra) and if you dont buy treats, the dog wont even let you pet them.
Treats itself aldy cost $3/pack and $9 for 4packs. Even if you go there many times, people who bought the treat will always get the dogs attention. So, buy it or leave it.$$The dogs there are not friendly , i almost got hurt when i trying to pet one , me and my boyfriend just go there waste our time and play some games they provided.... 

Ps: even dog shelters or SPCA dogs are friendly to let you pet........ this is shit.....they shld train the dogs more$$I went there once with my boyfriend, bought 2 packets of treats and the dogs still didn't  give a flying f* about us LOL. They took the treats, moved away when we tried to pet them and walked away once we stop feeding. üòÖ Not worth a visit in our opinion.....$$With or without treats it's
really hard to get the dogs to come to you. Lola is one dog that had bad experiences with strangers who just carry her without basic respect of being gentle. You gotta be some kind of God blessed dog whisperer to really have fun. I wasted my $25 though. The pinch is real.$$Went there once. Yes the dogs mostly give you attention if you have treats, but after awhile when they get sleepy they'll crawl into the first person's lap they see, and they pretty much stay there and snooze till you need to move your numbed legs$$Omg why the hate for this place. These are DOGS. They obviously will be treats motivated. Don't worry abt the dogs being overfed. The owners calculate the packs of treats at the end of the day and feed them accordingly. None of them are overweight despite this cafe being opened for years so yea obviously something is being done right.get the pups to do tricks for their food, they are super cute and smart. 

I go there often and I see people grabbing the tiny pups and forcing them to take selfies w them üôÑ do u think that these pups are going to be v fond of u?? Be gentle with them and naturally some of them will be drawn to u. I personally have no trouble luring one or two dogs to snooze/play w me (ps Lulu is a sweet heart ‚ù§Ô∏è) just be patient and visit more often hahaha. 

WTF if ur reading this, please please please come up w yearly membership price üòÇI would totes buy it ‚úåüèªÔ∏è$$The first and only time I visited, most of the dogs were being hogged by some visitors (sleeping on their laps for almost the entire time I was there). So you just end up looking at them and the few dogs left walking around who will mostly ignore you unless you have treats. Waste of money.$$Bad experience there after just one visit. Went there on my birthday but I was sorely disappointed because the dogs do not come to you unless the staff gives u some treats. Extremely boring. Expect to be sitting around looking at the dogs from afar if u do go. I'd much rather go to the local dog shelters where the dogs welcome anyone, regardless of treats.$$lol Prerna Wangnoo i just read the comments and i think u shld just come and meet my dog instead... i charge u half the entrance fee and don't even need treats my dog will fly to u!

When Mt.Vulcan erupted in 1870, it covered areas of Camiguin in lava and ashes and even caused a cemetery to sink in the ocean. Hundreds of years later, a huge cross was built to mark the graveyard's underwater location.

Fun Fact: 
If you want to see the cross up close, you only have to pay 50 US cents to get there by boat.

Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.


Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name ‚ÄúBantayan sa Hari‚Äù (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to ‚ÄúBantayan,‚Äù the name it's known as today.

I didn't know he's actually quite fond of the Philippines and her people.

Vists the Filipinos learn about the country$$The majority of the Filipinos are awesome people, but just like any other country, they have corrupt government officials.$$It's an incredible country with incredible people.  There is so much I can write about them but all I can say is, how wonderful to see another episode on this country.$$Dear leaders of the Philippines!
Offers its program to restore the water balance of the Philippines, and the elimination of surface and underground earthquakes.
In the Philippines, will be carried out work on the restoration of rivers and ground and underground reservoirs in the level and purity. This will increase the productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, increase in agricultural and meat dairy products), and the cultivation of new forests arrays.
Finally, and most importantly, what needs to be done immediately.
Philippines - a country of many mountain formations. Mountain formation and adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates were many thousands of years in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And such or similar joints in the Philippines and around - many dozens.
Quote: ""The area of the Philippines is located in the zone of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, and even the coast of the Philippines is a zone of subduction, where oceanic crust is turned in under the mainland. subduction zone is also called the Benioff zone, because it has the largest number of deep earthquakes. ""
""In the Philippines, for the year on average, there is more than 35 earthquakes (on average by 3 earthquakes per month) magnitude of 5.0 - 5.9, one earthquake of magnitude 6.0 - 6.9 or 7.0 - 7.9, then this country can be considered one of the most seismically active areas in the world. ""
Physics. The warming heats the surface and underground rock formations of the Philippines. By law, all of physics solid crystalline formations expands when heated, destroying themselves and the surrounding formation, and form of the earthquake and tsunami.
The scheme is simple to prevent earthquakes.
My program is cooled all the big and small rivers. Rivers carry cooled water into the surrounding body of water Philippines, cooled water, rock formations both on land and at sea, to prevent the appearance of surface and submarine earthquakes and tsunamis.
During 7 years - 15% in a year - I chilled all rock formations to the level of 1980. There basting to reduce the damage from the hurricane, the theme of excess current, but it is still in operation.
One technology - ""Ladder"", which explains the principle of cooling rock formations, tectonic and lithospheric plates - I'm sending you. But it is more suitable for hospitals, schools, and kindergartens, and partially cools the water area around the Philippines. At the prompt, I'll bring the technology is three times more powerful than the ""Ladder"".

We respect your opinion regarding this list. We know that there are others equally deserving of this title. This post was meant to celebrate Filipino pride from all industries, regardless of whether the person was born/raised in the Philippines or not. Hope that clarifies things! :)$$The list itself doesn't bother me, but the title definitely does! One could so easily come up with a much better list of ""27 Filipinos who make you proud to be Pinoy""!!! Filipinos who actually consider themselves Filipino!!!

The question of Philippine identity and colonial mentality is worth examining further. I find it ironic that #21 Jose Antoniio Vargas, is famous for launching the website and movement DEFINE AMERICAN, in which he argues that being American is not about your citizenship or legal status in the US, it is about whether you consider yourself an American, which he does. I respect his right to define his own identity, which makes it all the more ironic to find him listed here.

So the question is, how do you DEFINE FILIPINO? From this list, apparently, one doesn't have to even ever have been to the Philippines, speak the language, or in any way claim Philippine identity and culture as your own, it is sufficient to have a Philippine ancestor (no matter how distant) somewhere on your family tree?

I understand that the list is meant as a bit of fun, but the title warrants more serious examination.  No offense to anyone who is a fan of those on that list...

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what‚Äôs around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to development in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into 
knowing existence.$$Dt 22-01-2016   Hello Friends & Family's   üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥  üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ  üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥   üåûüåûüåû !!!

Bijapur experienced a great burst of architectural activity under the Adil Shahi rulers. It is also famous for the hand-made sarees of llkal. Bijapur is also the best base from which to see other exceptional heritage sites such as Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal.

Marie$$Hi Gregory.  It was brought to my attention that my comment appears to call your photos ""garbage"".  However, the comment was directed at my own photos which I provided a link to.  

At the time, I shot in JPEG, something you know limits ones ability to make edits.  Also, I edited the photos with Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006, a weak editing program.  Furthermore, I used zero sharpening.  Thus, my photos are undeniably ""garbage"" compared to what they could be.  I still have the original JPEGs, so I plan to go back and use Capture NX2 and re-do the whole process.

Sorry for the confusion.  I wouldn't call another person's work ""garbage"" unless they asked for an honest opinion from me and I truly felt that way.  

I hope everyone has a nice day.$$Hi Eddie, Thanks a lot for the clarification :). I think your photos feature Hahoe Villages houses quite nicely.

Do you like rice, but don‚Äôt own a rice cooker? No need to worry, you can cook rice in a pot!
First, wash the rice and place in a pot. Add water (rice to water ratio is 1: 1.2) and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it is boiling, cover with lid and let simmer for 12-15 minutes over low heat. Remove the pot from heat (with the lid still on) and let steam for another 10 minutes.

Mabuhay kayong lahat!$$Has he a permanent residency visa in the Philippines? We Filipinos should be vigilant about the residency status of foreigners wherever they are in our shores. Let us not be fascinated alone by what beautiful words they say about the Philippines.$$Keep reading on, or die tonight a exactly
12:42. This
is based on a TRUE STORY! Once there
was
a baby
girl named Marry. Her mother couldn't
take
all the
crying, so she decided it was time for her
to
go. She
buried her baby alive in her back yard.
After she
buried her she could still hear Marry
crying.
So she dug her back up and stabbed her
one
time in the arm,
and buried her again. Marry cried harder,
but a few
hours later it stopped. At exactly 12:42,
Marry died.
She bleed to death. Now her sprite
haunts
the
world. When your sleeping, she stabs
you in
the
arm and watches you bleed to death.
And
that's how she got the name ""Bloody
Marry"" this is the true story
of her. She wants everyone to feel her
pain
that she
felt. Apparently, if you re-post This isn't
fake.
Apparently, if you copy and paste this to
ten
comments in the next ten minuets you
will
have the
best day of your life tomorrow. You will
either get kissed or asked out, if you
brake
this chain you will
see a little dead girl in your room tonight.
In the next
53 minuets someone will say I love you
or
I'm sorry
to 12 other comments you will have the
best day of
your life tomorrow. But if you break this
chain you die
at exactly 12:42 tonight by Bloody Marry.

My boyfriend is an avid flyer (SO avid that he can tell you the exact engine codes once he hears an airplane fly past. No kidding.), and his dream has always been to be a pilot himself. Though he hasn't been able to do so, he loves all things to do with planes and coming on this trip would give us the perfect opportunity to extend our stay and engage this pilot!

The stay period has to be in the month of September 2016.
PSA over!$$To all TSL readers who have tried to participate in this flash sale - here's a recent update from Expedia's Facebook page for those who may have missed it. (https://www.facebook.com/Expedia.com.sg/)

------------------------
Expedia: ""We are sorry that this situation has happened. The problem occurred due to an unexpected glitch coupled with high traffic. It's not a situation we are happy about. 

We are sincerely sorry about this. We are working on a solution and will update you all again later this afternoon.""
------------------------

We've worked with Expedia before and we've used Expedia ourselves many times - so we believe they'll be able to come up with a good solution soon.

They are now doing their best to resolve this and they'll be posting an official statement later this afternoon.$$Give them a break. We are humans after all. This may be a lesson to be learn by their Marketing Department to always do a dummy test out before going live on such technical IT glitch. 

Hang in there @Expedia & TheSmartLocal.com hope that the matter resolves soon. Xoxo$$Hi all, we're sorry that the situation has happened. We are continuing to fix the problem and will update here once the sale is resumed.

Thanks for your patience and understanding.$$there is no mystery room to select?$$Tan Pamela Just FYI I'm going to try for this! For Sep 17/18 hah.$$will anyone who actually got the room please comment here, because i'm starting to believe that this was all just a ploy to get people to download the app lol.$$Its been 20 mins and yet still the same. Any updates on this issues?

Error Stated:
1) Sorry, your voucher cannot be applied to the booking
2) Sorry, but the average price per night doesnt meet the minimum requirement

Did you gave us the wrong Promo Code? Or just a sham to download Expedia?

You tell us to restart the app. But if i do, can you guarantee that i can get the promo?

Dear Expedia, I download your app just for the promo, and it turns out this way.... üòî$$What a low class way to encourage people to download expedia for a shot of try , no worries you've betray majority of your customer trust . Wont be even keeping the app anymore$$You guys have a lot to explain. Those who stayed up till late did not get it because of your error and had to restart the app over and over again, and now someone else who just logged in manage to get away with the sale.... This is one scam!

Now how should I explain to my wife that her 10 years anniversary gift was just a scam?

Goodbye Expedia! Hello again Booking.com & Agoda!$$It's a scam.. Been trying since 12.00am till 12.45am but the error code is still the same.. Called Expedia but they said the 50 rooms r taken, n they can only book the room for me without the promo code.. Just a gimmick to get users to
Download their app..$$Tried 1 hr 6 mins and called expedia as well! Guess it's a scam. #thesmartlocal has some explaining to do first thing in the morning you reach office!$$For your own sake, you had better distance yourself from Expedia. This fiasco that Expedia has generated has angered hundreds including myself. From their lies and horrendous management, to their mishandling of the relaunch, they have disappointed, disgusted, and infuriated all of us. Be smart, the locals aren't happy.$$Read the T&C, it says coupon value: $255 off hotel booking (‚ÄúDiscount‚Äù). One night is $255 before tax/surcharge but when proceed to payment and keyed in the code, it says  ""sorry, but the average price per night doesn't meet the minimum for this voucher"". It doesn't work, what a waste of time. Just to con you to download Expedia.$$BE CAREFUL everyone! Expedia shamelessly charged the room to my credit card, and at a room rate 50% percent higher than what every hotel booking website is selling at. The hotel Duty Manager has confirmed that the hotel has received my booking as complimentary stay, no reason why Expedia should charge me. Countless attempts to call & email Expedia over the last 4 days, got no help. My top 3 reasons for you to stop using Expedia are: (1) Their Marketing, IT, Call Centre don't speak to each other. Serious disintegration of a company. (2) Call Centre (for SG) is based in New Delhi. I spoke to 4 different Indian call centre agents, they have no idea about promo, cannot solve my problem. (3) Unstable technology. Guys, don't leave your holiday plans to a company like Expedia whose technology could screw you up. When you need customer service support, you need to deal with problem solvers, not programmed robots. Any problems out of their programmed capabilities, good luck, you're on your own! #BoycottExpedia$$Doesn't work at all. On Sunday - Mon stays it's ""unknown error"" and for other days the voucher code cannot be used because minimum average price is not met. It's a scam to get the app download numbers up.$$I can find the hotel,can proceed  all the way till they voucher code give me problem."" Amount is insufficient for the promn..blah blah"" . Is there anyone who has succeeded in claiming? Lol$$Not working at all. Average price per night doesn't meet the min requirement, and yet t&c state only can book one night per user..... :($$Either this is an elaborate, and counter effective, marketing scam, or the programmers are just plain stupid. Don't exactly know which is worse.$$Sorry smartlocal for spamming here. I know it's not your fault. Felt so guilty for complaining and defaming about the flashsale event! üòêüòêüòê$$ok.. so it not only me having this problem and it a scam. going to uninstall ...i guess i still stick to Hotels.com$$We are sorry that this situation has happened.

Ladies and gentlemen.
I am the developer of environmental programs, and in particular for the production of fresh drinking and irrigation water, its purification and cooling.
If you have interest in my program in the Philippines will be restored all the rivers, and land, and underground reservoirs in the level and purity. This will increase the productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, increase in agricultural and meat dairy products), and forest tracts.
Finally, and most importantly, what needs to be done immediately.
Philippines - a country of many mountain formations. Mountain formation and adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates were many thousands of years in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And such or similar joints in the Philippines and around - many dozens.
Quote: ""The area of the Philippines is located in the zone of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, and even the coast of the Philippines is a zone of subduction, where oceanic crust is turned in under the mainland. subduction zone is also called the Benioff zone, because it has the largest number of deep earthquakes. ""
""In the Philippines, for the year on average, there is more than 35 earthquakes (on average by 3 earthquakes per month) magnitude of 5.0 - 5.9, one earthquake of magnitude 6.0 - 6.9 or 7.0 - 7.9, then this country can be considered one of the most seismically active areas in the world. ""
Physics. The warming heats the surface and underground rock formations of the Philippines. By law, all of physics solid crystalline formations expands when heated, destroying themselves and the surrounding formation, and form of the earthquake and tsunami.
The scheme is simple to prevent earthquakes.
My program is cooled all the big and small rivers. Rivers carry cooled water into the surrounding body of water Philippines, cooled water, and mountain formation, prevent the appearance of surface and submarine earthquakes and tsunamis.
For 10 years the ecology of the Philippines will be restored to the level of 1980. There basting to reduce the damage from the hurricane, the theme of excess current, but it is still in operation.

First, the place where the sumo is held has so much presence that you can see almost all the audience, hear the cheers for the wrestlers, and definitely tell who the popular wrestler is! 
Second, you can feel the solemnity of Japanese traditional sport, but at the same time there's much excitement during fights!

CCP, Manila

What is it? 
The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) is the premiere showcase of the arts in the country. Founded in 1969 under the Marcos regime, it still continues to hold the most celebrated and award-winning plays from around the world. At night, it's therapeutic to watch the fountain lightshow ‚Äî a colorful oasis by the side of the main road, in the middle of a busy metro.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact:

Hongmen reservoir, built in 1958, is located on the ruins of the ancient Xiaoshi Township, which was an important trade center and hub for water transportation between Jiangxi and Fujian provinces. 

The statue was somewhat preserved in the water, which prevented weathering. Archaeologists will continue research for the protection of the reservoir's underwater relics.

Nothing can stop me from being fit and keeping a healthy lifestyleÔøΩ$$I'm interested in the Cardio Fitness Level mode because I have started to resume my workouts recently, but I feel that my stamina is really really bad compared to years ago and I'll like to see what level it is at now to have a better judgement of the execises I should be pushing myself to do :)$$Definitely most excited to use the continuous heart rate monitor (HRM) on the Fitbit Charge 2. Till now, Fitbit is the only HRM I can find, that stores heart rate data at 1 second intervals during exercise tracking and at 5 second intervals all other times. Other HRMs usually measure continuous heart rate every few minutes. Fitbit's higher frequency should result in more accurate resting heart rate (RHR) figures, which can be an indicator of your overall health. The lower your RHR, the better. :)$$I am most excited to use the Cardio Fitness Level!!!

This allows me to know where I stand as I make changes to improve over time.$$I love the fact that you can switch between the different modes, allowing you to be able to keep track of which activities you're doing specifically! Best part is that it comes with 5 different faces for the watch portion, allowing you to pair it with daily wear seamlessly.$$The most exciting function i would like to use would be the Cardio Fitness Level as I could get a better understanding of my fitness level and see how I could improve over time with a personalized Cardio Fitness Score.

Dubbed as the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines, its deep waters teem with marine life and an abundance of corals and reefs. For non-divers ‚Äì the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

Fun Fact: 
Diving conditions in Anilao are ideal for divers of all experience levels. The water temperature is consistently warm, and the surface is typically calm and smooth throughout the year.

In truth, there is still a shortage of hospital beds and may or may not be solved even after the announced hospitals are built (Sengkang General Hospital for example) because these are geared more towards a 6.9 million population planning!!!

So the right thing for ALL young people should be:

1) Getting a private shield plan that is fully payable by Medisave (Except riders, so some savings in cash is still needed)

2) Medisave will only capped at $49,800 in 2016 and increase it annually as needed. 

Excess will be parked at Special Account.

But given that an average uni grad starts to work at 25 at 2015, in 30 yrs time with an annual average inflation of 3%, the CPF Minimum Sum would be around $390,000 by the time reach 55.

BUT, your CPF LIFE payout is only $1,200 since currently the CPF LIFE payout has no provision for inflation adjusted payout.

In then's terms, it is about $495 in 2015 value.

So in short, there is no incentive to park the money in Medisave, and one gets better benefits in a Class A or even private Hospital, most importantly is about securing a hospital bed!!!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Not long ago, the internet found out about a place called Khao Yai. We made a trip there to see it for ourselves, and this magical land lived up to every bit of the hype. 

Take your pick from a hobbit's house, a caravan, or a quaint town that has been Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V from Italy. Here's a complete guide to Khao Yai.

The decorations were destroyed by local people trying to sell stuffs not local in Italy and the feeling was just like... Italy was ruined...
Hope my friend still did not sell his resort there so I can go visit for free.

FYI Khao Yai is not a town, it's the national park.

Please stop breaking down MRT!

http://mustsharenews.com/causes-of-train-breakdowns/Why do our trains break down? Find out here.","The infrastructure is not catered for 5.9 million population. In any time. Excess of 30% moving in peak hour will inadvertently crush the transport system. System will stressed whether the company do the maintenance is another thing. Lapses occur and now busy fixing it. Will it work? Time will tell.$$More to come...6.9m then 10m...$$The real problem is that the older main MRT lines have not been created with redundant tracks. Meaning you cannot fix any line without shutting down the line. 

This is why the MRT is not open 24/7. 6 hours in the early morning is devoted to maintenance. This is also why the newer lines have a third track. 

But for the original red and green lines, any kind of long term shut down is unthinkable because so much of our transport now revolves around the MRT. And yet any strategic overhaul of a rail system of our size requires at least 6 months. And the infrastructure is getting older and older.

She did not want to lose neither her beauty nor the youth. She wanted them forever that she went to shrine to ask for a help. ‚ÄúGuanyin‚Äù(enlightenment being in Buddhism) suggested her to drink water of the lake as much as possible. She kept drinking with suffer, gradually, she turned into ‚Äútatsu‚Äù (dragon). Since then, she started living in the Lake. Her husband experienced the same thing in the northern lake.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/photogenic-mrtOpen your eyes, on your daily commute and you‚Äôll realise our train stations can be pretty cool. Instagram-worthy, even. Check out these 10 stations the next time you take the train!","I especially love Bras Basah MRT Station's glass ceilings. Every time I happen to be there, I always get tricked by the ceilings thinking that it is raining outside.$$I love Choa Chu Kang MRT the most, it's the station that I alight home and also the station that I leave home. Each time people talk about Choa Chu Kang MRT, it makes me feel proud of where I am staying at. Also, each time after returning from camps or overseas and when I alight at Choa Chu Kang MRT, it makes me feel home again. Furthermore, that is also the place where I meet my long-ago friends that I made during my primary and secondary school days, it's like a hot spot that I alight saying ""hi"" and ""bye"" but still feel that ""I'll see you again"".$$Dhoby Ghaut gets my vote due to the beautiful coloured tiles and the amazing 3D effect! Can't wait to refresh my wardrobe with this win!$$I think I will choose Rochor MRT Station. The design of black & white (a never out-dated colours)stripes look cool and unique like filming of the movies star wars.$$Liked and shared! 
My favourite would be Stadium MRT. It is a cool, unique, well designed stadium with splendid scenery around it. It really stands out even when there is no crowds.$$I ‚ù§Ô∏è Stadium MRT because the architect cleverly makes use of natural light to effectively illuminate the station, providing cost effective way to light up the station. 
I also like the slight darker theme which is stark contrast against the ceiling and the tiling... I think it's minimalistic yet elegant üòä
Liked and shared üëç$$it's gotta be bukit panjang LRT for me. not only does it make awesome West makan places such as Al Azhar's so much more accessible, the long panels inside the station itself are a piece of art to look at!$$It's such a hard choice to pick a fav !! I rlly like the unique Kallang wave designs on the floors of stadium !! Rlly brings me the feels of feeling cool and shiok when I take Mrt there for concerts and shoppings!! The view outside the stadium mrt is great too since there is a splendid view of the waters and landscape of Singapore üòòüòçüé°‚öìÔ∏èüåä$$I like Rochor MRT station. Simple, sleek and elegant and a an evergreen feeling just like G2000! Hope to win the vouchers and get myself some G2k clothings! Thank you!

My favourite would be the Stadium MRT. It's full of photos of sports images on the walls And I love the huge station, it looks like I'm inside a ship! The contrast lightings, the sleek grey design is very modern. I often go there to Sports Hub library, and I buy my sports apparel there.

I love G2000 because of the classy, clean and trendy design of the clothes. I love being chic and trendy.$$My favourite is the Stadium! The Jewel tone blue makes me feel at ease and happy! The sleek grey wall outside just nice for people who loves to take selfie or wefie! Cause the plain sleek grey design won snatched away ur presence instead it turns out to be a very nice background ‚ò∫
I love to go G2000 to shop for my bf office wear. It always have nice shirt and pants and it makes my by look smart in them! 
Liked and shared ‚ò∫$$My favourite mrt station has got to be Stadium! The cutting edge design esp the colourful 'runway' makes it look like you are overseas!

My favourite would be the Stadium MRT. It's full of energy with sporting images at the entrances/exit of the MRT! And I love the colours of the flooring! Furthermore, it's the MRT station I am at everyday! 

On the website, it states to say why you should pick me, and my answer is just simple because I need a wardrobe upgrade for work!$$I like the Dhoby Ghaut series with the pretty glass patterned window panels! It just makes every outfit look awesome with the natural lighting! 

Very nice series of OOTD! I need to shop at G2000!!

Meghan Tan Krathlyn Yu Yvonne Chong$$Liked and shared! Love the bras brasah station ceiling which allows natural light to get in! And of course the super long escalator (such that it can feel like an amusement roller coaster ride for the faint hearted! * grab the railings! Don't turn back! * )$$I love Redhill station the most, it is not a new station and its design is not as nice as the rest of the mrt stations but it brought back many childhood memories as I used to stay there with my dearest grandfather! He is not around anymore but whenever I pass by this station, it will remind me of the fond memories I had with him!

Thanks thesmartlocal and G2000 for this  giveaway!$$Bras basah mrt has got to be the favorite for me with its unique and mesmerizing architectural design. Plus the super high see through ceiling that gives the natural lighting and zen colour codes of the mrt walls makes it ideal for having ootd in G2000 winter wear!$$Liked and shared! 
I love the stadium shot, as the grey walls gives the calm feel, and the blue waves in the station gives the futuristic feel. 
I would often hang around kallang wave, and this is also the reason why i love stadium mrt!!:)$$My favorite among all the photogenic mrt stations will be üöá Dhoby Ghaut Station!

Born a west-sider, I've always like to make extra effort to doll myself up going the distance away especially town areas. Apart from that, the station is underground and air-conditioned, which would allow me to dress in any type of outfit and no sweat! üí¶ G2000 have wide range of really nice and comfortable formal outfits best suited for working class (like ME!) and I love taking varieties of OOTDs anywhere that I can find in public. Now IT's Time For MRT... Doors closing, dududududu.....$$Liked and shared! My favourite mrt station would be Rochor because simplicity is key! White and black colour scheme never grow old and it looks so unique and stand out most among all the mrt station in Singapore! Furthermore its on downtown line which is my favourite line and I am quite sure alot Westies rely heavily after its launch last year!$$Love all the pics esp for Dhoby Ghaut station! Liked n shared! 

My answer for why should you pick me... I need more work clothes! & I love the clothes @ G2000! Hope to win! ‚ò∫Ô∏è$$i liked Redhill mrt based photos. its red in color. its got ""age"" in the photo. Bring back fond memories with the payphone booth. At the wall base, you can see some aging and some wear and tear. I reflects that we need to look after our past to look into the future!$$Liked the 2 FB. Liked and shared the post. I didn't know that there are ""primary colour stations "" along the East-West line. I will go explore the west -- just make pit stops at these stations to take pictures with one MRT ticket - station after station!  Different colour, even simple plain colour could just set the different mood and feel - so this is my Favourite of the lots, esp the cheerful yellow at Commonwealth station.  
üíõ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüíö$$6. Commonwealth.

I grew up there, its a station that holds so many memories! From going to malls, schools and even town, its so accessible and convenient! The colours still remain which brings out the many years of untouched history unlike new stations that are too colourful. üçÄ$$My favourite is Stadium MRT Station. The station interiors are lit up by natural light from a large opening in the roof. Aluminium cladding adds luminosity for a ‚Äúsoft-touch‚Äù look. Stadium MRT Station really stands out among other train stations with its good design and innovation.

http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20151208-smile-youre-in-asias-friendliest-metropolisDinner in Manila or cocktails in Makati. Why you should do business here.","I've just visited Manila last 3 weeks, and I almost agree with this article.  By showing their politeness everywhere, especially when you go across the street and get the invitation from driver, the Philippino's behaviours actually inspired us so much when I came back to my country. I definitely will come back Philippin for another trip. And I suggest that you should come here at least one time in your life and get your own evaluation. Every judgement on paper is only for references.$$Ella May Agustin it says, The first thing you‚Äôll notice about Manila are the stares you attract from locals. No one grows up in this city being told that it‚Äôs impolite to stare, so the habit has just stuck. Don‚Äôt worry, these are just curious glances and the only response is a friendly smile.$$It is said friendliest NOT safest...which is means the true nature of legitimate productive individual of a certain area (manila /manile√±os). There are bad elements everywhere and there are certain areas (locals and internationals) that are not that friendly. 
Not all legitimate manile√±os lives in manila anymore ...so one may encounter the wrong people.
It is said ""walang tao na nagkakalat sa sariling bakod"".
Manila had been flocked by local and international tourist. Legitimate manile√±os welcome them with open arms and later abused their hospitality and enviroment. Some manile√±os were forced in anyways to live outside their domain.$$Lets be honest, Manila is not tourist friendly with all those snatcher, pick pocket and other scammers roaming around the street of Manila looking for the next victim.$$Yes friendly people but also the most rude people of any country I have been. And Manila? What a joke.$$Ah well I still think it's a lovely place and yes I have had the taxi driver experience except my Filipino partner saved me. Like any city you always need to be careful. Never been pick pocketed in Manila or anywhere in the Asia but have been in London England!üò°$$To my mind taxi drivers are to foreigners the unofficial ambassadors of any capital city.
The way the majority of Manila taxi drivers have behaved over the Christmas period is nothing short of a disgrace.
You have a long way to go before you can truly be regarded as the friendliest to foreign visitors.$$Even my Philipino friends avoid Manila when possible and I don't think Manila is a good advert for the rest of the country, which is beautiful. My experiences of Manila are unfortunately all bad. Out of there as quickly as possible and head to other places asap :)$$Thank you for sharing this. As a Filipino, I would definitely prefer to spread news around the world that we are a nation with goodness. We offer the best hospitality service in the world and we have a lot more to offer. With a growing tourism industry, we need to help with the promotion by simply asking our fellow colleagues to come and experience it for themselves simply by sharing news such as this. I KNOW we have issues that are yet to be dealt or currently being and I DO ACKNOWLEDGE that...but c'mon mga Pinoy and Pinay: is it so hard to share something good about our country?

Merry Christmas and an advance Happy New Year to all!$$Those who had bad experiences, (patawad) sorry. My personal appologies. You went to the wrong places. Philippines is generally a peaceful, friendly country. Im speaking in behalf of the multitude of Filipinos who strive to be good. We own it up. But we are up for the change. We are almost there. Thank you for coming and please arrange your next visit. Change is at hand.#duterte2016$$But the overcrowded place is  Manila hhahaha...$$Oh Manila is not Philippines.  Get over it. Have you been to other cities outside manila.. people can be so negative
. New York can be filthy and dirty to me if your brain is working all right.$$PROUD TO BE FILIPINO! ASHAMED OF OUR GOVERNMENT SYSTEM!$$I don't generalize there are good and bad people every where not only  in Manila. Philppines is a beautiful country that's for sure but province life is the best$$hahahahaha   especially the taxi drivers ,,,,,$$what? friendliest? paki double check. I am not against it. I am actually happy but it was not friendly when I was still in the Philippines. (Terrible traffic, pollution (air, garbage, etc).$$Social engineering has done a marvelous job, based on the comments this post has garnered. This way of thinking degrades the thinker. Manila is unable to rise above such diatribes because its population has been steadily fed what is bad about it and not encouraged to overcome imperfection and strengthen what is good. Careful, a nation divided against itself easily falls.$$One of the most dangerous city in the world. One of the most  corrupt  country in the world .

We learned after we got back to Daegu that they rent cabins at the recreational forest, I checked the site and its all in Korean. I want to reserve a place for the long weekend in Sept. Do you have any info on who to contact (in English) to make this happen?!!??

PS. Geoje is great.. I wish they put more info about it into the travel books.. we got excellent pics!!$$Geoje-do is a beautiful island with some exquisite views and interesting things to see.  Although lacking in hotel accommodations (though the Samsung Hotel is decent) and restaurants for those who may not be used to Korean restaurants, this island remains one of Korea's hidden treasures.  Here is short video of one of my trips there:   http://www.youtube.com/frobro747#p/u/20/P5JvY0rX_a8 $$How difficult is it to find a hotel that allows small dogs?  $$Thanks for the great feeback about Geoje Island! @ Melanie I would recommend calling (02) 1330 to find out specifics about the campground you are interested in. @Joseph, your video was very cool! Thanks for sharing :) @Jennifer, The idea of having dogs inside one's house is a little strange in Korean society.  Think about how you should take off your shoes before you go in the house in Korea, well dogs don't have shoes to take off, so it can seem a bit unsanitary to Korean people.  There may be hotels that accept it, but you would have to ask when you make a reservation. ""it's better to beg forgiveness than ask permission"" could also be a good mantra to follow, but there's no telling how it will turn out.    If your dog is loud, or causes damage, it could be a very costly affair for you.  There are such things as dog hotels in Korea (this one is in Korean, but just take a brief look: http://hotel.dogtel.co.kr/) it could also be a good choice.

If you're travelling between cities, you can send luggages a day before. For example, from Osaka to Kyoto. If you want to send to the airport, it's best to do it two days before. Most major hotels will accept your luggages on your behalf. In fact, the hostels I've stayed in had no problems with the luggages. It's best to inform the place where you will be staying beforehand so that they will have a staff ready to receive your luggages.$$This is one of the best services I've found while traveling.

‚ÄúDARUMA‚Äù is one of the well-known lucky charms of Japan.
The doll is modeled after Bodhidharma who is the founder of Zen sect of Buddhism, and it is traced back to more than 200 years.
When DARUMA is sold, both eyes are not painting. When you purchased it, you draw an iris on left eye. And when your wish came true, you paint an iris on right eye.

Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture, is most famous for production of DARUMA doll.
In the city, there is DARUMA-JI temple, where you can see lots of DARUMA dedicated to the temple after making people‚Äôs wishes come true. 

From Tokyo to Takasaki station, 1h 30min by Shinkansen, bullet train. Then, it takes 20 min by bus to the temple.

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University‚Äôs Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don‚Äôt welcome science. They didn‚Äôt provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport‚Äôs History.
That‚Äôs Why I Couldn‚Äôt to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

I came here after meeting my fiancee in Korea. She was a missionary and I was an English teacher. I really wanted to explore‚Ä¶","Haha, living here in Makati, I agree with most of it. Cold showers were at first a rude awakening, my wife's house, no hot water or A/C (we married last year, I stayed instead of us moving to my country, she is self employed). The Provinces are beautiful. Still not used to the pail and bucket, T.P. is in the house :P. I am thanked when providing exact change.  People are friendly, but one must keep in mind in an area like Metro Manila, it also has elements all large Metro areas have, a criminal element and some pick out foreigners, reality, must be self aware. And will get stared at by a few lol. Security is everywhere, the malls, businesses. I like it. I give Philippines 5 stars.$$As peace corps volunteers in Leyte, we always filled the bucket up hours before our  'showers'  so that the water had a chance to warm up.  But sometimes it was so hot and humid that the cold water coming straight from the pipe sticking out of the wall felt great!$$it's really nice to read nice comments from foreign friends who have visited and is currently staying in our country, Philippines is totally far from other superpower countries where almost everything is advanced in technology, clean and so on... Philippines is still one of the 3rd world countries, poverty is still every where, living in the province is definitely something to try, though you really have to leave most of the luxury and convenience technology can give in place of fresh air, beautiful scenery, simple living, great people, and everything is cheap compared to city life in the metro!$$Another thing is some people do charge you more for some stuffs thinking that you are a foreigner but then change the rates when you speak Tagalog fluently. Other than that cool and friendly people.$$Philippines is a lovely country & nice place to live in ( much nicer if you have a bit of money - thats the reality about it )...I lived abroad for quite sometime now, but, I always think & longing to go home as much as possible in the Philippines ( as always they say...there's no place like home where most of your family, relatives & friends are)...I'm going home in a month time to the Phils. for just a Holiday/break...I can't wait.$$I don't care about the brown-outs, cold bucket showers, unreliable wi-fi....it's part of Filipino culture....bahala na. I am happiest sat on the ground in my fianc√©es house in Palawan  eating with my fingers - hopefully  lechon, adobo or bicol express with sinangag. Halo halo with fresh coconut, mango and pineapple for dessert. Then a few red horse or emperador and karaoke....lots of smiles and laughter. That's why the Philippines is my 2nd home...it's such a wonderful place to be. I can't wait to live there in a few years :)$$I hope  my husband  want to live in phillipines .

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/first-flatWe know buying a flat can be the most stressful thing you've ever done - even more so than doing your PSLE all those years ago. Here's some tips to help hack your way to home ownership!","Congratulations Kent Gan, Emma Gem, Ajeek Syasya, and Michelle Lim! You've all been picked as the winner for this giveaway. Please PM us with your Name, IC number, and Email Address, and we'll get back to you soon :)$$Homeowners should get to know the culture of the community they live in. For example, what are your neighbours like? Do they dislike pets? Get to know the people around you. That's important.
Another thing new homeowners must know is their own financial capabilities. I'm sure budgeting concerns were taken into consideration before buying a home, but with new budget constraints, homeowners must now know how to appropriately spend within their means.$$New homeowners need to play with their numbers in terms of financially by calculating, comparing and considering what is within their means while not over budgeting causing financial woes down the road.$$For new homeowners, it is important to protect your biggest investment, make smarter decisions, and avoid costly mistakes. We must consider the finances carefully.$$Liked and shared this post!
Answer: Check your keys. Make sure each key, even the one for your letter box, opens the corresponding doors properly.
Hope to win TheSmartLocal.com GoBear! ‚úåüíù$$Firstly, thank you TheSmartLocal.com for this generous giveaway! Well in my opinion, I think one of the important aspects is that the couple must have good understanding of their financial capabilities. For example, to go for contractor instead of designer, in order to save some cost. Also, to go for more practical items. Sometimes, simple is beauty (lesser cost is involved). 

My hubby Neo Wei Xian & I are waiting to receiving our HDB keys soon! It will be a great surprise if we can be awarded with the furniture swag package!! :D$$I think it is important to know the value of the neighbourhood that you are buying. By choosing a prime neighbourhood and location to set up your home is important. Some key factors include public transport options, accessibility to shops or medical clinics, and whether there are schools in the vicinity that will tie in with my family planning. I will also want to ascertain the value of the neighbourhood for future investment purposes.

Taal Lake, Batangas

What is it like? 
Since 1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. The most recent large eruption was on this day back in 1965.  Although considered active, this small volcano has been quiet over the last few decades. As a matter of fact, now there are hiking tours and overnight camping packages on offer.

Fun Fact: 
Want to know what it's like to swim inside a volcano? You can in Crater Lake. It's said that the high sulfuric content has medicinal properties. Some people have even scuba dived here. But don't stay too long. The lake's water also has high concentrations of boron, magnesium, aluminum and sodium in salt form.

I forgot the name if the restaurant .$$I've been here once. Beautiful place. Magnificent but what disappointed/angered me was that this place had so many horses! Some of them were malnourished and asked to carry heavt tourists up.. they were so skinny and some were so sickly. Please travel by foot if you ever go up this volcano. We travelled by foot and it was the most satisfying feeling in the world at its peak.$$Md Mehdi Hasanzz Please refrain from posting ads here to avoid being banned. Thank you.$$Yes! This is a great place to take your family for a weekend getaway. I can't wait to visit here again with my husband!$$A big misconception is that many people believe that Taal Volcano is part of Tagaytay City. It's not! It just happened that Tagaytay is one of the highest point in the area where you can have a perfect view of the volcano and lake.

Tagaytay City however is where one can view both of them. Because of the cool weather and relative cleanliness of this city, it has became the most popular tourist location. It offers comfortable place for busy Manila dwellers. 
Sadly however, development is taking its toll in Tagaytay. Condominiums rise up and threaten its natural scenic beauty. As a resident of Tagaytay, we hope the local government exercise better Urban Planning than other cities.

Let's all work together in looking after our beloved Philippines :)$$Puka Beach is still a nice beach but again there is constauction just as you enter the beach now .. Boracay has lost its shine for me$$One of the things to do in Boracay: stage a protest for its protection.$$Best thing one could do for Boracay, at the moment, is to stay away...$$stop promoting this island, instead start saving it!$$Boracay island in the province of Aklan. Got powdery sand, clear waters to the bottom of the sea. The water is less salty, what a paradise to experience .$$Boracay for me lost its charm after being over developed, with kick backs paid to the Mayor abd corrupt central government officals..  How dose the Mayor of Boracay and Aklan  have a SWISS BANK ACCOUNT on his wages >???????$$Please improve the transport system and its fascilities! Where do all the taxes go?

While Mudumalai‚Äôs western half receives the southwest monsoon, the eastern tracts receive the relatively gentler north-east monsoon which results in a diversity of vegetation and typical migration of herbivores.

Here are some things You Never Knew About Traffic/Parking Enforcement Officers (A.K.A Fatimah)

Because LTA enforcement officers are really just doing their job.

Follow Ladyironchef for more stories like this!

http://www.ladyironchef.com/2014/12/traffic-parking-enforcement-officers-fatimah/It is most definitely a Singaporean thing to call our car park attendants and traffic wardens ""Fatimah"". We are not too sure how it started too, but the term","why do LTA motorcycle officers behave like they're Traffic Police ? just what is their training? is it specialised training?? Exactly what are their powers ? does it included any power to arrest members of the public? are they allowed to engage in pursuit of suspected illegal vehicles? members of the public have been speculating all of the above questions and more, perhaps someone could give some insight as to just what their powers are?$$üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª as much as I empathize with the pay structure and all. It still doesn't give them a right to behave like they are the king of the roads. Yes, civilians should not try to challenge the existing traffic rules, but LTA wardens should be a little bit more forgiving?  
I have personally seen taxi/Lorry driver uncles running with their might to get out of the No waiting zones . And all I see is an unsympathetic warden pressing with their might on that summon machine like they are playing the final stage of game of thrones. So yah~ whatever it is. 3 million BOoooos üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª$$If I was the LTA officer and any member of the public comes so close to me in menacing way, I would have threw the punch too. Whatever the hell is it, you respect one's personal space. You want to scream and shout, you do it at reasonable distance. But if you come right up to my face, inches away, threatening me, all bets are off.$$Problem with Singaporean is they like to challenge public servant. Do public servant owes you a living ? They are just doing their job. If you don't flout any rules then you will not have to face them. The main thing is the public always like to give excuses such as "" only a few minutes or just once "". And if public servant gives them a foot then they expect a yard. Judge your own attitude first before you judge the public servant. Reflex on yourself, your use of words, your tone and most of all your many excuses.$$For certain area surveillance camera works very well . Minimise conflict between human , if Drivers want to pay $300 for their convenient , it is ok.. So next time use robot to issue summon ticket to those Drivers who do not know the rules .. If you want to fight robot go on .. Robot will not get agitated no matter what you tell it ..$$My personal opinion, these so call LTA enforcers r just piece of shit, when really there r illegal parking, they r no where to b found but when u happened to park at carpark or loading/unloading bay exceeding the timing, u will c a fine ticket at ur windscreen$$This so called LTA are mostly foreign bastard ! Want to come singapore and show their power ! LTA should stop employing them$$Why should we need to know . Bottom line, is beating up a civilian part of your job too?$$I saw the video on the LTA officer punching a uber driver and is being suspended of all duties. However the video also clearly show LTA officer being provoked by the uber driver whispering into his ears b4 lta officer swing his punches. Although there is no excuse to the fight however condemnation at this stage ia uncalled for.$$Sure bo? 12 hrs work 6 days a week for $900 only per month govt job? Thats 72 hrs a week.$$As much as we need to empathize their job..they shld also show more empathy especially to those delivery drivers, cab drivers etc. i am very sure these so called ""law-enforcers"" do not abide by the law themselves all the time as we can so often see them on social media parking by zig zag and double yellow lines, den went off to buy food or smoke..it's a two way respect if they want to be respected, they shld respect others and show more empathy in the first place .. Pls understand everyone is trying to earn a living and it's already a stressful thing to live in a FINE city.. More empathies will make this society a better place$$Most of the traffic/parking enforcement duties are now outsource to companies on contract basis like Certis Cisco, Aetos, Ramky, ST Technologies etc. If the contracts are not renewed, the traffic/parking enforcement officer will most likely start all over again from the base salary with another company and as a result will most often not see an increase in their salary.$$Why thankless job. .think we will be thankful without them leh.... haha$$If u cant endurance those vuglar , then dont join those service line or related government job.$$Walking pieces of shit.$$I wanna join LTA too beating and fighting FOR FUN AND THE BEST punishment IS ONLY
GOT SACK 
Haha worth it$$Every job has its own stresses and ups and downs. Doesn't justify beating someone up just because you don't like your job.$$This idiot lta (cisco) guy shout first before this thing happened. Read first before comment ! He's fucking idiot ! Think he wear LTA uniform very big is it$$If beating up is part of the job, let me knowü§ì$$Nonetheless I still despise them.$$Agree they are just doing their job but some of their attitude SUCKS...$$I won't be surprised a bill has already been passed to allow LTA officers to punch civilians.

Walk thru Hort Park where there are plenty of spaces to run around as well plenty of old school swings and plant covered little shelters to sit and generally have a cosy chat, hike up the little hill to the museum and hike down the other side.$$Thank you for sharing.

As part of the celebrations under the #VisitPhilippinesAGAIN2016 campaign, the Philippine Department of Tourism in the United Kingdom launched ""The Station Domination Series"" in one of London's busiest train stations, the Waterloo Rail Station.

Starting last 24 April 2016, the first ""Station Domination Series"" features a special immersion zone that gives commuters a feel of the Philippines' beauty and promise of an overall fun experience when they travel to the Philippines. The launch also coincided with one of UK's most anticipated events, the London Marathon 2016.

The ""Station Domination Series"" also gives commuters a chance to win instant prizes and a holiday to the Philippines in three fun ways. One is by taking ‚Äúfoot selfies‚Äù using our floor stickers mapped around the station concourse, second is by taking part in the 3D selfie stand, and third is by experiencing the Philippine islands through a 360 virtual reality pods with photos by photographer Rommel C. Bundalian. 

Apart from the experiential zone, the campaign also features a month-long Philippine branding presence on Europe's largest LED screen found also at the Waterloo Station.

This activation campaign will run until 23 May 2016! Got friends and relatives in the UK? Tag them now! ","This is a fantastic idea!

Yabusame is a traditional art of horseback archery which used to be for centuries an important part of Samurai discipline. The event is starting from 1:00p.m., but here is a secret tip that you can enjoy Yabusame!
Try getting up early to visit morning practice in the shrine. You can take your time among so few spectators and closely watch archers harmonizing themselves with horses, their skill with their spirit in the crisp morning air. They will take you back a millennium to the age of the Samurai.

What is it like? 
Starfish, also known as sea stars, are one of the most popular creatures on the sea bed. Although Palawan has a place called Starfish Island in Honda Bay, this particular orange starfish was found biding its time on Snake Island.

Fun Fact: 
The mouth of a starfish is found in its center. Though it's hard to imagine, these creatures have intestines and a stomach. But they also have an ability to digest food outside their bodies, and so can feed on prey much larger than their mouths.

The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what‚Äôs around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to development in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is

Cocoa Beach Island Resort is a sprawling 10-hectare paradise with crystal clear waters lined by coconut trees and wooden bungalows. The resort has four restaurants, a tennis court, two swimming spools and a spa.

Fun Fact:
A ""service family"" who live close to your cottage will take care of you during your stay at the  resort. They offer baby-sitting services for three hours, and even a full-time nanny to take care of the kids.

It is located halfway through Panglao along its coast facing the Bohol Sea. It is a sprawling property which covers 16 hectares. The topography of the resort is diverse. It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

http://www.idreamedofthis.com/2013/11/27/what-i-really-think-of-the-philippines/Heartfelt (and hilarious) observations after living in the Philippines for a year.","I'm not confused. I love it here, retired in Cebu for a year & half now, did take me a while to just slow down after 35 years in San Francisco Bay Area, have been all over Cebu Bohol Negros Oriental and the best Palawan. Yes poverty is pervasive but the Filopino people are the friendliest most humble on the planet.$$Wonderful article and very honest about these remarkable people. I have been blessed to have married a beautiful Phillipino women ha and family. She is an incredible wife. I plan on retirement in the fils. Slow my life down and love and support my aswa with all my heart.$$I've been to Manila and Cebu. I loved them both and especially fell in love with the joy of the people who live here. üòç$$This is just garbage written by a woolly-brained American liberal wracked with misplaced white guilt. The Philippines is fine. Happiness isn't about material wealth at all--though wealth is great! 

And the wonderful thing is, the economy in the Philippines is about to boom. Many many people are going to experience so many good things very soon there. They have finally solved the only real problem they ever had: Corrupt thieves posing as politicians.$$I've also been there for a month living with the people living in the privince and witnessed some city boys and girls begging for money on every corner in the cites. Yes people in the province were different. I heard they emphasize happiness over financial richness several times. Meanwhile I got some chances to talk privately with the young girls (not the boys) then I noticed some different inner sides and desires. They mostly said that they wanted to live in a bigger house and hoped that they would be able to go abroad to live a richer life with modern environment. Briefly speaking they said they want to live in a more modern style than now. Of course they said they are happy with the current life with their family members and relatives but deep inside I found that they yearn for some different lives as in the TV dramas or in some films. Happiness is indeed something relative. If the girls hadn't seen any more developed coutries and lives first or secondhand they would be perfectly content with their recent lives. But the opposite is the case for those girls living in the 21th century. I come to an conclusion which is half subjective and half objective that people in PH have two inner sides in one of which they are really happy despite of lack of money and in another they hope for a better more modern life now.$$This is just purely an opinion from a foreigner who is just merely comparing Phil and his home country- just his personal unsolicited observation. In anyway doesn't represent the Filipino culture as a whole. Indeed Westerners have high standard of living but working at least 16 hrs a day with two or three different jobs just to be able to pay their taxes, bills and credit cards for a lifetime!!! I still choose the Filipino way.$$Was in the Philippines two times now. Loved it and plan to come back. Have friends there and i see how hard their life is! As in any country in the world there is light and darkness....till now i had no bad experiences and hope the next trip will be as wonderful as before. Im thankful to read about other peoples trips and how they see things. Looking forword to go back and see more places!$$Thank you for being true in your observation and expressing your feelings about our country and I'm glad you saw the good and bad side of it with an open mind and an open heart....I applaud you for your post and you are more than welcome to come and visit our beautiful country again and again...God Speed$$I've been to Philippines two times now. I love it! I'm married to Filipina and one day would love to retire there. Very good article!$$The Philippines is my most favourite destination. The beauty of Bohol and friendly people makes me excited to come back soon. I have also encouraged my friends not to look past it with so much to explore, but no balut for me !!!$$Nice, honest and candid of Mr Allen's stay in the Phil. 

Thank you for both the great and challenging stories you shares. Visit Phil again. 

Ps: this article was written three years ago.$$Nathan Allen is like Kyle Jennermann or more popularly known as ""Kulas"" who's a Canadian and loves it in the Philippines so much. Thank you guys for loving my country!$$I pretty much agree with you, on everything. Even though,  I've been going to the Philippines for the last 10 years, and my wife is from Luzon, I really enjoy the warmth of the Filipinos!

Teary eyed when done. Tsada magpuyo dri no? Salamat sa pag appreciate sa Pilipinas. God bless you more. Take care always.$$The parts about America are somewhat true. I never felt I needed to buy a Starbucks to fit in, maybe I am different but if you can't afford it then don't buy it. Many Americans agree with me and don't feel pressure like this author feels. If you don't want it don't buy it.$$This guy really doesn't understand piany, he judges from a perspective of America, and mo own experience's there seeing poverty, seeing  poor helping the poor, and people with job's help as well, hindi one can judge a country from a year!

Next time, maybe you can visit the Eastern side of the country, wherein they have different language and somewhat different cultures, not to mention good places to visit too. :) :) Cheers!$$Yea...i dont think hes confused.

How to Get There:
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

The tradition of the kalesa (horse-drawn carriage), was brought to the Philippines by Spaniards in the 18th century. They were originally reserved for nobles and the power elite, but are now commonly used on tours of the historic Intramuros district.

Fun Fact:
Very close to Intramuros and a must-see for all tourists is the Binondo Chinatown -- the oldest Chinatown in the world, established in 1594.

Hahahaha!!! :-D$$Hearing ppl mispronounce ""liaise"" ALL THE TIME is my pet peeve. It's ""lee-ayz"". I cringe every time i hear ppl say ""lai-yers"" or ""lay-yers"".$$You're exaggerating. Unless you know the culture and customs of countries all over the world, you can't claim that all these are uniquely Singaporean. For example, kiasu-ness is not, and people in Japan and Taiwan also avoid the priority seats in their trains. For them, it is the courteous thing to do because they do not fall into the categories for these priority seats. Who's to say our people are not doing so for the same reason? Also, how do you know people in other countries do not complain? As far as I know, they take their complaints even further, by picketing, striking, etc. Stop putting Singaporeans down with these derogatory comments.$$Yeah I understand of all of these and I do all of them$$Iam so sick of "" 6""...which is so irritating$$Complain everytime everywhere üòÇ Katelyn So$$Hahahaha about 10 are completely true Cindy Wiggle Macadongdong.

Every fifth full moon, religious ceremonies are held on this lake. During the rituals, small gold fish are released into the lake to honour the goddess Enjini, the queen and ruler of Mount Rinjani.

Pasay, Metro Manila

What is it like? 
On the first day of September, the Filipino Christmas season unofficially begins. Christmas trees and star-shaped lanterns start to fill the streets. Schools start to put together plays about the birth of Jesus Christ. Christmas remixes of the year's most popular songs start to play on the radio. The whole country is transformed for a solid four months. It's the longest Christmas celebration in the world. And it also has a good claim to being the happiest. 

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
Adults or children form groups and visit homes at night to sing carols. When given change, young carolers typically sing a thank-you song in Filipino that goes, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so kind, thank you!"" When given change money, the song changes to, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so stingy, thank you!""

Mr. Trump,

I try my hardest not to be political.  I‚Äôve refused to interview several of your fellow candidates.  I didn‚Äôt want to risk any personal goodwill by appearing to take sides in a contentious election.  I thought: ‚ÄòMaybe the timing is not right.‚Äô  But I realize now that there is no correct time to oppose violence and prejudice.  The time is always now.  Because along with millions of Americans, I‚Äôve come to realize that opposing you is no longer a political decision.  It is a moral one. 

I‚Äôve watched you retweet racist images.  I‚Äôve watched you retweet racist lies.  I‚Äôve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy.  I‚Äôve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to ‚Äòpay the legal fees‚Äô of those who commit violence on your behalf.  I‚Äôve watched you advocate the use of torture and the murder of terrorists‚Äô families.   I‚Äôve watched you gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.   I‚Äôve watched you compare refugees to ‚Äòsnakes,‚Äô and claim that ‚ÄòIslam hates us.‚Äô  

I am a journalist, Mr. Trump.  And over the last two years I have conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of Muslims, chosen at random, on the streets of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.  I‚Äôve also interviewed hundreds of Syrian and Iraqi refugees across seven different countries.  And I can confirm‚Äî the hateful one is you.  

Those of us who have been paying attention will not allow you to rebrand yourself.  You are not a ‚Äòunifier.‚Äô  You are not ‚Äòpresidential.‚Äô  You are not a ‚Äòvictim‚Äô of the very anger that you‚Äôve joyfully enflamed for months.  You are a man who has encouraged prejudice and violence in the pursuit of personal power.  And though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are.

What is it? 
The town of Anilao may not have white sand beaches, but its underwater environment is its biggest attraction. Dubbed as the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines, its deep waters teem with marine life and an abundance of corals and reefs. For non-divers ‚Äì the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

How to get there: 
Take a bus to Batangas from Cubao or Pasay.

Fun Fact: 
Diving conditions in Anilao are ideal for divers of all experience levels. The water temperature is consistently warm, and the surface is typically calm and smooth throughout the year.

Kanchipuram, the golden city of a thousand temples, was once the capital of the Pallava dynasty. It is considered one of the seven sacred cities of India; some of the best temples were built here during the reign of the Pallavas between the 6th and 7th centuries. Subsequently, Kanchipuram also served as an important city of the far-flung empires of the Chola and the Vijayanagara dynasties.

Later, these dynasties too contributed greatly in the temple building activity of this town. 
The city has also been, through the years, a great seat of learning and culture. Adi Sankaracharya established his episcopal seat (Kamakodipeedam) here. Sri Sankaracharya, Appar, Siruthonder and the great Buddhist Bikshu, Bodhidharma, once lived and worked here. Today, it is known not only for temples but also for its hand-woven, silk fabrics.

Singapore$$I would like to see Darren Anderton in action as it's been 21 years since he set foot on Singapore soil. 26th May 1995 was the day he missed a penalty and the only time Singapore team won against a premier league team. That was the day he became my favorite England player as he was so gracious in defeat and I'm going to get him to sign on the very ticket if I win! I still keep it for 21 years as I know he will be back one day. Hope being a hardcore and loyal supporter of NUEVO VINO wines will help me fulfil my dream of meeting my favorite England player! I have certainly prepared myself for this Masters! üòç$$Firstly , I'm spoilt for choices which player I would love to meet as ALL of them are stars indeed in their respective experience and teams back then.

The German legends simply outcast the England team in general. They have several World Cup experience in depth in almost all individuals. Though I may said that Lothar Matthaus is one of the finest World Cup winning captain, I would prefer to meet TEDDY SHERINGHAM in person instead.

For one simple reason when Man United claimed the treble trophy in 1999.  I am among ONE OF THE MILLIONS Manchester United fans around the world n Singapore who loves watching his goal against Bayern Munich back then.

Big Teddy is my hero...forever!
I am all set to meet him and have prepared a jersey for him to sign and have a photo with him. I hope my December birthday wish comes early this time round.

Thank you, NUEVO VINO and TheSmartLocal.com for this contest opportunity!$$After Paul Scholes announced his retirement in 2013, football lost an icon. Now, I have the chance to watch the best English player plays. It will definitely be an eye opening experience!$$Throw away club rivalry and bring on national pride. Every legend players counts. 1st time SG is honoured to have the battle of Europe. Who can forget the 5-1 England beat Germany with goals from Heskey, Gerrard and Owen and of course Didi Hamman for scoring the last goal in England old Wembley. Revenge is surely on the card with countries at stake. Didi is surely the one that I love to catch him in action again as he once scored a stunner against Man Utd last year. We are blessed to have great sponsors for such a great sporting event in this part of the world Asia. Way to go !!! 

Thank you and wish me luck.$$Wow! I look at all the comments the competition among the hardcord fans is strong, especially all the collectibles they have!! I wonder would I still have a chance to win this, nevertheless still gonna try.

I would like to see Paul Scholes!! I remember during my secondary school days watching all the matches he played and playing it on fifa. and Paul scores! Those were my younger days. This is a match not to be missed by all the legends. Match of a lifetime!$$Paul Scholes!!! Not only he played for my beloved Man Utd football club ...He is a true midfield maestro not only he can tackle, and his passing and shooting is of the highest level. to meet him will be a dream come true for me!$$Without a doubt, I hope to meet Teddy Sheringham as who can ever EVER forget his exploits in Man United champions league final against Bayern Munich!!! Even though I am a gooners fan, I just have to applaud Teddy as considering his age, he shouldn't even be playing with that much intensity!!! Heck, for me at that age, even climbing the stairs up 7 storeys will make me panting for breath every step!!! At 50 years old this year, Teddy deserves the accolades for a successful career and I definitely can see him scoring at least 1 goal in the match!!!!

So KUDOS to the main man Teddy and I hope to shake this legend's hands and oh ya, I need to get this gold plated card of Teddy signed!!! So give me a chance to fulfill my dream!!! Thanks, TheSmartLocal.com and NUEVO VINO!!!$$Can't wait to catch DIETMAR HAMANN in action, cos he is one of the best Defensive Midfielders of his time and well more importantly hope to meet him cos I missed getting his autograph the last time out :)$$Hope to get a chance to finally watch the Ginger Prince Paul Scholes play in real life and not on tv as I have twice failed to catch his matches during my time in England. Always a step ahead of everyone else as per Luis Figo's quote ""I am star-struck when I see Paul Scholes because you never see him. On the pitch you can't catch him. Off the pitch he disappears.""$$Definitely Paul Scholes for me !! Seeing him in action on TV and in real life will be totally different experiences !! I am surely looking forward to the game !!$$I would like to see Paul Scholes live in action because my favorite epl club is Manchester United and Paul Scholes is a of one the legend star player in the club.$$It would have to be Paul Scholes; I first met him in 2014 before Ryan Giggs' first game as interim manager against Norwich City. I jokingly queried if he was going to make a second comeback, having previously been coaxed out of retirement by Sir Alex Ferguson. To the disappoint of the fans, he said ""no chance mate""! 

On top of being such an affable character and a man of few words, he used his performances on the pitch to do the talking. The long and varied passes that were pinged with such accuracy, something that Manchester United is currently lacking. He was the one who made me understand that football was more than just about scoring goals; he made playing football seem so effortless.

He is the sheer epitome of all-round talent, and I do hope that I would get to meet and see him grace the pitch again.$$give me a CHANCE to CHEERS with Emile Heskey again maybe this TIME we shall TOAST with wine anyway he BREAKS through DEFENCES like NOTHING$$Paul Scholes. Cos he once challenged C.Ronaldo to hit a tree 50m away in 1 shot and he won hands down! That guy can pick a pass when no one else can!$$I wanna see stuart pearce, gareth southgate n chris waddle take penalties against germany again... ;p$$Definitely Daniel Ben Murphy!

In year 2001, Paul Scholes visited Singapore with his teammate. I was studying my O Level during that time. I told my mum I want to travel to Singapore to watch the team played especially Paul Scholes who is my idol since I was a kid. My mum said she will pay all my expenses if I can score straight As in my O' Level. This motivated me so much and I managed to visit Singapore and watched the team played. 
Without him, I may not have so much motivation to excel in my O' Level. So now I got the opportunity to thank him in person. I wish NUEVO VINO & TheSmartLocal.com can give me the opportunity to meet my idol. Thanks.$$Paul Scholes and Teddy Sheringham vs Jurgen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff$$I want to see Steve McManaman in action at our National Stadium on Nov 12! He is from my favourite Team LiverPool. Steve McManaman is the first Englishman to win the Champions League with a non-English club and also the first English player to win it twice! Remarkably Remarkable!

Technology is the force behind it. Now this is what you call making life easier and flexible.$$Due to the amazing advances in technology over the last 10 years, a lot of us now have access to variety in almost every aspect of our lives. If we need a ride, there is no need to stand by a roadside waiting for a cab or to call a cab. Now we whip out our phones and within a few presses a cab comes to us, through apps like Grab, Uber, and even Ryde. We dont have to go to travel agencies and ask which hotel is the best. We just go on Expedia or AirBnB to find accomodation that suits us best. All these examples really reflect how flexible our lives have become because of technology.$$Internet banking has made my life easier by being able to pay my bills before the clock strikes 12mn, so that I won't be liable for late fees!

When ATM machine and AXS first came out it was a great help in reducing waiting time and make life easier and more efficient and as times goes by, technology improve and we now have mobile AXS apps on our phone. This is DIY 2.0, it is an evolution from the standalone DIY machine and has make life even easier for us as we can use it anytime, anywhere.
I am waiting for the day my mobile banking apps can let me withdraw and deposit cash, i believe that day will come$$As an 18 year old man / boy / guy / student, technology has vastly improved my life. 
First of all, lets talk food. Applications like foodpanda, deliveroo, mcdelivery , ect has made ordering of food through calls a thing from the past . We can order food so easily now,  by just tapping, swiping, ordering and paying . "" Hardworking"" and ""busy"" students like me don't have to waste time , going to a hawker centre or fastfood restaurants to queue and wait for food now . There are even apps like Honestbee and RedMart  , that delivers groceries to our homes. 
Secondly , we have applications like zalora , cotton on , sephora , that allows us to order fashion items back to our homes without travelling. We can even buy gifts for our friends through apps like these . Its fast , easy and definitely it has made our lives more flexible . 
There are so many things i can say about technology , though it has it's downs , the ups greatly overthrows them . It's 1:36 am and I have school tomorrow , so imma go now . HAHA i hope i can win those vouchers , cuz i really wanna eat sushi :< And i would love to intern at THESMARTLOCAL.COM ( Sings the theme song ) But i would save that talking for another day :)$$Technology has made life much more flexible in so many different aspects; messaging applications have bridged the gaps between us and have allowed us to connect to one another and share more of our personal lives with each other on the go, real time, even when we're physically apart. Mobile applications have also made it possible for us to pick up languages and other skills during those bus rides & MRT rides, turning self-improvement in our packed school/work lives from a fairy tale to reality. :) With all this advancement of technology, we are now more inspired to further technology, and imagine a better, more flexible future for ourselves. :)$$Liked and shared

I am a InDIYpendent Singaporean in overseas too. I remembered during my last customer visit in Shanghai. When I boarded the plane bound for Shanghai, I saw many business travellers boarding the planes with cakes and gifts for their clients or maybe their loved ones. As a InDIYpendent, I simply place my cake orders from a portal and they delivered to my hotel. So simple. No sweat.$$The advanced in technology has made travelling a less-hassle, enjoy our favourite food as and when we want and also time-saving when it comes to shopping and grocery buying. This was not even possible 5 years ago and we can see how fast technology has progress to enable us to lead a fuss-free life. What i envision in 2030 to be more convenient and faster than the current technology just like those in superheroes movie XD$$1. Like and share THIS post
2. Technology has made life more flexible. We can now order food online and have it delivered to our homes. Video Chat with family from oversea. It is like they are just next to us. And we no longer need to go to the library or book store to get the books we love. Just dowload the ebook for your reading pleasure anywhere and any time.$$The convenience technology has provided us can be felt not just by customers, but also by those working in the f&b line. Taking of orders used to be by paper and pen, which is not just troublesome and time consuming, and order papers could be easily lost or destroyed. But now with technology, we can easily key in the orders into the cashier and immediately both service and kitchen would have machines churning out the orders without mistake through wireless internet. And now customers can get their food and be happy B| 
(liked and shared~)$$technology has made life more flexible in three ways. 
one, when i am stuck in a deserted toilet with no toilet paper i no longer have to use my socks or wait 300 years for someone to come, i can just call someone with my handphone to come down with supplies.
two, when i am the loner at the party i no longer have to stare around awkwardly, i can whip out my phone and pretend i have a life and so many people are messaging me oh gosh.
three, when i see all the cool new phones and lappies i gotta catch em all so technology has given me new and innovative ways to become a poor and bankrupt student.$$Long long time ago when I was in my late teens and early twenties, I have many friends who broke up because one partner is going overseas to study. A few more years down the road came msn then Skype and now FaceTime. If they are born in this era, they wouldn't need to break up la. They have the flexibility to video call on PC/ Laptop or FaceTime/message/call using various phone apps. Technology have saved many ‚ù§Ô∏èrelationships‚ù§Ô∏è.$$Liked & shared!

Technology make my life more flexible and convenient when I am hungry and need for food I can simply call for delivery without even stepping out of my house! I can contact my friends with Watapp on mobile phone and stay in touch with friends through Facebook and messenger! No more letter writing which take time to reach my friends save on paper and effortlessly to stay in touch! Tagging Jennifer Ong Boon Chye$$I love how technology allows and helps me in communicating with people on the other side of the world. I would look forward to every night as i would be able to video call my mom as she moved to Thailand. We would talk about everything and anything HAHAHA it almost felt like we were side by side and things were the same like when i was a little kid. I am kind of an awkward potato andddddd im an introvert. I used to bury my head in books and not socialize with people of my age but playing online games has helped me out tremendously as it made me feel comfortable talking to strangers and connect with people from other parts of the world. From chatting behind a computer screen and slowly to video chatting with my best friend from maplestory. She has helped me to become a more social person and made me feel comfortable in my skin because I was made fun of alot in school and was an outcast. But, she was there for me and I would always look forward to going home and pouring my emotions out to her. She was a good listener. She taught me to create a blog and let me share about my life experiences. I'm so glad technology was invented and really glad that i have met my first true friend :)$$Technology has made life so much more flexible in so many ways. Communication is one of the aspects that have become much more convenient. Previously, once the date and time have been fixed, it is hard to change it at the very last minute. With smartphones, we can now create group chats and update everyone on the date and time to meet with a simple message. Also, it has allowed many cross-border exchanges, be it travelling or business deals, and strangers, friends and even families are able to connect despite being in different countries.

Look forward to more exciting developments in the next generation of technological advancements. Hope I can still keep up with it in my 60s, 70s... :) Our lives will be more intertwined with technology!$$Technology has made my life easier and more convenient. From online banking to online shopping to ordering your taxi from your smart device. All it takes is a push of a button and sometimes you may not even have to own a credit card to enjoy having everything sent to your doorstep. Yes, some shops accepts COD! :-) But what I love most about these modern conveniences is that I get to spend more time with my kids and husband. The time supposed to be spent in walking to Sheng Siong and hauling 30 kilos of grocery with 2 howling kids in tow is now better spent playing catch in the park or watching movies at home with my feet propped up. Other than that, I am on extended maternity leave because I can work from home and submit my reports online. How cool is that? Perhaps I will order that chicken rice from that flying boat after all. Kristina OngDee Kaytee Polyndevilla Vic Peng$$Technology has definitely made life more flexible by allowing me to order fast food like MacDonald's, Pizza Hut, KFC etc with the click of my hand. It totally helps when I stranded at home with 2 little ones. 

Liked n shared!$$As Singaporeans, we love our food as much as we love our choices. With the advancements in technology, not only has our food become more delicious, dining has become more fun as well.

For instance, many would agree that having sushi off the conveyor belt not only allows us to dine at our own pace, the myriad of choices is also part of the fun. 

Having Korean BBQ wouldn't be as fun if the meat came to your table properly grilled as opposed to cooking it to your desired doneness, thanks to technology that makes it possible for diners to grill the meat and eat it right after.

And what about designing your own fluffy pancakes from bottles of pre-coloured pancake batter? 

All these dining experiences would not have been possible if technology did not exist - no longer do we need to prepare food beforehand before sitting down to a meal with friends or family - with technology, even the cooking can be an activity that bonds people.

We cannot deny that the future of food is closely linked with the advancement in technology. After all, one day we may be able to have our meals in a self-driving vehicle while taking in the beautiful scenery - life does not get more flexible than that. ;)$$Technology made our lives easier by allowing us to read almost everything and anywhere via our smartphones, so now I can just read stories and articles (esp thesmartlocal articlea :P) on the go!",3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn‚Äôt a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 ‚Äî known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It‚Äôs only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They‚Äôve got water and waves to spare.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Surigao (one hour), then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a bus from Manila or Davao to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

An Appeal to the United Nations from a former Filipino Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly

I am Michael Francis Acebedo Lopez, a Filipino and a former delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. Nearly ten years before the questionable rise of one Leni Robredo to the Philippine Vice Presidency, I had the honor of representing my country, the Philippines, as the youngest Filipino delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in its history. I also had the opportunity to be the Philippines‚Äôs first actual Youth Representative or Delegate, a partial fulfillment of our commitment to the UN‚Äôs World Programme of Action for Youth or WPAY. 

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accepted my letter of credential signed by the Philippine Foreign Minister. There it was stated that I was attending the General Assembly ‚Äúas Adviser to the Third Committee Plenary Session on Social Development, including questions relating to the World Social Situation and to Youth, Ageing, Disabled Persons and the Family.‚Äù In the august halls of the UN World Headquarters in New York, I also had the honor to draft and deliver the Philippine Statement to the General Assembly‚Äôs Third Committee. 

In light of Vice President Robredo‚Äôs video message to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs posted on TIME Magazine‚Äôs website and shared by various media organizations, I am recalling the mandate I was once given in an effort to reach out to all of you, member states of the UN and all organizations within the UN System. If said mandate is not sufficient because it has long since lapsed, I am hinging my appeal therefore on my being a natural born citizen of one of only four Asian nations who signed the 1945 Charter that created the United Nations. 

I am making this urgent appeal on behalf of each and every Filipino grossly misrepresented by our a Vice President in said video message, a Vice President whose own mandate has been called into question, with the highest electoral tribunal of the land, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, having considered the election protest against her win to be sufficient in both form and substance. 

With unfounded claims and unsubstantiated allegations, Vice President Robredo wantonly painted an impossibly grim image of the Philippine situation if only to attract international attention and action. To say that she delved in speculation is understating the gravity of her made-up claims and the severity of the damage she has caused on our country and our people in so doing. In reporting to the world what she failed to report to Philippine authorities, assuming there are actual reports received by the Office of the Vice President, she has not only embarrassed our country, she has betrayed the public trust and committed economic sabotage, both punishable under Philippine laws. 

For her to say that ‚Äúour people feel both hopeless and helpless‚Äù is a brazen lie. Confidence in the presidency is at an all time high (while the same cannot be said of the vice president whose approval ratings continue to plummet); as a people, we feel hopeful and empowered like we‚Äôve never felt before. 

Please understand that at the heart of this is destructive party politics. It is the Vice President‚Äôs party flexing its muscles to overthrow a duly elected government so they may once more regain control of government. Perhaps she feels time is running out for her because of developments in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal. So she and her allies have launched an expensive campaign using human rights and the War on Drugs as their excuse to bait the world into interfering in our domestic issues. 

When the Vice President says 7,000 people have been killed in the President‚Äôs War on Drugs, she fails to mention that this is set against the backdrop of around 700,000 to one million successful arrests and surrenders. So the figure she presents to you is not even one percent. And surely with the sheer number of those involved in the illicit drug trade, some police operations see suspects resisting arrest and fighting back and the police having to defend themselves resulting in casualties. Every war has casualties. It is not a perfect war and I‚Äôm certain there have been abuses along the way, and these need to be looked into and those responsible must be brought to justice. But exaggerating things does not help at all. 

In asking for the international community, the UN, to intervene, she uses the issue of human rights. Let us then talk about human rights. 

In responding to the call of Robredo, the international community must tread carefully lest it encroaches on our very sovereignty and our right to self-determination. And as a sovereign state, we have determined to wage an internal war (not a war against another nation) against the evils of drugs, a direction affirmed by our democratic processes when President Duterte who included the War on Drugs as one of his main programs of action, received an overwhelming mandate during the May 2016 Presidential Election. In short, the War on Drugs, by extension, has the people‚Äôs mandate. 

Any effort to disturb our democracy and sovereignty as a response to the Vice President‚Äôs irresponsible and unfounded claims will subvert the will of the Filipino people and violate our Human Right of Suffrage enshrined in both the Philippine Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 21 of the international covenant). 

Once again, I am making this appeal to all member states of the United Nations and all organizations within the UN System to disregard the Philippine Vice President‚Äôs statement which is, I reiterate, a grave misrepresentation of the prevailing sentiments of our people and a gross perversion of the facts surrounding the War on Drugs. 

To my fellow Filipinos, let us remain vigilant in the face of threats to our democracy by the very people who claim to defend it. Ako po‚Äôy nanawagan na i-share ang video na ito upang ito ay umabot sa UN at sa iba‚Äôt ibang foreign governments. 

Maraming salamat. Thank you and good evening.

The pure beauty of the country and the smiles of the people make up for it.$$She obviously didn't try the kaldereta, sinigang, lumpia, lechon, paksiw and the abundance of other delicious foods in PH. Not to mention the Laos version of the Larb. Otherwise, an interesting ranking article.$$Thailand is my favorite country in southeast asia. And Thai food is the best.$$A tourist guy who been in 37 countries especially in SEA he ranked the Philippines #1 on his list.but it's really indeed sad that our government do not push to hard to improve our systems of infrastructures.$$Haha yes Thai food is the best slightly similar in some ways like the provinces way to cook using similar spices which is always overlooked by Manila people. But she always talk about temples? Who wants to se temple from one country to another unless if someone wants to be a monk.

About the zipline, this is a new venture so a lot of people don't know about it yet. You should definitely go with a backup map or contact information to show to taxi drivers when you go.

Me and my friend got lost in seoul. We are both Filipinos and it was the first day of our vacation, so expect us to forget our way out of the subway. Haha. Yes, because of excitement we forgot to remember the station and the exit near our guesthouse. We got the last trip to seoul station that night and we walk back and forth to the exits to remember our way out until our feet and legs got very tired. We decided to go out of one station and ask someone for directions but no one can understand english well and also they didnt know where is our address(we also asked someone in the reception of a school and he told us that we are far from our address) We are in doubt of his direction because as far as i remember i actually said to my friend that we are not near yongsan station but seoul station on our first ride on the subway so i am really in doubt of what he said. But because we are hopeless that night we bought tickets to yongsan station just to get home. But our doubt is so big that we decided to go out again of the seoul station and find our way home. While walking on the streets my friend suddenly called someones attention, we asked him if he know our address (we show him our guesthouse reservation) and he responded that we are on seoul and our address is in yongsan that is very far from our current location. He started to find our way through google maps and showed us the distance and it is actually really far. We insisted that our address is near seoul station but we cannot remember where in seoul. He search again and again on google maps and we can feel that he dont believe us until he asked us if we trust him. I said of course we trust him (because he looks trust worthy and we are hopeless that time). So he asked us to follow him (yes, he really guide us to our guesthouse). Near our guesthouse i can feel the happiness (of course because we found our way home and we can now rest). We didnt know how to thank him. I asked him if there is something that we can do to thank him and he just said ""no, its pepero day tomorrow. Do you know pepero day?"" and i said ""yes"" and he lend us his box of krispy kreme and said ""this is for you, tomorrow is pepero day"" (i didnt remember everything that he said but it was like pepero day is a day of helping, sharing and love. At first i did not accept his krispy kreme because i am ashamed of him (he helped us find our way home and now giving us a box of donuts) because it is too much for us but he insisted so we end up accepting it. All we can say that time to him is thank you so much again and again. We are very thankful because he passed through us when we our hopeless. We dont need his donuts, his kindness is too much for us. His name is Tong Kwon. We are very thankful that we met him. :)$$Yes I love PAPERO....Next Autumn I m going to Korea...but my concern is #HALAL food.

Model: Symone Oei ","Just visited. Nice ambience, free wifi, TVs all over, kids corner was a nice touch. 

Ordered the dinner set, after some time asked them when's the food coming and they asked ""so what drink did you order?"" I know Jia Lat Liao. When the food came bak ku teh soup was not hot, satay was ok, ice holicks was diluted, hot holicks was ok, after about an hour I'm still waiting for my nasi briyani. Service speed is like 1/10. Maybe teething issues. But don't come hungry. You'll die of hunger before your food appears.

Update, briyani still mia. Kitchen didn't prepare. Cancelled my order, owner wanted to charge me 2 drinks and a scoop of ice cream. Half way keying in said he won't charge anything. Funny thing is walk past the kitchen the staff were all standing around doing nothing.$$the Indian in me is calling out blasphemy, but looks like a shiok leh$$disgustingly horrid place with effing' bad service with China waitresses who dont even know what they are serving. no crowd yet food took 20 mins to come with multiple wrong orders like almost 5times. had like 8 or maybe more waiters over there but no crowd yet all acting busy and no one bothers to give you the menu or to seat you either. 
took the wrong order and they didnt even bother to ask what was the correct order and just walked off leaving us with no order. really OMG. dont bother trying seriously. SERVICE SUCKS SHIT!$$Went there already, portion quite small and a bit ex.  Prata texture not as good as expected, still have dough not cooked enough.  Chilli crab sauce normal, salted egg prata normal.  Mushroom chicken prata dom not bad but price and taste compared to a mushroom chicken pie elsewhere, it lose out.  Ice cream and waffle was ok.  Overall speed for food poor.$$Is the model or blogger even genuine about her comments for the food served? Food is not served hot. Gave wrong order even when we ordered from tablet. Food is just average but pricey. Only good thing we had here was the french fries with cheese, 10 bucks for it though. 

Sad to say but really upset with my experience. Never gonna visit here again I guess.$$I went there today after seeing this post. 

NOT IMPRESSED. 

The soup with the garlic stick was good, but the soup was luke warm. 
The chilli wrap was not too bad, but serving was a tad small. 
We also had the mushroom chicken prata bomb, which, to be honest, you might hafta put a gun to my head before I pay for it again. 
We waited 15mins for it, and the fillings were Luke warm, and it tasted horrid. 
The lemon tea was nice, albeit a tad too sweet 

We left the place filling hungry after paying 35 dollars 

At least now I know not to trust everything I see on FB. :)$$Blogger is paid to write a positive review even how fcked up the food and service. Nothing beats the classic original Indian prata with spicy curry fish!$$It's an awesome place with great food and pleasant ambience.

Very happy and grateful. üëç$$Went there for lunch, no comments about service. It was okay. But the food was terrible, sad to say. Might have been the indian in me, but the curry was like water(?) the chilli crab was more like ketchup and the pratas were just meh
Theres better prata for less than half the price outside$$Went on a week day lunch so no crowds at all.. Food was so so ..

It called ‚ÄúKANNAZUKI Á•ûÁÑ°Êúà‚Äù, literally meaning is ""the month when there are no gods"".
According to the ancient mythology, it is said that 8 million gods (Shintoism) of Japan gathered together annually at Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine (in Shimane prefecture) on the 10th month of the year. So only in this region the 10th month was called ‚ÄúKAMIARIZUKI Á•ûÂú®Êúà‚Äù, the month with gods.
 
Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine is well known for a god of matchmaking and many people who wish to find a spouse are visiting this shrine throughout the year.

 #MyVisitKoreaStory$$#MyVisitKoreaStory from July 2016 is a different kind of travel story because it is not about nature, the grand palaces or the unique food in Korea. This photo is inside the venue of a concert I attended in the Olympic Stadium. It was a very memorable experience to be joining the fan chants while EXO performs. During this trip I also got to know fans from U.S., Australia, Japan and France and knowing that Korean pop music has inspired them enough too to make a trip to Seoul. This trip made me see the intense K-pop culture of the youth while still being friendly towards foreign fans. This was a very different trip for me because I used to make trips to immerse myself into Korea's nature, busy shopping streets, art cafes and grand palaces. This was a trip that made me closer to my fandom and also fulfilled my wish of watching my favorite K-pop group right there in their home country. Truly, a beautiful memory I will always keep with me.$$My first trip to Korea with my daughter's! It was a dream come true. I was born in Korea and went back when I was little. I wanted to go back with my mother but she passed away in 2008. I always told my daughter's that we would go to Korea and it finally happened this year.  It would be awesome to go back and see the rest of the country of my mother. #MyVisitKoreaStory  May 2016$$#MyVisitKoreaStory Having to immerse in their local culture I decided to try out their street food stalls which is really fun. Seeing the friendly lady cooking for me and the grilled aromatic of the fresh seafood and meat just simply makes my stomach growling really loud which lucky the Locals beside me are too busy chatting away.$$Photo was taken when autumn season in November 2015 that was my last day for trip of korea. Feel like at home. I am fall in love with korea at the first sight when i saw a drama Autumn in My Heart. This country is so beautiful and makes me always wanna go there. I will waiting for my lovely Knight and go back there to lock our love forever.

#MyVisitKoreaStory$$I am from Indonesia, a tropic country where it has only two seasons: dry season and wet season. Therefore, I have a dream willing to experience other seasons like spring, winter and autumn in different country. Then I choose South Korea for my autumn experience. Here, I went there on last October 2015. I visited Soeraksan and Nami Island. Those places were fullfiled with yellow ginkgo and red maple trees where the leaves falling everywhere. It was definitely beautiful. I never see maple and ginkgo before because they doesn't grow in Indonesia, and finally I touched them. Love it! #MyVisitKoreaStory$$I want to participate this event. I has uploaded my photo not sure that I'm do it the correct way or not cos I didn't see my post at Korea Tourism Organization webpage, kindly let me know I'm successful posted.$$Samcheongdong Hanok definitely caught my attention the moment I stepped on there. That place is simply picturesque and while in pictures it may not look interesting but trust me, the moment you reach there you really want to take as many pictures as possible and keep all the memories forever with you because that place just looks so beautiful and stunning. #MyVisitKoreaStory$$I was in Gyeongbokgung Palace back in this May and it's one of the most important and beautiful site to visit while in Seoul. The view inside the palace just looks stunning and it's pretty big place too walk around too. The construction and roof tiles is definitely unique and artistic for the ancient palaces. There is also a museum and there are just so many things to see and of course many pictures to take too :D. I'm looking forward to visit Gyeongbokgung again in another season during winter when the view is completely different from Summer. #MyVisitKoreaStory$$#MyVisitKoreaStory This meal at Jinokhwa Halmae Wonjo Dakhanmari is situated at an alley at Dongdaemun (ÎèôÎåÄÎ¨∏) never failed to erase off my memory for the best delicious chicken pot that can be so exciting with the variety of condiments, kimchi, rice cakes and noodles that surprisingly from a plain chicken hotpot that can magically turn into the best Chicken Hot pot that I ever tasted in my whole life. It was the most memorable dish for me and certainly I been craving and wanting to go back there to indulge again.  #KoreaTourismOrganizationVisitKorea$$#MyVisitKoreaStory from October 2015

Autumn is my favorite season and it is unfortunate that we don't experience it in the Philippines. That's why on my first solo trip during autumn in Seoul, I took the time to visit Seoraksan located in the nearby province of Seokcho. I reached this beautiful mountain via the Dongbu bus line. Upon reaching the foot of the mountain where the trails begin, the orange and yellow leaves of the trees of Seorak are already visible. There are a lot of hiking trails and you can choose from which way to begin by the signages. I went to Biryong falls, Myeonsangil path, path to Biseondae rocks and Sinheungsa temple. Although I was not equipped enough to go to Ulsanbawi where the famous rigged stony trail is found on the way to the summit. It was a very manageable day hike for my first time hiking the trails alone. The tension bridge in the picture leads to a falls located deeper into the hiking trail. I plan to be back in spring and explore the nearby places around Seokcho.",0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/the-best-countries-in-southeast-asia-to-visit-rankedSomehow we only mention ""The Beach"" once!","Ph in the middle is abit low i think.. Except for the food complaint, i am not sure where he got his trouble with atm`s and bus seats... usually works fine for me, foreign credit cards and foreign bodytype :)   Thailand on top? only 1st  they have the right to is the food.. for the rest.. meh..  top notch thai resorts are also the best in SE Asia, but who can slosh out 800 dollar a night for that?  And they really suffer under the one thing they are really proud of.. that they never were a colony.. good for them, of course, but it also means introvertion, no curiosity towards other cultures, No foreign language skills outside main cities&tourist places.  All this is no problem for the thais,, but when considered as a tourist destination.. not so good.. One month in each place is also way too little.. i have racked up 5 months in the Ph.. and my bucket list just getting longer and longer :) As opposed to Thailand, where i was more or less bummed out by most of the things there after less than 3 months in total..$$I don't know why they love Thai foods!! My goodness I tried some of their foods especially the noodle in Bangkok and I would say it really tastes bad. The Philippines' just really not clear for some foreigners because honestly we're very different compared to our asian neighbors. They are composed of temples and other REALLY ASIAN icons and we have that big difference of having western culture and tradition which makes us not so familiar in the word ASIAN as even foreigners thinking if we're really asian or pacific islanders. But not too bad having western culture as it  doesn't makes us different from asia < I guess we're just having a big difference compare for them. #Philippines$$Not really bec she ranked PH midlist, which is not bad, bec of nonfunctional atms and small seated busses. If she had ranked the places base on the amount and quality of attractions, PH should be at least no 2 or 1.  JS$$Ranking is subjective. I just have to react to the suggestion to ""improve the cuisine"". Our food is part of who we are. Take it or leave it. And yes, we love adobo.$$I think issue with pinoy food is that we have lots of variety and havent figure out yet what we have to showcase to tourist, we have been serving them fiesta foods over and over like lechon,lechon kawali, kare kare, etc.. this are unhealthy and health conscious wouldnt rave about this
Why not develop our food identity by focusing on whats uniquely pinoy, like for soup, tinola, for vegetable laing, for chicken, inasal, for pork,pochero or adobo or even dinuguan, for fish kilawin tanigue,tinolang isda and the list goes on.

How can anybody pick Cambodia as #1 is beyond me! Cambodia is still struggling with having enough electricity and proper paved roads and high poverty! and the health care is usually no good. at least in Philippines the health care is good and affordable, among other things. definitely Indonesia has everything and more than any other Southeast Asian country, security is professional, food is amazing, health care good & affordable, infrastructure good, and prices cheap, plus many more things! plus the many foreigners & tourists to not make you feel like some kind of orphan.therefore Indonesia #1! :) (y)$$Hmmm I think our government should take this constructively.

Ladies and gentlemen!
I present to you a few suggestions to eliminate the negative impact of warming and a significant increase in tourist business. You miscalculated them, and if the proposal will be acceptable to dock and start working.
First.
If the work will begin immediately in January 2016, by the beginning of tourist season, I'd have to produce fresh water:
First. This innovation will make it possible in the spring of 2016 tourists drink crystal clear water pristine purity.
Second.
Use this water for watering can summer 2016 travelers will feed organic products straight from the beds, and it will provide an increase of tourists to 10-15% per year. Plus, the constant increase - parents with children with physical or mental defects. In subsequent years, innovation will be piloted by the tourists, and increase the flow of tourists will grow.
In the Philippines, it is also restored all the rivers, and land, and underground reservoirs on a level and clean. This will increase productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, the growth of agricultural and meat dairy products), and tracts of forest.
Third.
The large influx of tourists will force the government of the Philippines to increase the construction business for themselves and for sale. This will lead to an increase in employment in the construction business and dozens of related companies
Finally, and most importantly, what needs to be done immediately.
Philippines - a country many mountain formations. Mountain formation and neighboring lithospheric tectonic plates and many thousands were in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. That is what happened in the Indonesian nightmare when the tsunami killed 250,000 people. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And such or similar joints in the Philippines and around - many dozens. Programs of all types of cooling plates and joints are.
For 10 years, the ecology of the Philippines will be restored to the level of 1980. There basting to reduce damage from hurricanes over the current theme, but it is not yet finalized.
