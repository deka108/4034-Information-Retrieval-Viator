These days, some shops are only closed for the morning of Chusok day, when there is an ancesteral ceremony.  Some close longer, but you can still find things open.  $$That is a pity - we are trying to explore Korea and Jeonju is one of the places we shall go before going to Seoul, just not sure how to get to Seoul from Jeonju - do you know if there is a direct bus?

So are you ready?  You have 24 hours starting NOW!!! ","My favorite place in Korea has to be Seoul. The real story of Seoul is not hidden in the tall skyscrapers or the ancient temples that encircle the urban center, but in a few important landmarks that are both historically significant and symbolic at the same time. Take Jongno street for instance. Better known as the ""Bell Street,"" Jogno is famous for Bosingak, which is a marquee with a large bell. It is said the bell signals different times of a day and controls the four main gates to the city. The bell is usually rung thirty-three times at the midnight on New Year's Eve. However, when former president Kim Dae-jung took office in 1998, the bell was rung in the midst of an intense economic crisis that had hit the country. Every Korean worth his salt knows that Kim opened a new chapter of economic transparency and played an even greater role of steering the country on the world map by hosting international events such as the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The melancholic yet inspiring sound of the bell has definitely struck a chord with millions of locals and expats living in or across Seoul, just like me :)$$My favourite place is Incheon Airport.  It's a bitter-sweet feeling for me everytime I was there, the excitement when arriving and the sad feeling when departing...all beyond words.  The airport is always sparkling clean and alive, always welcoming to visitors and have good food and shopping to spend time before heading to the gate.  Best place to catch sun sets and to spot Rain. : )$$My favourite place in Korea is in Seoraksan National Park. At the peak of Daechongbong you can escape the hustle bustle of the city and get the ultimate view of the true beauty Korea has to offer. It‚Äôs a grueling climb to the top, but once there the scenery is breathtaking. You can see for miles on a clear day and bask in the peace at the top of the mountain. For me, Korea is largely about the mountains, and there is no better place to experience this.$$While we're on a food theme, it has to be Jeollado.  While I'd heard the food was going to be good (and it was), I'd also been led to expect the people to be a bit cold or tough.  Instead, I had some of my most memorable experiences on the road as people shared parts of their lives with me that I never expected.  In between that, I travelled deserted beaches on the south coast, walked through tea fields, dozed on a pagoda with a praying mantis in perhaps the prettiest temple I'd seen and cruised around glass-like seas.  And, of course, I ate.  A lot, well, and unusually, all prepared to an amazingly high standard (in a country that already had impressed me with the quality and care in its food).

Oh, and I highly recommend the goat.$$Call me a sentimental old fool, but it will have to be the old world charm of Andong for me. Even Queen Elizabeth II spent her birthday in Andong with a little celebration at the Soju Museum. Andong is the center of culture and folk traditions, noted for its serene beauty. I love history and Andong is steeped in it, right from the Three Kingdoms Period of Silla, Goguryeo and Baekje right up to the Joseon Dynasty. At the core of Andong‚Äôs long and illustrious past were numerous distinguished scholars, aristocrats and noblemen. It has the reputation of being the best preserved ancient metropolitan city. You can still find many of the homes of the noble class in Andong today. It used to be the centre for Confucianism at one point in Korean history. I may not be a follower of Confucianism but I respect some of their beliefs like justice and good manners are the key factors in life and I also admire their filial piety towards their elders.
Though the die-hard Confucians are not around anymore, Andong is one of the few places in the world where Confucian practices are still directly being passed down to its descendants to this day, as well as being a centre of education. Its current inhabitants are the direct descendants of those who actually occupied the houses in the Joseon Dynasty era. Because of its highly historical value, the village itself is often being referred to as a ‚Äòroofless museum‚Äô.
I would like to go to Andong to enjoy a stay in the traditional hanok guest houses available throughout the area. The Hahoe Village, Jirye Art Village, Jeonju Ryussi-musiljongtaek (Ryu noble family‚Äôs estate), I understand, are great places to experience a unique lodging experience and to sample the true essence of Korea‚Äôs traditional lifestyles. I just love traditional old houses and seowons and Andong is a treasure trove filled with them. The Andong Hahoe Folk Village which was designated Important Folk Material #122 is now up for nomination to become a World Heritage Site in 2010. Hahoe is especially known for its mask dances. The Dosan Confucian Academy, the Byeongsan Seowon Academy, 
Jirye Art Village, Andong Folk Museum, Goseong Lee head family Estate, Imcheonggak Pavillion, Ocheon Relics Site(village), the Hahoe Mask Museum and a 600-year-old zelkova tree in the Samshin-dang area are what I want to see in Andong. 

Perhaps my exposure to Korean movies/dramas set in the Joseon era, like Untold Scandal, Daejanggeum, Hwang Jini, Damo and Painter of the Wind have  contributed to my obsession of Andong.

I must not forget to mention the authentic Andong food that I want to try like heotjesatbap (this dish originates from the custom of using vegetables, meat, and seafood dishes left from memorial services) that includes Andong-style bibimbap.
Andong specialty that is sometimes included in the heot jesa bap is gan godeung-eo, or super, super salty mackerel. Some other Andong dishes include Andong Jjimdak, Andong Sikhye and Geonjin Guksu.
$$I have 3 favorite places in Korea: the Gyeongbokgung Palace, including Changdeokgung Palace (Rear Garden included), Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksucgung Palace, and Joncgmyo Shrine. I'd like to stay at the ""Secret Garden"" that was intended for the King. I find peace and serenity while walking inside the palace grounds. The other place is the Korean Village. I want to live in the traditional 'Hanok"" house and experience korean living. Lastly, Myeongdong, particularly, the Myeongdong Cathedral (Catholic Church).  Solemnity and solace in this place, is a sanctuary for me.$$@George Romeiser Hogan: thank you for those beautiful words as you describe Korea in your heart. You are right in every detail. You are both lucky to find each other in such a wonderful place like Korea.

That sort of nonsense is unheard of here.$$should let S'porean feel to have no electricity for 2 consecutive days and water$$Some Singaporeans are just not thinking realistically, expecting everything in Sg to be perfect...including our standard of governance.  Would we be here talking about these things if they are so lousy?. They may not be perfect but to be fair, aren't that bad. Might I ask who else can do it better than them presently?
Many have travel and seen the world yet can't do a real comparison between us and other countries ....sad!$$Yes!
I told my mom when trapped inside mrt train last year... she thought i must be angry but i just told her better than when i was in Bangkok anyway, it was like hell over there. 3hrs trapped in mrt is better than living in terrible Bangkok!$$Probably im the only Singaporean that doesnt complain. Been to Malaysia and Indonesia, thank God im lucky to be born In Singapore ‚ù§$$44 deg heat with no air con in an old car in australia...Singaporean need to experience this once in their lifetime and they'll never complain about traffic again! Lol$$All is so true Singapore is just spot on$$Try driving in Jakarta's rush hour :)$$Why compare with Bangkok when you can compare with Japan ? If you want to compare with bkk, why not other things like affordable housing, cars, pace and cost of living ? If you want to feel good about yourself why stop at bkk? Compare your life with Palestinian ones la!$$True, but if you want to compare the areas which other countries are worse off than Singapore, you also need to compare all the areas which other countries are better off than Singapore. It works both ways.$$30 minutes traffic is not bad. I love the public transportation in Singapore. Nothing compared here in Manila. Imagine going to work on Monday morning and going back home on tuesday early morning due to traffic and flood.$$Singapore's geographic area is also 1/10 of these places. Why not more specific comparisons to cities of similar size and GDP? Maybe Hongkong or Seoul? Albeit our transportation remains the top of the curve in comparison to most major cities in the world, it doesn't make a fair comparison simply in terms of land mass.$$We are still using ADSL mind you....one big difference between Sg and oz was the ""speed"" of the internet here. I reckon my grandpa could ran quicker than loading a page in Oz! Lolll$$Well, the next time a Singaporean minister embarrasses the nation by comparing other countries unfavourably to us, let's not jump on him or her then yeah?$$Sawadee Jao. We welcome you to come to Bangkok to see our jam. Singaporean very lucky. Jam in aircon bus, even must stand is still comfort.

Master trainers of cormorants dressed in ancient costume freely manipulate 10-12 wild sea cormorants to skillfully catch small trout.

Raiding it almost cost a Network for Animals activist his life.
We located the building in the south of the Philippine mainland. An innocuous house at the end of a dirt road, hiding a grim secret: an illegal dog slaughtering operation, protected by well-paid security guards, who swung into action every time the killing commenced.

Our team secretly monitored the building. The heat, humidity, mosquito and ant bites took their toll. But it was nothing compared to what the poor dogs would experience:
Forced into rusting metal cages, their sensitive noses would know the aging scent of canine blood on the air. They must know their time is short, because those cages are hell-on-earth. Excruciating temperatures, horrific humidity, and nowhere to rest but on-or-under the bodies of your cell mates. No water. No food. No hope.
The illegal slaughterhouse owner earns more than $11,000 each month and protects his business with a pistol and fierce temper. Our team leader Mel and his companion Perry knew this when they were discovered hiding in bushes on July 14th. Mel ran until he almost fainted, but Perry was not so fast, or so lucky: He was captured.

Mel quickly returned to the slaughterhouse with the only available policeman. When it became clear that Perry had been abducted, four more officers arrived. Achingly slowly, the terrifying situation was diffused. 36 dogs were seized, and eventually our teammate was returned safely from the hostage situation. It could have been so much worse.$$WE LOVE AND PROTECT THE NATURE IN THE PHILIPPINES!

While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/words-singaporeans-mispronounce99.9% of Singaporeans mispronounce #9. Here are 12 words Singaporeans have been mispronouncing all their lives.","We are not native English speakers... so I don't really care... I hv Scottish friends who pronounce Monday as mourn day. We are still good in our English compared to many countries ....included our written standards to some white countries...The article is a good eye opener... room for improvements$$But in general, I hope that we would one day be able to tell others that WE ARE NOT WRONG. just like there is UK and AMERICAN pronunciation, we have our local version of pronunciation. As long as the whole country pronounce the same way. So please tell me how to pronounce LETTUCE.$$It's not the pronunciation;as someone above said; all languages affect the way people pronounce English. It's the whole acceptance of singlish  that I find disturbing!$$Imagine I ask for flar at the florist.... the aunty will say "" siao cha boa....no no no... ntuc see... go ntuc ah ok gal"" when in rome live like the romans$$Lol good summary! Almost every word sounds weird from the local pronunciation..$$flour & flower have the same pronounciation, which u can find in dictionary. if u argue of having different dialect or way of pronounciation in different country, its not entirely wrong.$$http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tlsQrgBdDM$$1) Opinion seems to be divided on the pronunciation of ‚Äúflour‚Äù in the British dictionaries I consulted. The Oxford Concise Dictionary (1995) and the Oxford Advanced Learner‚Äôs Dictionary (2005) indicate that ‚Äúflour‚Äù has the same pronunciation as ‚Äúflower‚Äù, i.e.: 

 /‚Äôflau-e(r)/ ‚Äì a two-syllabled word with the stress on the first syllable ‚Äì the ‚Äúe‚Äù is a schwa, like the ‚Äòe‚Äô sound in ‚Äúmoment‚Äù).  

However, the 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary (1989) and the online Cambridge Advanced Learner‚Äôs Dictionary show ‚Äúflour‚Äù being pronounced as:  

 /flaue(r)/ ‚Äì a one-syllabled word with three vowels together (a triphthong), the ‚Äòe‚Äô in it being also a schwa. Because of the combination of the three vowels in a syllable, we tend to glide over them, resulting in a sound resembling /fla(r)/.   

 I consider both pronunciations to be correct alternative pronunciations. In fact, there is also an alternative pronunciation of ‚Äúflower‚Äù, indicated by the 20-volume OED, which is exactly like the second pronunciation of ‚Äúflour‚Äù!$$Can blame Bon Jovi for mispronouncing ""prayer"".

What makes Bolangir a compelling travel destination is its scenic beauty, numerous shrines and the native tribal life.

Traditional hand-woven textiles life will allure the ethnic tourists. 

- See more at: http://www.incredibleindia.org/travel/destination/bolangir ","We made an online booking of two rooms for two nights in KSTDC Hotel Mayura Pine Top at Nandi Hills on 26.06.2015 and 27.06.2015. We stay at Kolkata. My son works in Bangalore. We went to Bangalore for two weeks. So, we hoped that we would enjoy a quite stay for two nights in this place, as it was very close to Bangalore, only 60 kms away. 
Nandi Hills is about 4500 ft high. Hotel Pine Top is situated in a beautiful place on the hill top in an isolated place. We reached the hotel at about 17 hrs in the dusk of 26.06.2015, by climbing a serpentine hilly road and became exited to enjoy the coming nights. 
When we arrived at the reception desk of Hotel Pine Top, we found that there were some hotel personnel seated near the entrance and some guests were enjoying evening tea and snacks in adjacent dining room. On the way, we also noticed a lot of parked cars, as it was Friday, the beginning of a weekend. 
We informed the hotel personnel that we had room bookings. They advised us to wait, but none came forward. After a while, one person moved to us. We told him that we had prior booking and showed him the reservation voucher. He called another person, who took our luggage, guided us to downstairs and opened two rooms. Rooms were two stories below the reception and one would have to climb down by the stairs by the side of the building. It was drizzling and the sky was extremely cloudy.
The rooms were glass-fitted with open front view of the valley. The view was really superb. There were steps to go down to a garden. From there, vast valley was being seen. The place was really calm and quite. There was a half-circle view-point in the complex, in the same level of reception, from where the view was more wide open.
But we could not stay. When we reached the reception, we found that everyone was disliking our presence. No one greeted us, as if we were non-invitees. No one was coming forward to speak with us. The person, who moved to us informed that there was no room available. No welcome message. Later we found that there was no other boarder beside us. When we informed that we had prior reservation, he told with a stoned face that there was shortage of water and electricity, as it was a hilly area. Might be. Then came the next point. We would have to take dinner within 7 PM, as there would no electricity after 7 PM. Water would be not available after 7 PM, 
We, however, accepted the proposal as we had nothing to do and nowhere to go. But, when the rooms were opened for us, no electricity was present in the rooms. Then we found no water in the tap in the bathrooms with lots of cockroaches in the rooms and bathrooms. Rooms were not clean and linens were not fresh and at some places dirty. It was becoming dark and we were horrified to find that big rats were moving freely inside the rooms and bathrooms. Street dogs were freely circling in the corridor and garden. We also came to know that mobile network would not work there. We were puzzled to think what to do in that evening. However, we decided not to stay in that horrible place. There was also no telephone connection between the rooms and the reception upstairs. So, at night, if there would be any emergency, we would find our way through rodents and dogs to go to reception upstairs, might be no one would be available there. After a good thought, we did not take any risk to stay there. Luckily, Bangalore was not far away.
We came back to the reception with our luggage and asked for the complaint book. When we told the hotel personnel that we would not stay, none asked us the reason, as if it was a better decision. We also noticed that in the complaint register, there were similar complaints by the previous boarders/customers, but KSTDC took no step. We wrote our grievances in the complaint register, but till date, no official from KSTDC/Karnataka Government telephoned us or made any query. We understood that though we noticed a lot of cars, all those people would return back to Bangalore in the evening and none would stay there at night. But we came from Kolkata,a far away place, to enjoy and were cheated. Probably, KSTDC/Karnataka Government does not have time to bother in such petty matter.
On our way back to Bangalore, we found other nearby hotels/resorts/lodges with electricity arrangements. We toured to other hilly remote places, even in high altitude, where supply of power were arranged at least upto 9/10 pm. Nandi Hills is a very good place for 1-2 nights stay, as it is very near to Bangalore. We could not understand why Karnataka Government was not developing the place. The hotel is beautifully placed, rooms are not bad, a big restaurant is attached, approachable road is there and lots of tourists come to this place. Only some developments, like electricity, water and mobile tower, are to be made. Then many other hoteliers will be interested to come to this place and the place will turn into a hot tourist spot. It is a good business opportunity for the local Government and also an avenue for development of local people. Instead of improving the place, KSTDC is charging higher for the weekends. The tariff of a double-bedded room was Rs.1150 in normal weekdays, whereas in the weekend it would jump to Rs.1500, which we had to pay in full. We felt very sorry that we could not enjoy this beautiful place. State Government is turning a deaf ear to the complaints made by the past boarders/customers, as the hotel personnel should inform the authorities that we left the hotel without staying. It was a case of cheating in the part of Karnataka Government. It is known to common people like us that the hotels/lodges run by Government/state bodies are safer and better places than the private ones.
We hope that Karnataka Government/KSTDC should be ashamed for charging boarders/customers without giving any normal basic amenities and should make booking after developing the hotel and area.

thanks for this great opportunity they give us their great contests we always have used for us are incredible !!!! thx
There are many reasons really why I wanted to travel to Korea for its great history, culture, food, sightseeing, for his music, everything is really impressive.
I would love to go first visit to Changdeokgung Palace, which belonged to the Joseon dynasty and be impressed by the great harmony between traditional bellaza and nature, it is also one of the few palaces that still preserves the architectural style of the Joseon Dynasty and one of the most beautiful among Eastern palaces ~~ !!! because it is also a UNESCO protected heritage and incidentally also go to Jongmyo Shrine and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty which shows the greatness of the Joseon Dynasty and see all the majesty of its historic charm !!
Then would visit Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon which is a more advanced representation of his time, also visit Gyeongju which is the capital of a dynasty that ruled the Korean peninsula for many years, then go to the Historical Complex Gyengju to contemplate large relics which is very impressive that still have an excellent state of preservation, then go to the Grotto and Bulguksa Seokguram Buddhist temple which dazzles me for its architecture, art and beauty of his nature also feel very relaxed by the great harmony and energy to be surrounded by great nature !!! and then go to the Yangdong Folk Village, Gyeongju and Hanoe Folk Village in Andong and appreciate traditional Korean houses !!! which dazzle me by the way he is love !!!!
Then I'd like to visit to Jeju-do Island go to Manjanggul which is regarded as the route network tunnels formed by lava world more beautiful !! It is also one of the best islands in the world ~~ see autumn visit this beautiful and impressive volcanic island is really very beautiful, see the blue sky becomes so beautiful and the woods surrounding mountains mentras the wind rushing around to another, see the beautiful flowers and cultuvos is really beautiful is a unique experience !!!!!!
Going to Korea and visit historical sites is a unique and unforgettable experience !!! incredible would be if I could walk on my stay at Seoul which is considered one of the most impressive and technological capitals !!! I also want to go to Myeong-dong and Dongdaemun which is the center of fashion in Korea !!!!! enjoy the delicious Korean food which is considered a very healthy and nutritious health food !!!! eat much pork kimchi, bulgogi with soy sauce and bibimbak which I love !!! would buy handicrafts and souvenirs from Korea to have it always pass ~~ I would buy cds of k-pop, because I really like the k-pop groups like Big Bang, Super Junior, JYJ, sistar, MBLAQ ..... I love you very much !!!! are the most fabulous ~~ !! also take the cable car, and there obserbar city with breathtaking scenery !!!!

The word swastika comes from the Sanskrit svasti, which means good fortune, luck, and well-being. In Buddhism, the swastika represents the turning of the ‚ÄúDharma wheel‚Äù, and thereby promotes goodwill, compassion, and generosity to all sentient beings. Regrettably, Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party borrowed the swastika in the early 1900s, reversed it, and used it as their party emblem during World War II. Not only do the Nazi swastika and the ancient swastika used in Buddhism and Eastern cultures differ in meaning, the Nazi swastika is also slanted, resting on a point, and has right angles bent in a clockwise direction.

But guests should not be pressured or obligated to give more money just because it is hosted at a five-star hotel.

Here‚Äôs why.

http://mustsharenews.com/wedding-angpow-rate/Here is why you should not feel pressured into giving a big red packet when you are attending a wedding dinner at a high-class place!","Red packets are a gift by the guest to the wedding couple. Don't turn it into a profit making business. It's your choice to choose an expensive location, it is my liberty to give a 'gift' that I can afford and reflecting my economic ability at the moment. It's a wedding invitation, not a Ticketed dinner event.$$Because Singaporean are being considerate as friends, neighbors and relatives. And because Singaporean fear losing ""Face Water"", some takes advantage of the situation. 

However, I have a friend (very wealthy himself) told his son (who was about to be married), do not expect the invited guests to keep up with amount in angpows since the wedding was held at top class hotel. And that should be rightfully so. Friends, neighbors and relatives should only present a wedding gifts they meant to be and affordable.$$Every couple wants the best,parents want to please relatives and friends to save face for themselves as well as for the newly web couple.
Remember the package include a lot of other expenses in which the Hotel/Restataunts/Event companies put in.
Actually based on the food alone it should not worth that much.
$800-$1000 is consider high.
So your red package should not be more than $280 per couple or $120 per person.
It is the real market rate.$$Well said.  It is a vicious cycle.  Give whatever you feel comfortable in giving as it is only a blessing and not fair for you to foot the couple's wedding dinner bill. 

Anyway, nowadays, eating less is more healthy. I suggest consider a 4 course dinner instead of a 8 course dinner will halve the cost of hosting the event or consider a buffet,  $10 per pax can help stretch $5,000 to feed 500 guests or 50 tables.$$If you do not have a big head, please do not attempt to wear a big hat which doesn't fit. (Chinese proverb)

Traditional wedding dinners are such a bore! Yawns!$$Someone I got to know invited me to his daughter's wedding - as a group of friends we all attended and each gave red packet - one check the hotel and call to find out how much the table will cost and divide by ten of us -  $100 each - later I heard his Son in law gave him a couple of tables and he made the money himself from the angpows he collect - what a shrewd oldman he was.$$Want to have face hosting wedding dinner at 5* venue then expect the guests to cover the cost?

She would be traveling to Japan next month and the climate there is said to be really cold. She has never seen snow in her 62 years of living and she intends to wear her track shoes there as she's a thrifty woman. Therefore I sincerely hope to win this voucher so that I can buy her a pair of winter boots to keep her feet warm when she travels to Japan next month. That's the least I could do as a daughter I suppose and not let her wear track shoes while walking in the snow (: happy 2016 to you guys anyway! Cheers*!$$I should win this because Chiang Mai is a lovely place and I'm singing its praises because I have been to this city, had memorable memories and would love to return again. With its breezy mountain weather, cheap food and many cultural places of interest. It's amazing and way better than Bangkok if you are more into the Arts and Cultural sort of person. I did participate in the festivals like Loi Krathong (floating the boat on water) and Lanna (floating lanterns), it's awe- inspiring. And I wish to return to experience the wonder sight of the Sakura blooming and check off my bucket list too!$$I would like to win this for a very special someone Samantha Lee. She is my fiancee.

Geox is a trustable brand for its comfyness which is stylish, at the same time, to match with all types of outfits!

Even Timberland boots only lasted maximum of 3 hours of walking for me when I travel. I hope to find a pair of boots that can lengthen the amount of time I can walk during my travels üòÄ.$$travelling for work and pleasure is hard to balance but this pair of geox would really make trips much less tiring! can't wait to see how far they can take me to see the world :)$$I owned a pair of GEOX shoes when  I was working in the hospital wards. Translate the 8 hours walking about daily for One Year. It outlasted two other pairs of shoes that I had. Amazing!!. I shall be looking for another pair this year to take me on a trekking vacation.. ahhh GEOX...$$Liked and shared. I should win as I am a big fan of GEOX especially because of its  technological innovation and Italian style. Geox's footwear exemplifies this style and innovation, thanks to original designs and exceptional breathability. In Geox shoes and boots, a patented system consisting of a microporous membrane placed on top of a perforated rubber sole allows heat and humidity to escape from my feet, and keeps the shoes fresh and comfortable all day. :D Despite this enhanced breathability, many Geox shoes and boots remain waterproof and that's crucial living in Singapore where it can rain anytime anywhere! :)$$Liked & Shared! I wish to win this because a pair of waterproof boots is important to me as I love to explore places with wet terrain and not to mention that my feet would be able to breathe in them too!$$like and shared. would like to win a pair of winter boots for upcoming trip in New Zealand! heard that GEOX boots are light and comfortable!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Haha, anyway my take is their wings are good. Unique texture, taste and crunch. but as for their F&C, i'm wondering if they are using Cod fish, (used traditionally for its texture and quality) or sutchi fish(aka catfish)? There's a difference in terms of taste and value for money.

Cat fish usually not the best choice because of origin of breed and also alot of western food stall use them because its super cheap. Most catfish are frozen so its unlikely to be fresh.

https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/the-best-countries-in-southeast-asia-to-visit-rankedSomehow we only mention ""The Beach"" once!","Ph in the middle is abit low i think.. Except for the food complaint, i am not sure where he got his trouble with atm`s and bus seats... usually works fine for me, foreign credit cards and foreign bodytype :)   Thailand on top? only 1st  they have the right to is the food.. for the rest.. meh..  top notch thai resorts are also the best in SE Asia, but who can slosh out 800 dollar a night for that?  And they really suffer under the one thing they are really proud of.. that they never were a colony.. good for them, of course, but it also means introvertion, no curiosity towards other cultures, No foreign language skills outside main cities&tourist places.  All this is no problem for the thais,, but when considered as a tourist destination.. not so good.. One month in each place is also way too little.. i have racked up 5 months in the Ph.. and my bucket list just getting longer and longer :) As opposed to Thailand, where i was more or less bummed out by most of the things there after less than 3 months in total..$$I don't know why they love Thai foods!! My goodness I tried some of their foods especially the noodle in Bangkok and I would say it really tastes bad. The Philippines' just really not clear for some foreigners because honestly we're very different compared to our asian neighbors. They are composed of temples and other REALLY ASIAN icons and we have that big difference of having western culture and tradition which makes us not so familiar in the word ASIAN as even foreigners thinking if we're really asian or pacific islanders. But not too bad having western culture as it  doesn't makes us different from asia < I guess we're just having a big difference compare for them. #Philippines$$Not really bec she ranked PH midlist, which is not bad, bec of nonfunctional atms and small seated busses. If she had ranked the places base on the amount and quality of attractions, PH should be at least no 2 or 1.  JS$$Ranking is subjective. I just have to react to the suggestion to ""improve the cuisine"". Our food is part of who we are. Take it or leave it. And yes, we love adobo.$$I think issue with pinoy food is that we have lots of variety and havent figure out yet what we have to showcase to tourist, we have been serving them fiesta foods over and over like lechon,lechon kawali, kare kare, etc.. this are unhealthy and health conscious wouldnt rave about this
Why not develop our food identity by focusing on whats uniquely pinoy, like for soup, tinola, for vegetable laing, for chicken, inasal, for pork,pochero or adobo or even dinuguan, for fish kilawin tanigue,tinolang isda and the list goes on.

How can anybody pick Cambodia as #1 is beyond me! Cambodia is still struggling with having enough electricity and proper paved roads and high poverty! and the health care is usually no good. at least in Philippines the health care is good and affordable, among other things. definitely Indonesia has everything and more than any other Southeast Asian country, security is professional, food is amazing, health care good & affordable, infrastructure good, and prices cheap, plus many more things! plus the many foreigners & tourists to not make you feel like some kind of orphan.therefore Indonesia #1! :) (y)$$Hmmm I think our government should take this constructively.

Me and my friend got lost in seoul. We are both Filipinos and it was the first day of our vacation, so expect us to forget our way out of the subway. Haha. Yes, because of excitement we forgot to remember the station and the exit near our guesthouse. We got the last trip to seoul station that night and we walk back and forth to the exits to remember our way out until our feet and legs got very tired. We decided to go out of one station and ask someone for directions but no one can understand english well and also they didnt know where is our address(we also asked someone in the reception of a school and he told us that we are far from our address) We are in doubt of his direction because as far as i remember i actually said to my friend that we are not near yongsan station but seoul station on our first ride on the subway so i am really in doubt of what he said. But because we are hopeless that night we bought tickets to yongsan station just to get home. But our doubt is so big that we decided to go out again of the seoul station and find our way home. While walking on the streets my friend suddenly called someones attention, we asked him if he know our address (we show him our guesthouse reservation) and he responded that we are on seoul and our address is in yongsan that is very far from our current location. He started to find our way through google maps and showed us the distance and it is actually really far. We insisted that our address is near seoul station but we cannot remember where in seoul. He search again and again on google maps and we can feel that he dont believe us until he asked us if we trust him. I said of course we trust him (because he looks trust worthy and we are hopeless that time). So he asked us to follow him (yes, he really guide us to our guesthouse). Near our guesthouse i can feel the happiness (of course because we found our way home and we can now rest). We didnt know how to thank him. I asked him if there is something that we can do to thank him and he just said ""no, its pepero day tomorrow. Do you know pepero day?"" and i said ""yes"" and he lend us his box of krispy kreme and said ""this is for you, tomorrow is pepero day"" (i didnt remember everything that he said but it was like pepero day is a day of helping, sharing and love. At first i did not accept his krispy kreme because i am ashamed of him (he helped us find our way home and now giving us a box of donuts) because it is too much for us but he insisted so we end up accepting it. All we can say that time to him is thank you so much again and again. We are very thankful because he passed through us when we our hopeless. We dont need his donuts, his kindness is too much for us. His name is Tong Kwon. We are very thankful that we met him. :)$$Yes I love PAPERO....Next Autumn I m going to Korea...but my concern is #HALAL food.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

confirmed it that he has made her decision,and he never wanted to see me again.

So on one evening,as i was coming back from work,i met an old friend of mine who asked of my husband.So i explained every thing to

her,so he told me that the only way i can get my husband back,is to visit a spell caster,because it has really worked for her too.So i never

believed in spell,but i had no other choice,than to follow her advice. Then he gave me the email address of the spell caster whom

he visited spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com So the next morning,i sent a mail to the address he gave to me,and the spell caster

assured me that i will get my husband back the next day.What an amazing statement!! I never believed,so he spoke with me,and told me

It wasn't long until they lost steam and plopped on the sand next to us, as we watched the sun drop, bleeding its colors to the final day's pastels on the water's reflection.

Overall great article.$$did the sea urchins thing :) did taste nice at that moment :)$$8 Things You Shouldn't Forget To Do When Traveling Around The Philippines.

1. Don't for get to get ripped-off my the Taxi Drivers at the Airports (MNL and Clk mostly.) The same with Trike Drivers at Tourist spots. It may not be much for you. But that amount of money could be as much as some poor guy breaking his back in a rice field.

2. Don't forget the food Totally SUCKS; Caveat the street Chicken or some BBQ.
If you can't make you‚Äôre own food there, ask expats where to find decent food.

3. Don't learn the Language; you'll be wasting your time, unless you stay in one place or with a group of friends. There's three different Languages here -- plus English. English is the 'common' language. If you don't know English, learn that one.

4. If you miss home, go to a mall... Half the Malls here are very nice... The other half are like something you'd see in  developed countries 40-years ago.

5. If you make new friends, realize they share an OZ of beer with you, they'd expect 16 OZs in return.

6. 'Keep it Clean.' There's trash and shit all over the place here... but, us foreigners don't really litter anyway.

7. Support the locals, but, not the Tourist Scammers (Taxi, Street People, and whatnot.) You can go to the local Sari-sari (small, rustic, 'convinces' store.) and buy what you can from there. They're regular families working, trying to make a honest living in a place that is difficult to do so. 

8. SMILE... Like many country‚Äôs in SE Asia. The here people like you... I think because you are different and come from a different place??? Isn‚Äôt that why you like them and are there???

 #MyVisitKoreaStory$$#MyVisitKoreaStory from July 2016 is a different kind of travel story because it is not about nature, the grand palaces or the unique food in Korea. This photo is inside the venue of a concert I attended in the Olympic Stadium. It was a very memorable experience to be joining the fan chants while EXO performs. During this trip I also got to know fans from U.S., Australia, Japan and France and knowing that Korean pop music has inspired them enough too to make a trip to Seoul. This trip made me see the intense K-pop culture of the youth while still being friendly towards foreign fans. This was a very different trip for me because I used to make trips to immerse myself into Korea's nature, busy shopping streets, art cafes and grand palaces. This was a trip that made me closer to my fandom and also fulfilled my wish of watching my favorite K-pop group right there in their home country. Truly, a beautiful memory I will always keep with me.$$My first trip to Korea with my daughter's! It was a dream come true. I was born in Korea and went back when I was little. I wanted to go back with my mother but she passed away in 2008. I always told my daughter's that we would go to Korea and it finally happened this year.  It would be awesome to go back and see the rest of the country of my mother. #MyVisitKoreaStory  May 2016$$#MyVisitKoreaStory Having to immerse in their local culture I decided to try out their street food stalls which is really fun. Seeing the friendly lady cooking for me and the grilled aromatic of the fresh seafood and meat just simply makes my stomach growling really loud which lucky the Locals beside me are too busy chatting away.$$Photo was taken when autumn season in November 2015 that was my last day for trip of korea. Feel like at home. I am fall in love with korea at the first sight when i saw a drama Autumn in My Heart. This country is so beautiful and makes me always wanna go there. I will waiting for my lovely Knight and go back there to lock our love forever.

#MyVisitKoreaStory$$I am from Indonesia, a tropic country where it has only two seasons: dry season and wet season. Therefore, I have a dream willing to experience other seasons like spring, winter and autumn in different country. Then I choose South Korea for my autumn experience. Here, I went there on last October 2015. I visited Soeraksan and Nami Island. Those places were fullfiled with yellow ginkgo and red maple trees where the leaves falling everywhere. It was definitely beautiful. I never see maple and ginkgo before because they doesn't grow in Indonesia, and finally I touched them. Love it! #MyVisitKoreaStory$$I want to participate this event. I has uploaded my photo not sure that I'm do it the correct way or not cos I didn't see my post at Korea Tourism Organization webpage, kindly let me know I'm successful posted.$$Samcheongdong Hanok definitely caught my attention the moment I stepped on there. That place is simply picturesque and while in pictures it may not look interesting but trust me, the moment you reach there you really want to take as many pictures as possible and keep all the memories forever with you because that place just looks so beautiful and stunning. #MyVisitKoreaStory$$I was in Gyeongbokgung Palace back in this May and it's one of the most important and beautiful site to visit while in Seoul. The view inside the palace just looks stunning and it's pretty big place too walk around too. The construction and roof tiles is definitely unique and artistic for the ancient palaces. There is also a museum and there are just so many things to see and of course many pictures to take too :D. I'm looking forward to visit Gyeongbokgung again in another season during winter when the view is completely different from Summer. #MyVisitKoreaStory$$#MyVisitKoreaStory This meal at Jinokhwa Halmae Wonjo Dakhanmari is situated at an alley at Dongdaemun (ÎèôÎåÄÎ¨∏) never failed to erase off my memory for the best delicious chicken pot that can be so exciting with the variety of condiments, kimchi, rice cakes and noodles that surprisingly from a plain chicken hotpot that can magically turn into the best Chicken Hot pot that I ever tasted in my whole life. It was the most memorable dish for me and certainly I been craving and wanting to go back there to indulge again.  #KoreaTourismOrganizationVisitKorea$$#MyVisitKoreaStory from October 2015

Autumn is my favorite season and it is unfortunate that we don't experience it in the Philippines. That's why on my first solo trip during autumn in Seoul, I took the time to visit Seoraksan located in the nearby province of Seokcho. I reached this beautiful mountain via the Dongbu bus line. Upon reaching the foot of the mountain where the trails begin, the orange and yellow leaves of the trees of Seorak are already visible. There are a lot of hiking trails and you can choose from which way to begin by the signages. I went to Biryong falls, Myeonsangil path, path to Biseondae rocks and Sinheungsa temple. Although I was not equipped enough to go to Ulsanbawi where the famous rigged stony trail is found on the way to the summit. It was a very manageable day hike for my first time hiking the trails alone. The tension bridge in the picture leads to a falls located deeper into the hiking trail. I plan to be back in spring and explore the nearby places around Seokcho.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

From Daegu you can take a bus to Hainsa Temple and see Tripitaka Koreana - the world's most ancient storage facility of Buddhist scriptures - fascinating. Jeonju another interesting city and you can wander around the Hanok village all day, lots of tea houses and craft shops. Be sure to try bibimbap - specialty of that area.

Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name ‚ÄúBantayan sa Hari‚Äù (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to ‚ÄúBantayan,‚Äù the name it's known as today.

We leave our empty drinks in our movie cinemas seats. Random tissue papers are always floating on MRT seats. We choke drains with our cigarrates. And we don't even think twice about it. Because garbage on the street is better than in our pockets. 

Some of us have become so entitled that we say we ""help"" the cleaners by giving them a ""job"" to do. That's when you know something is wrong. Maybe that's why we don't return our food trays.

I'm guilty for being part of those groups at parties who don't clean up well, leaving cleaners with a ton of extra work to do. It seems normal when no one seems to care. But I'm not going to act that way again.

I recall with fond memories when I was young and going to the omni theatre with family. The excitement builds up as I queue to get in so as to get the best seats in the house. Usually I will sit close to the projector in the middle of the room and marvel at how it rotates. The film are short and we will then walk to a room of exhibitions and learn about science , solar system etc. About 7 years ago, I went again and was sadden by how run down the omni was and in an era of digital films, omni is no longer a draw. I look forward to the new revamped omni theatre and bring back it's glory! Please pick me!$$Always remember going to the science centre when I was a child,  but never to the omni theatre! Really hope to win the entry and bring my love one there to experience and enjoy how technology has advanced!

Read his straightforward, honest assessment of the country and let us know your thoughts! 

http://www.idreamedofthis.com/2013/11/27/what-i-really-think-of-the-philippines/Heartfelt (and hilarious) observations after living in the Philippines for a year.","I'm not confused. I love it here, retired in Cebu for a year & half now, did take me a while to just slow down after 35 years in San Francisco Bay Area, have been all over Cebu Bohol Negros Oriental and the best Palawan. Yes poverty is pervasive but the Filopino people are the friendliest most humble on the planet.$$Wonderful article and very honest about these remarkable people. I have been blessed to have married a beautiful Phillipino women ha and family. She is an incredible wife. I plan on retirement in the fils. Slow my life down and love and support my aswa with all my heart.$$I've been to Manila and Cebu. I loved them both and especially fell in love with the joy of the people who live here. üòç$$This is just garbage written by a woolly-brained American liberal wracked with misplaced white guilt. The Philippines is fine. Happiness isn't about material wealth at all--though wealth is great! 

And the wonderful thing is, the economy in the Philippines is about to boom. Many many people are going to experience so many good things very soon there. They have finally solved the only real problem they ever had: Corrupt thieves posing as politicians.$$I've also been there for a month living with the people living in the privince and witnessed some city boys and girls begging for money on every corner in the cites. Yes people in the province were different. I heard they emphasize happiness over financial richness several times. Meanwhile I got some chances to talk privately with the young girls (not the boys) then I noticed some different inner sides and desires. They mostly said that they wanted to live in a bigger house and hoped that they would be able to go abroad to live a richer life with modern environment. Briefly speaking they said they want to live in a more modern style than now. Of course they said they are happy with the current life with their family members and relatives but deep inside I found that they yearn for some different lives as in the TV dramas or in some films. Happiness is indeed something relative. If the girls hadn't seen any more developed coutries and lives first or secondhand they would be perfectly content with their recent lives. But the opposite is the case for those girls living in the 21th century. I come to an conclusion which is half subjective and half objective that people in PH have two inner sides in one of which they are really happy despite of lack of money and in another they hope for a better more modern life now.$$This is just purely an opinion from a foreigner who is just merely comparing Phil and his home country- just his personal unsolicited observation. In anyway doesn't represent the Filipino culture as a whole. Indeed Westerners have high standard of living but working at least 16 hrs a day with two or three different jobs just to be able to pay their taxes, bills and credit cards for a lifetime!!! I still choose the Filipino way.$$Was in the Philippines two times now. Loved it and plan to come back. Have friends there and i see how hard their life is! As in any country in the world there is light and darkness....till now i had no bad experiences and hope the next trip will be as wonderful as before. Im thankful to read about other peoples trips and how they see things. Looking forword to go back and see more places!$$Thank you for being true in your observation and expressing your feelings about our country and I'm glad you saw the good and bad side of it with an open mind and an open heart....I applaud you for your post and you are more than welcome to come and visit our beautiful country again and again...God Speed$$I've been to Philippines two times now. I love it! I'm married to Filipina and one day would love to retire there. Very good article!$$The Philippines is my most favourite destination. The beauty of Bohol and friendly people makes me excited to come back soon. I have also encouraged my friends not to look past it with so much to explore, but no balut for me !!!$$Nice, honest and candid of Mr Allen's stay in the Phil. 

Thank you for both the great and challenging stories you shares. Visit Phil again. 

Ps: this article was written three years ago.$$Nathan Allen is like Kyle Jennermann or more popularly known as ""Kulas"" who's a Canadian and loves it in the Philippines so much. Thank you guys for loving my country!$$I pretty much agree with you, on everything. Even though,  I've been going to the Philippines for the last 10 years, and my wife is from Luzon, I really enjoy the warmth of the Filipinos!
They are all about family, which, as Americans we have seemed to have forgotten, this.
I can't wait to retire in 6 years!$$dear tourism phl, The Philippines you might want to take a look and do something about him being declared as persona non grata in sorsogon. üòí its not fair to him when he genuinely loved the philippines üôÇ

Teary eyed when done. Tsada magpuyo dri no? Salamat sa pag appreciate sa Pilipinas. God bless you more. Take care always.$$The parts about America are somewhat true. I never felt I needed to buy a Starbucks to fit in, maybe I am different but if you can't afford it then don't buy it. Many Americans agree with me and don't feel pressure like this author feels. If you don't want it don't buy it.$$This guy really doesn't understand piany, he judges from a perspective of America, and mo own experience's there seeing poverty, seeing  poor helping the poor, and people with job's help as well, hindi one can judge a country from a year! Only being born and raised there, to know the truth, that's the true story of a The culture dynamic there north and south.$$Nothing new here, all Americans are confused! üòÇ

The poverty is just hidden better in the USA.$$Adam Marshall you should read this. And I mean read, not just skimming it.

When I read this, it was as if I was traveling. :D$$Quite an impressive page. :) :) You did a good job in describing our culture here. I hope you can go back and observe/explore other areas/islands of my country that remains untouched and they are just waiting to be seen. Next time, maybe you can visit the Eastern side of the country, wherein they have different language and somewhat different cultures, not to mention good places to visit too. :) :) Cheers!$$Yea...i dont think hes confused.

7879,340785907491_169975589769512,Traveling in Seoul by subway just became a little easier for foreign tourists! http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/FU/FU_EN_15.jsp?cid=1522312Public transit pass for foreign tourists launched,"Can it be used in other cities too like the T-Money card?$$Sorry Adrian, it can only be used for the Seoul metropolitian area subway lines.$$what the difference betweem M-Money & T-Money??$$That's even better...looking for it during my summer trip this year :D$$There must be some mistake with the price?!? Who will take more than 10 rides a day (roughly equalling the value of a day pass) and also given the fact that there are no busses included...am I missing something?
Its so bad, especially for Koreans, that there is no proper daily, weekly or monthly tickets for public transportation in Seoul. Ticket fares seem to be cheap, but it adds up, if you have to commute every day..$$As excited as I am to see Seoul putting effort into doing something good for foreigners, I am inclined to agree with Paul. As someone who doesn't live in Seoul, but likes to go for weekends and holidays, I cannot see myself ever making this pass to be financially efficient. It seems like a LOT of money. If it were up to me, I'd lower the price to 5,000 won a day, and lower the number of possible rides to 10 or 15 a day (not including line transfers, those should not be counted.) I have NEVER known a foreigner to take more then 10 subway trips a day, let alone meet the maximum number of 20.$$Hmm it does seem a little expensive for a day pass - I love the Metro in Seoul - but the best way to see Seoul is walk around its amazing what you miss between stations! 20,000won on a T Money card can  last about a week for me!$$Mufizah- The M-pass allows you to make up to twenty trips in 1 day for 10,000 won, so it is ideal for travelers planning to take a large number of trips on the subway in one day because it gives a savings over the normal rate if you take more than 10 subway rides in a single day. However, it can't be used for buses or in other metropolitian areas, or recharged like a T-money card.$$I love Seoul subway !!!!! Nvr thought it will be easy till I 've tried it out last yr ;)$$That card is way to expensive. Most cities have cards that make up there value with only 3-5 rides. This one takes more than 10 to be worth it. Don't buy if coming to Seoul. $$...So not really a good option unless you plan to spend you day on the subway lol!$$Even then it might be cheaper to take the t-money, just take line nr. 1 all day :)$$Great idea and a huge help for travellers! Is there a similar thing for other cities in Korea?$$Hi Travel Bug! This is just for the Seoul subway.$$i already try it..it's fun & easy too..hehe..luv to try again next time$$I think this is actually a great idea!  This pass if for tourists coming into Seoul, a ride on the train from Incheon to Seoul Station is about 4,000 won one way and then you are forgetting  that base fare is 900 won with a card, and it increases as you travel over distance.  And think about tourists would don't necessarily realize that a destination is much closer walking than taking the subway for one stop?  I know people would rather feel safe knowing that they can take the subway for one stop and exactly know where they are when they exit the subway.

20 rides are day for 10,000 won is quite generous actually, since 10,000 won for Seoulites is only about 8 - 10 rides...$$Hi Ana! It is a day pass costing 10,000 won and is good for up to 20 rides in one day. So, as other people have commented, it saves you money only if you take more than eleven standard 900-won subway rides in one day.$$but 20 rides in a day? is it possible ? to around Seoul in a day ? but if p er ride about 4000 one way...hhmm will think about it :-), i think Beijing subway is more more cheap hehehe$$if i'm not mistaken,this what i've read from the guesthouse website.It takes about 53 minutes from Incheon airport to Seoul Station and the fair is 3,700won(Non-Stop train ; 13,300won)$$This is a great idea.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

No extra tickets required since you're continueing a journey and you already took public buses there. No need to go 30 minutes earlier and all that. Walking distance is roughly the same if you count walking to/fro/within the train station.

There's a reason why the people who travel in and out frequently, especially those who work here and stay there, hardly ever use the KTM shuttle.

Or. You could do a 'challenge. Have 2 of use either methods and see what happens.

Also, if you're using the train to go further (i.e. KL), get the tickets from JB side.

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn‚Äôt a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 ‚Äî known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It‚Äôs only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They‚Äôve got water and waves to spare.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Surigao (one hour), then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a bus from Manila or Davao to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Dahican Beach is widely popular beach destination for skimboarding. It's also a place for observing marine life, as dolphins, sea cows and sea turtles inhabit its waters.

Fun Fact: 
Kuya Jun Plaza is a native Dahican and founder of the Amihan Boys ‚Äì a group of the best skimboarders and surfers in the region. He doesn't only teach them how to get better at their sport, but also gives life lessons on how to stay away from vices and use their passions to help others. Try to meet him and shake his hand when you're in the area.

But is Sweden really better than Singapore? This Swedish guy made 2 videos to say: NO.

https://mustsharenews.com/singapore-sweden-videos/","I think Singaporeans take housing for granted the most. Across the world, house ownership is a pipe dream for an entire generation of millennials. Not to say housing in SG is perfect, but at least it's attainable.$$Having to visit Stockholm a month ago, I tend to agree that SG is better than Sweden (while I do like their architecture). Their cabs are insane, no regulations and touting for business and ridiculously priced. The licensed one that I took cost me S$80 from airport to city and the drive said unlicensed ones can cost up to S$200... Unlike other Scandinavian countries, people there don't seem to be as friendly or happier... Food and transport were also more expensive than Denmark and Finland, even public areas are dirtier than their 2 counterparts. So yeah, I'll pick SG anytime over Sweden$$Why bother to compare and say which is better? There will always be things that are better on 1 side but there will also be things that are worse. It's like when you are in school and got 89 marks for your test. And then your mom comes and say why u no like the other kid who got 92 marks and ignoring the fact that your 89 mark is actually the second highest, better than the other 30 kids in the class. Sigh....$$Be contented with what you have. Singaporeans complain too much. If singapore was so bad then please give up your space to someone who will appreciate it more.$$The grass is always greener on the other side, there's no perfect system of governance, just a better balance of left and right...$$Singapore is great if you can afford to uber everywhere like the  Swedish guy,  or afford private housing which that guy seems to ('much more attractive option anyway' or something like that)$$Sure you wanna compare?
... Singapore government taxes us More than 300 over percent for buying just a car, and that's exclude the earnings our local car dealers are profiting in the process$$Malaysia even much better than both countries provided you are not align to any politics here . Expatriates with their salaries have a wonderful life here.$$I think he forgot to compare salary vs living cost to yield expendable income, it is not fair to compare just area vs area without comparing the above. For vandalism and subway, I agree that SG is way better than any other country (except HK :P) due to absolute strict law. No cigarette butt due to strict law again. Glass door on subway station and the safety cone on construction area / road is for safety and to avoid subway company and government bodies being sued by passenger accident. While due to strict law, order is there always. This area Singapore always better than any other country in the world.$$Rubbish article. In SG, most of the time you do not own the property but rent it for 99 years.  And that is full rental payment up front upon signing the ""ownership"" lease.

Transport is easy becos we are a small city.  MRT?  Rofl!  Really?  Dun think all our MRTs have screen doors.  All of them started WITHOUT screen doors and we had our share of people being pushed or fell onto the tracks.

He should really do more research before posting this fake news.$$Might as well compare our houses to mansion houses and say we are deplorables? 

This goalpost changing where everyone has their own criteria is annoying.

Everyone wants the MRT to be better. Like common$$I have also lived in both countries and this article is so biased it is not even funny$$Cos they are treated special here with the Asians kowtowing to them??..Back, in Sweden, they are just common White..üòÇ$$Try stealing a chair in singapore lor... you can go jail and get fine... lol singapore so small where you gonna run ? And why would Singaporean wanna steal a chair that's worth $50-$100 when the fine is $2000 and get jailed... probably because Singaporean will think of consequences first before acting.$$He just tasting the icying on the cake.. wait till he gets the whole cake and see if Singapore is still sweet...$$Singaporeans take things for granted. Only if they have lived abroad for a few years will they then know its Great To Be Home (SINGAPORE). i HOPE THIS VIDEO BY STEFAN WAKES SINGAPOREANS UP ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG ONES.$$Housing and transport.

And people are already ordering Jesa foods anyway...","I used to read AAKs Blog hoping to understand Korean culture better now that I am living here, but was disappointed at how often he  unfavorably talks about US of A.

There were some really great blog posts and I followed the blog and facebook, too. But as the year passed I realized that I was upset by more posts than I enjoyed. Still, maybe I'm overly sensitive? Check out a few of his posts... he posts on a variety of subjects.$$I think the issue of sometimes critical opinions regarding america is something any expat of their country is bound to do with the country they've moved to. You notice a number of things- changes in courtesies, changes in formalities, food, discrimination, the list goes on. We went through this a lot in japan as exchange students- we had people that didn't want to sit next to us on occasion on the train, no one holds open doors in Japan (not out of an effort to be rude, but just because it's not part of their common courtesy), american versions of food outside of mcdonalds and hard rock were usually hilariously wrong, etc. We became very critical of Japan, not because we didn't like it there (we LOVED it there- many of my friends are already back), but because in talking through the harsh realities, it helped us cope and adjust to the differences. Many of our Japanese friends were slightly shocked at our perspectives on occasion, but they couldn't deny that there wasn't any truth to it. The Korea seems to do the same sort of thing, except this time the foreign country is america and america is full of changes he has to be critical of to understand and cope and adapt to. Perhaps I'm more understanding because I know where he's coming from, but instead of seeing it as a personal attack (which is far from what he probably intends), see it as an alternate perspective of someone who hasn't been ingrained in american culture since birth and therefore has a fresh perspective on perhaps some of the more harsher realities of living here. :)$$@Mary: Very insightful! I've seen both sides of it...people for the USA being very critical of Korea and many Koreans being critical of the USA. I think you may have hit the nail on the head...more than anything it may be a way to fit a new culture into their mindset more than an actual attack. However...there definitely is a limit too. I guess a lot depends on not just WHAT is said, but HOW it is said!$$^I agree! There are of course things you shouldn't say, but I've not seen anything written in this blog that seemed to absolutely cross the line with this sort of cultural reaction. I HAVE seen people cross it, and it's pretty obvious when they do. And generally most critiques about a country are kept amongst those who are collectively together in the new environment, not shouted from the rooftops, haha. The only time I had japanese friends of mine hear me speak about my own critiques is when I had to speak to a group of out-going american exchange students about what not to do and what to expect when going to Japan. Otherwise I don't generally talk about that sort of thing, haha. But since 'The Korean' has made an open blog about it, I can see how that might step on some toes of people who can't yet share the same perspective, but at the same time it's a good resource for learning relevant information from a down-to-earth point of view I think. :)",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

It's only 45 mins away from Tokyo by bullet train and now Sakura Festival is being held until 12th Feb.! So why don't you drop in at this city? You can enjoy spas and Mt.Fuji as well!

Starfish, also known as sea stars, are one of the most popular creatures on the sea bed. Although Palawan has a place called Starfish Island in Honda Bay, this particular orange starfish was found biding its time on Snake Island.

Fun Fact: 
The mouth of a starfish is found in its center. Though it's hard to imagine, these creatures have intestines and a stomach. But they also have an ability to digest food outside their bodies, and so can feed on prey much larger than their mouths.

When i get it, i am going to build a wolverine display so this claw would be displayed nicely in it.

I will be watching it with my wife Shonna Seow :) (pic of my claw)$$I read X-men comics since I was a little boy and I never got tired of it as new mutants keep popping out with their new special mutant ability and I believe that mutants really exists amongst us at that time. However, I'm an adult now and I know mutants exists only in another universe, the cinematic universe that is. However, that does not stop me from admiring Wolverine Aka Logan for his sense of justice and his determination to stand up for the right cause and to defend the weak. He is my idol and I wish to have the Replica claw as a symbol of justice and righteousness and to remind me to be a good person!
Let's watch Logan Jasmine Ong
Liked and shared too!$$I wanna win this Replica claw so badly! I had joined many contests that gave out the replica claws in the past few wolverine or X-men movies but without success. This Replica Claw from Logan might not be the last one as X-men movies will likely carry on for another few decades but it will be the last chance for me to own a replica claw that is used by wolverine played by Hugh Jackman. I wish to own one of the Replica Claw as a tribute to Hugh Jackman aka Wolverine and to remember him for playing the role  my favourite mutant all these years! I would like to watch Logan with Sit Ting Wen as this will be the final time Hugh Jackman will act as Wolverine!
liked and shared too!$$I want to win this giveaway because its very sad that this is Hugh Jackman's last movie for wolverine, so I hope to win this as my consolation prize to cheer me up a little and keep this as a memory that he is the best actor for Wolverine! <3 Gonna see with Julin Chua hehehe$$Hoping to win as I love all things X-Men and of all the characters, I always have a soft spot for Wolverine as he is the coolest and most loyal of all the mutants!! Keeping my fingers crossed!!! Liked and shared with Evelyn Tan$$have seen all the reviews for LOGAN and they've all been amazing (not surprised). truly can't wait to watch Hugh Jackman's final portrayal of Wolverine, it's the end of a great era and winning this (especially the t-shirt!) would make this film even more memorable for me :-)$$I want to win this giveaway as this is the last time that Hugh Jackman will be appearing on screen as Wolverine, so I want to have something to remember that this phenomenal actor once acted in such a great role. 

I will frame up the memento if it's the claws and wear it if it's the T-shirt! Hopefully it's the claws!

Would love to watch this with Theng Siong!$$I have been collecting wolverine items for years and I need this in my collection! It's something I definitely wanna get my claws on especially when it is also the very representation of Hugh Jackman's work on Wolverine! I'm definitely catching LOGAN with MicHelle Ang Xing Yee!$$I want this! The Replica Claw would be a perfect display at our new flat! This will make our entertainment room look outstanding! üòçüòç Love wolverine! Love X-men! Mike Lin and I will definitely be catching LOGAN! #HisTimeHasCome$$I liked Wolverine movies and XMen. Hugh Jackman would have agree too!! It is sad to see  this great character portray by Hugh Jackman to be his last of XMen Series. I hope to have his Replica Claw for souniver and make an enrage X claw pose. Alex Chew Wei Xiong$$Love xmen since childhood . Most of all my Favourite hero is wolverine ! Love his self healing abilities and not to mention his sharp razor claws ! 

Collecting its figurines, posters and collectables is my daily life routine. Never ever miss out the movies of xmen since it's debut.

What's more now I have the chance to own the exclusive claw which is like a once in a life time opportunity for me. 

It is not a want now. It's time for a need of this to add on to my collection and be part of my Favourite hero adventure !

Definitely catching it with Aaron Phoa over and over again !$$This is Jack Hughman's last outing as Wolverine so it would be memorable to win these movie premiums. 

Liked and shared! (Y) Elaine Chang$$Growing up, Wolverine was one lengendary character with a complicated storyline. This continuation of his story is something I would like to see! Amalus Barakna$$I want to win the Replica claw because it looks so cool and shiny! Logan is my favourite mutant as being a woman , I loved cooking and hence I dig knifes. So for Logan to have the claws coming out from his knuckles whenever he have a rage , it makes my heart flutterüò∂! This will be a unique and the centre of attention  piece among the collections of my kitchen knifes! 
Let's watch the sexiest man alive play the role of wolverine one last time Shi Min!
liked and shared!$$Saw the film today and I must say this is the best and my favourite of all wolverine and x-men movies. It's raw and bloody and Hugh Jackman last film as the animal wolverine.$$I wanna win this as we are watching ""Logan"" tonight.. we are so bringing a bunch of longan to eat in the cinema.. lol

8225,67558139928_10153705543249929,"Are you interested to explore the beauty of Indonesia? If so, there‚Äôs good news for you! The Indonesian government has given a free visa for 90 countries. #WonderfulIndonesia ","as Indonesian, i am ashame that the guy who made this picture didn't know that Czechoslovakia has disappeared since 1992 and the government of Indonesia gives an extended visa free to a defunct non-existent country. Come on Indonesia...$$I hope its vice versa for indonesian passport holder to visit those countries tho :D$$So the truth about the visa free entry,is that like most things jokowi has tried to do, the corrupt embedded systems have found away around it.  

The way corrupt immigration officials have managed to get around this one are:
1)reducing the 90 free visa (as it is in most of asean)  to 30 days then with a intrusive,  unfriendly,  nasty and corrupt extension possible at immigration offices. 
2)not providing it to the largest incoming tourist group in Bali, Australians,  because a) corrupt officials at the airport are so dependant on that cash coming in.  These are the same government officials who always guarantee there are not enough immigration officers working at anyone time at the Bali airport so that they can offer a discrete express service foe an extra  cash fee and b) just to childishly spite Australia, claiming it is because Australia does not reciprocate with free visa for Indonesians,  conveniently over looking that many many of the 90 countries on the list also don't offer free visas to Indonesians. 
3)only making it available at a few very specific ports of entry,  Jakarta,  Batam, Bali and maybe one or two others,  but yogya for example misses out, which is why some have written that they still had to pay. 
4)by going back to being much more strict on demanding that you already have a return ticket booked out of the country,  which is of course ridiculous in this modern age of last minute online cheap tickets from budget carriers like Air Asia. 

So yeah! Yep we have restricted and still unfriendly in welcoming very short visas foe some countries at some airports.  There is no doubt that is better than before,  but sadly like. Most things Jokowi has tried to do,  it has been watered down dramatically by the old guard, including Mega and JK,  Golkar and the rest of the embedded corrupt government cronies. 
Sad but true
And who loses 
As always outer Indonesia as noone stays long enough to get out there.$$Any valid information about this 90 daya free visa to Indonesia?$$I will visit Indonesia this Christmas. So no more on arrival visa?$$Indonesia is not an English speaking country anyways. Mistakes on the writing above are still forgivable. And it's understandable.$$Do you Interest = *Are you interested*

Earlier given Visa Free = *Visa exempted countries*

Is okay, mistakes do happens sometimes. Let's learn to forgive. :) Peace!$$the country providing the most turis turis to Indonesia is .... AUSTRALIA$$OK, So when will WNI can get at least VOA and don't need to make visa in advance for japan, South Korea, European country, USA, south & north America, and more???$$Shall we go Virzah?

Big thanks to everyone for participating, and to Quayside Isle for sponsoring this giveaway :)$$10 Reasons I would like to spend Christmas at Quayside Isle!

1. It's my birthday on Christmas!
2. I could never have a fancy meal around because everything is so expensive on Christmas!
3. I was actually intending to save some money this Christmas by staying at home so the husband don't have to spend so much..
4. As we are saving money for our future flat and can't afford a holiday..
5. Hence travelling to Quayside Isle could be like a 'getaway' from Singapore!
6. I have NEVER been to this side of Singapore....
7. And since I don't have a car and am saving money.. The transportation accommodation is perfect!
8. I've never splurge on fanciful Italian, Spanish or any International fare - Closest was vouchers from friends at Lawry's Prime Ribs.
9. Have you seen Rebel Wilson did that Hydro Jetpack thing?!
10. I REALLY WANNA WIN THIS! üò≠$$My QUAY reason is that it's a nice tranquil place to spend Christmas with family by my SIDE and therefore ISLE really like to go there!$$With Quayside Isle being such a Instagram-worthy place, the ""ulu"" distance ain't gonna stop me from going because we all know it's definitely WORTH IT! And why squeeze at Orchard Road when we can get to experience Xmas from all over the world at Quayside Isle, right?? Haha :D Plus the Xmas promotions & shopping...OMG it's literally the perfect mini getaway! Oh! And my family had a staycation at W last year; waking up to that insanely gorgeous yacht sea view was seriously a dream come true! Sentosa is always my happy place to be, which is why I'd LOVE to be able to spend Xmas at Quayside Isle this year!! There's just no other place I'd rather be!! :D Liked & shared! (Here's some photos that I took when I was at Quayside Isle! Now I miss this beautiful place so so much!) TheSmartLocal.com Quayside Isle @ Sentosa Cove$$I think it would be great to celebrate Christmas at Quayside Isle instead of the usual Orchard.  I love the sea, boats and beautiful scenery where I can take alot of nice selfes and wefies.  Would invite my Malaysian cousins for some delicious food  when they come to visit in Christmas. I'm sure they will love in love with the lovely place.  :D 
liked n shared$$I have not been to the  Quayside Isle before so it would great to have brand new experience this year  to create new memories with my loved one                 :3 
liked n shared$$Having been to Quayside isle several times , it is unlike like any other places Singapore , always packed and crowded with people . Having no time to travel out of Singapore during the xmas season, quayside isle is the best place to be at , to celebrate the festive season with our love ones, which will give us a out of Singapore feel.$$I hope to win this vouchers at Quayside Isle vouchers üòç 

I have never been to Quayside and I never thought it is so beautiful and less crowded as compared to town areas (especially during Christmas). Both my boyfriend and I hated squeezing in the crowd! It would be a great idea to spend my Christmas with my boyfriend Chua Hien Eng there which gives us the feeling of being out of Singapore during this festive season! As its really expensive to travel overseas during this festive season. With the awesome view, we can take many Instagram worthy photos together and have our mini photo shoot there! It would be great walking along Quayside Isle together hand in hand and spending quality time together. I believe this would be a great place for us to escape from our hectic life ‚ò∫Ô∏è$$Liked n shared . It's a different part of Singapore ... Where one can relax and chill away from the hustle and bustle of the city and the marina and yachts docked by Quayside isle bring waterfront to a whole different level !$$I‚Äôd like to spend Christmas at Quayside Isle because I have not been to this place, and it would be great to bring my wife to  Quayside Isle for a change in environment too. This place may bring new surprises to us.$$I'd like to spend this Christmas with our little one who will be turning 2 months soon. This would be his first Christmas! 

It would be lovely to spend it at Quayside Isle as a family. To enjoy the evening by having a sumptuous dinner & dessert in one of the restaurants and take a stroll along the quay afterwards for some photo taking time!

Let's hope to be chosen and make this first Christmas a special one for us, the Wongs :) üòò
Kyle Wong 
Ho Eleanor Ron Chng Pearly Ling Choo Ang Galvin Ng Lin Guan$$Its the perfect and tranquil place to spend the Christmas Eve over at Quayside Isle along with my significant other. Where we could just simply people watch or chat to our hearts content over what we had achieved in the year by the night lights and stars above.  Ahhhh~ I am so tempted to rush down just by the thought of it. Hope luck is on my side so that I can win the vouchers and truly enjoy my sumptuous dinner at any of the restaurant. Jonathan Tanüòò$$Because its a serene enclave from the hustle and bustle of the city and with paranomic views of the sea along with tantalising delights which I simply can't resist, why else but Quayside Isle right? :) 

P.S: Wasn't paid by CDL or its tenants to say this.$$Christmas has always been mundane/just-another-day for us since we never liked joining the crowds. Thus, I believe Quayside Isle is THE place to go if we'd like to enjoy some quiet time and soak in the Christmas festive at the same time!$$Spent a month working here during my post-As last year, and told myself i'd definitely be back - only this time to enjoy the gorgeous seaview with my family. But when uni started, i got carried away with the assignments, projects, hall commitments and suppers, and haven't been to quayside isle since. It's a year late but i'll be bringing them this dec, and it'll be really, really amazing if i could treat them to a good meal by the sea (freshly made, piping hot pizza? yes pls!!!) it'd be the perfect christmas getaway for us!!$$I had been to Quayside Isle before,it is so nice like overseas.The scenery is nice with sea,boata and nice scenery.I can take alot of nice pictures.$$Liked and shared
Hope to win can bring my wife and kids celebrate Christmas n my early birthday at a nice scenery and less crowded place.As bringing kids to crowded place inconvenient too.$$All I want for Christmas is to spend more time with my family and daughter. 

As a busy working mother,  ive definitely missed out on the time i spend with my family and missing some milestones achieved by my daughter. But when I come home, my daughter will run to the door and give me a big hug, and everything that's happened that day just melts away. We love food from Quayside Fish Bar & Bistro so it'll be great to have a party this Christmas at Quayside Isle @ Sentosa Cove
Liked and shared$$I love to bring my mother to have a wonderful time at the Quayside Isle.  Ever since she discharged from hospital, she has been at home and feeling bored so I like to treat her to a yummy meal and walk around the beautiful place and take some nice photos <3$$I‚Äôd like to spend Christmas with my husband at Quayside Isle because it's a beautiful and romantic place, especially during the Christmas season. The dining options look good too.$$A promise to a special someone: To keep her smiling everyday. To bring her experiences and memories that will last a lifetime. To keep the sparks and magic alive in every date. 

Celebrating Christmas at Quayside Isle is my next milestone to meeting this promise. Help me fulfill it.$$I‚Äôd like to spend Christmas at Quayside Isle because it's definitely a better alternative compared to the crowded town area. Other than feeling like you are outta Singapore, having a quieter Christmas will be good. :)$$There was once where my wife and I were ""stuck"" among the crowds at Orchard Road during Christmas day. It was a horrible experience.So now, we would rather spend a quiet and peaceful Christmas day together at home. We did not know of any happening events at Quayside Isle, and also the place is quite far from our home and may be a little too quiet for us. I am looking for some place new for us to visit and after reading the website, I'm keen to go there for our Christmas celebration this year. It seems like a secret place hidden in Singapore with gems inside!$$I would like to spend this Christmas at Quayside Isle as it would be an unique experience for my friends and I. We usually hang out in bars or pubs and after so many years, it is time for a change. A different and exotic silent night!

http://www.positivelyfilipino.com/magazine/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-kapampangansHow best to understand the natives of Pampanga Province.","I lived and worked in Angeles, San Fernando and Dau near the bus terminal last 2010 working as part of the marketing team of a Makati hotel trying to capture the kapampangan market. This blog has probably captured the true description of this culinary center yet often misunderstood people& province. I only got to taste authentic homegrown kapampangan cooking when I got invited to a wedding in a barrio in Arayat. It was lavish for a barrio wedding with everyone helping in. And all the foods were truly the famous cabalen home cooking I've been hearing of. I specially liked the sweet adobo meat & when they told me it's a dog, I turned my eyes on the duck, prawn and pork menus.haha. We dipped in the cold springs of Mt.Arayat. For me, that wedding was the focal point of my Pampanga sojourn.$$Yes, it is very true that
""Kapampangans are deeply religious which, of course, is not the same as spiritual. Their fetish for anitos (spirit idols) has morphed into an excessive, almost irrational, devotion to anything associated with their colonizers‚Äô religion. Kapampangans have found their new idols on which to lavish their affections: the church temple for which they‚Äôd spend any amount to build, rebuild and renovate; the retablos and santos (altars and icons) which they over-decorate, over-dress, and over-process; and of course their priests whom they over-revere to the point of electing one as governor.""

The many details enumerated above made Bro Eli Soriano, who is not a Kapampangan, stay in this province and dare to focus his efforts to preach the Biblical Gospel of Christ, even if the teachings of our Lord and Saviour that he trumpets are often the exact opposite to the idolatrous Catholic teachings given to the local populace.

The ADD Convention Center was later built in Apalit to continue the banner television and radio program named Ang Dating Daan, and with the mercy and grace of God, thousands of Kapampangans have left the catholic faith and joined the 100% Bible-based Church of God.

The ethnic diversity is shared in the myriad colours in traditional wear, the culinary delight that is shared by all and the warmth welcoming hospitality greeted you as you travel around Malaysia .

Malaysia has lots of facinating places which could reduce our stress life in Singapore$$I love to travel to KL and its outskirts.   It offers both new modern shopping centres of mega scales like One Utama or Midvalley to Hypermarkets like Tesco to wholesale like Kenaga etc and yet you can find diversity in old shops in many areas to pasar malam in different vicinity and the open markets like in Jalan Ara.  Simply love the mood when I can go slow or at a fast pace,  the crowd yet you don't find it claustrophobic , the buzz and lively atmosphere you may find at Pavillion dining boulevard close to midnight and above all I felt relaxed each time I am there.  

The main draw for me is the food scene and you are spoilt for choices.  Each time I am there I never fail to make new discoveries and I am so often thrilled by the gem of the new found place and the smacking good food it offers.  

I indulged in the many nice hotels that abounds in KL and I am a frequent customer of Prince Hotel, my favorite accommodation in KL for its image, service, accessibility and proximity to the shopping belts and a short walk away from the midnight movie that I catch at the Pavillion.

Stopping over in Malacca for the foodie lover and moving on to Kuala Lumpur to indulge more in local food and shopping.

The former Braddell-Westlake Secondary School has been abandoned since 2005, and as with abandoned places, eerie vibes here are at an all-time high.  The amazing thing about this place? Unlike most abandoned places, the gates here are opened with the disclaimer ""Enter at your own risk"" instead of ""Trespassers will be prosecuted."" Yay!

Graffitied walls, shattered windows and dusty floors are a dead giveaway on this place‚Äôs inhabitants. Or lack thereof. One more desolated location to check off your photography bucket list!

Pasay, Metro Manila

What is it like? 
On the first day of September, the Filipino Christmas season unofficially begins. Christmas trees and star-shaped lanterns start to fill the streets. Schools start to put together plays about the birth of Jesus Christ. Christmas remixes of the year's most popular songs start to play on the radio. The whole country is transformed for a solid four months. It's the longest Christmas celebration in the world. And it also has a good claim to being the happiest. 

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
Adults or children form groups and visit homes at night to sing carols. When given change, young carolers typically sing a thank-you song in Filipino that goes, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so kind, thank you!"" When given change money, the song changes to, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so stingy, thank you!""

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/wtf-review

Model: Symone Maria Oei ","Went once out of curiosity and never going again for multiple reasons.

Dogs are very food-motivated. So dont expect any of them to pay you much attention unless you are willing to fork out extra for a pack of treats to bribe them into giving you some affection. (No promise they'll give you much either. Given how often they get to chow down on them.)

Secondly, animals need time to grow accustomed to you. When I visited, a regular stepped in and immediately all the pups darted towards her.üôÅ All the other people there had no choice but to sit in the corner and sorta just watch from afar. Not pleasant. But nothing we could do about it either.

After one experience I figured it'd be much more worthwhile to volunteer at an animal shelter to interact with pups who desperately want and deserve love too. (And will likely much more willingly give you love.)

Having a dog myself, I know how much stress dogs can relieve and how affectionate they can be. Dogs are great. But dont exploit them.
Putting them in an environment like this spoils them to the core and will deteriorate their character in the long run.

Edit: Try visiting Mutts and Mittens instead.‚ò∫Ô∏è$$Basically u need to buy treats in order for the dog to stay by ur side for u to touch and interact... If not u will be just wasting money ($10.90 entrance fee) and time there looking at the dogs walking by... I rather go to my relatives and friends house to interact with their dogs (no treats needed) and relieve stress there...$$I don't like the idea of buying treats from the shop in order to attract the doggies. Too much treats are bad for dogs. And are the treats healthy? Eg, dehydrated treats, home made treats etc?$$Just go visit a dog shelter and donate food to the dogs that really need your love and attention. Crappy cafe that exploits animals sucks$$why support this kind of cafe who use animals to make money? There are many dog shelter whose dogs needed more love and attention. Also imagine these pedigree dogs are like clowns waiting to be stuffed with treats...you think it is healthy to be eating treats all the time?$$YueKit Kwan entrance fee is like $10.90/2hrs ($7.90/hr extra) and if you dont buy treats, the dog wont even let you pet them.
Treats itself aldy cost $3/pack and $9 for 4packs. Even if you go there many times, people who bought the treat will always get the dogs attention. So, buy it or leave it.$$The dogs there are not friendly , i almost got hurt when i trying to pet one , me and my boyfriend just go there waste our time and play some games they provided.... 

Ps: even dog shelters or SPCA dogs are friendly to let you pet........ this is shit.....they shld train the dogs more$$I went there once with my boyfriend, bought 2 packets of treats and the dogs still didn't  give a flying f* about us LOL. They took the treats, moved away when we tried to pet them and walked away once we stop feeding. üòÖ Not worth a visit in our opinion.....$$With or without treats it's
really hard to get the dogs to come to you. Lola is one dog that had bad experiences with strangers who just carry her without basic respect of being gentle. You gotta be some kind of God blessed dog whisperer to really have fun. I wasted my $25 though. The pinch is real.$$Went there once. Yes the dogs mostly give you attention if you have treats, but after awhile when they get sleepy they'll crawl into the first person's lap they see, and they pretty much stay there and snooze till you need to move your numbed legs$$Omg why the hate for this place. These are DOGS. They obviously will be treats motivated. Don't worry abt the dogs being overfed. The owners calculate the packs of treats at the end of the day and feed them accordingly. None of them are overweight despite this cafe being opened for years so yea obviously something is being done right.get the pups to do tricks for their food, they are super cute and smart. 

I go there often and I see people grabbing the tiny pups and forcing them to take selfies w them üôÑ do u think that these pups are going to be v fond of u?? Be gentle with them and naturally some of them will be drawn to u. I personally have no trouble luring one or two dogs to snooze/play w me (ps Lulu is a sweet heart ‚ù§Ô∏è) just be patient and visit more often hahaha. 

WTF if ur reading this, please please please come up w yearly membership price üòÇI would totes buy it ‚úåüèªÔ∏è$$The first and only time I visited, most of the dogs were being hogged by some visitors (sleeping on their laps for almost the entire time I was there). So you just end up looking at them and the few dogs left walking around who will mostly ignore you unless you have treats. Waste of money.$$Bad experience there after just one visit. Went there on my birthday but I was sorely disappointed because the dogs do not come to you unless the staff gives u some treats. Extremely boring. Expect to be sitting around looking at the dogs from afar if u do go. I'd much rather go to the local dog shelters where the dogs welcome anyone, regardless of treats.$$lol Prerna Wangnoo i just read the comments and i think u shld just come and meet my dog instead... i charge u half the entrance fee and don't even need treats my dog will fly to u!

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one üòÇüòÇ damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london üòçüòç my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it üòÇ$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin ‚Äì Singapore‚Äôs 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy! It's the most unforgettable dining moment.$$There's this place where you pick what food you want, and it get delivered to you like a speed train on a conveyor belt after the chef has finished your order.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Boracay, Aklan

How to Get There:
""Fly from Manila to Caticlan.

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan.

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.""

What is it?
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact:
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

Travel Malaysia 2012 focuses on travel to Malaysia as an attractive holiday destination for travellers looking for a mid-year getaway.
Whether you're looking for the unspoilt beaches of Langkawi, the colonial heritage of Penang and Melaka, or the shopping and recreation in Kuala Lumpur, Travel Malaysia will have something for you! See ya there...  ‚ùÅ‚óï ‚Äø ‚óï‚ùÅ ","Hi guys. Just a feedback. My family and I have been wanting to explore Trengganu and its beautiful islands for quite some time now. But honestly, we have shelved the idea as there is no direct flight to Kuala Trengganu from either Changi Airport or Senai. At present the flight to Trengganu via KLIA is a no brainer as its involves a stop-over and price-wise, fyi, it is cheaper for us to fly to Koh Samui or Phuket. On the other hand, we will not travel by bus as the journey is impossibly long for our kids. So while we want to support tourism in Malaysia, I think its about time for MAS, Firefly or Airasia do the right thing! I am hoping for a positive response as I do want to see more success in the tourism sector in East Malaysia which has lots of potential and is indeed an untapped market at present. Thanking you in advance.$$Dear Naharudin Shariff, thank you for your feedback. As we would always encourage airlines to support,it is entirely up to their discretion on whether to travel to any routes.

It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

You in first turn have would help me,, as coach - a disabled person, his brother in spirit and lifestyle of Bushido, which for the sake of the memory of our spiritual teachers Sosai Oyama - more than 30 years of promoting your culture in the face of Kyokushin and free teaching children and youth, and Kyokushin helping children - disabled. Let's connect and brothers help me save the little girl who needs our help, and remember, that you Japanese not-to-face refuse help me, because you are Japanese and this says it all. Oss!!!

Brothers and sisters, Feb. 10 in Paris, Darya Glazkova( Dasha) had a third operation on the brain. The operation was successful, but happened complications of small excerpt and girls delayed in hospital for another week for the treatment and survey. Brothers Japanese and friends - people of good will, the family baby needs your help and support and I ask you for the sake of the memory of our spiritual teachers Sosai Oyama and other Martial Arts and all that is holy for you to help the family Dasha - who as you can. 50 or 100 euros for you it's not money that would do for your family weather, and for family Dasha and for most Dasha - is the ability to save lives. Help save the baby, and remember, that your help child, it you are helping themselves, because it a matter of honor for you, as the pioneers of lifestyle and other Kyokushin Martial Arts which is equal to the world of military brotherhood and self-respecting Japanese person - never refuse to help me coach - disabled (which is at the cost of their health, honor and prosperity - more than 30 years, defended and promoted your culture today needs your help) and a small child and I believe in you, brothers. The required amount of money help purely for the operation - 9700 (nine thousand seven hundred) EUR, together with additional costs due to the complication and unforeseen circumstances: extension of the course treatment for a week, pay for the travel, residence of parents, food, payment of an interpreter - in total about - 20,000 (twenty thousand) euros. 

I know that I have no right you order, but I can not keep and quiet, because we are brothers in spirit and way of life of Kyokushin and other Martial Arts and tomorrow on my place or place this child may be you or your child (do not let God) and you'll need the help of others and in this case you will have the right to call someone to help you and you are not afraid, that people just refuse help you - as refuse and you, because no one in this life itself does not survive, because people are always helping each other and it God's law which has not been canceled and have whether you're right - it is ignored? Here and think as you be brothers and yes helping you God and your conscience take the right decision.

The island is famous for its virgin beaches and secret swimming spots. But the thing about Siquijor that probably resonates the most is its reputation for magic and sorcery.

Local healers can concoct potions made from oils and herbs for visitors to take home. A scented lana (coconut oil-based ointment) made by a healer is believed to be relieve one of stomach aches and body pains.

Calle Crisologo is considered the Philippines' most beautiful street. It's paved with cobblestones and lined with well-preserved Spanish ancestral homes. Strolling along this part of Vigan is like traveling back through time. Kalesas (horse-drawn carriages) are also common sightings.

Calle Crisologo is one of the five places in the Philippines that have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Fun Fact:
An urban legend in Vigan tells the story of a Japanese general who fell in love with a Filipina who lived there. He married her, and they had a family.

A big thank you to everyone who participated, and to GEOX for sponsoring this giveaway. Head down to the nearest outlet for their ongoing sales this weekend!$$Liked, Shared and love to win $100 GEOX voucher! I had a first pair of GEOX years ago, it was so comfy, and i would love to win a new pair cos the old one was worn to bits :p I could see that a new pair of GEOX boots will keep me warm when i travel to cool climates!!! :)$$Subscribed, liked & shared! I always have trouble on what shoes shall I pack when I travel. Thanks to this post, I am sure going to get a Geox product regardless if I win the voucher or not. But with the voucher, it certainly allows the let me have more pairs!$$When creating a pair of shoes, it is often a struggle between form and function. Not many can strike that fine balance between form and function -- GEOX shoes stand out not only because they have mastered this balance, but they have upped the ante by adding comfort to its highest possible level. 

I have never owned a pair of GEOX before but I truly believe that GEOX lives up to its name as I have seen a pair of GEOX that has been with my friend for almost 10 years. I want to win this GEOX voucher so that I can have a chance to experience this kind of relationship with a shoe! And then influence another person to get GEOX! Thanks in advance for this opportunity!$$Subscribed, liked & shared. Nope, I'm not winning this for myself. I'd like to win this for my mother. She would be traveling to Japan next month and the climate there is said to be really cold. She has never seen snow in her 62 years of living and she intends to wear her track shoes there as she's a thrifty woman. Therefore I sincerely hope to win this voucher so that I can buy her a pair of winter boots to keep her feet warm when she travels to Japan next month. That's the least I could do as a daughter I suppose and not let her wear track shoes while walking in the snow (: happy 2016 to you guys anyway! Cheers*!$$I should win this because Chiang Mai is a lovely place and I'm singing its praises because I have been to this city, had memorable memories and would love to return again. With its breezy mountain weather, cheap food and many cultural places of interest. It's amazing and way better than Bangkok if you are more into the Arts and Cultural sort of person. I did participate in the festivals like Loi Krathong (floating the boat on water) and Lanna (floating lanterns), it's awe- inspiring. And I wish to return to experience the wonder sight of the Sakura blooming and check off my bucket list too!$$I would like to win this for a very special someone Samantha Lee. She is my fiancee. She likes to travel around the world with me. She can definitely have this pair of boots to walk the world with me. Really hope to win this for her.$$I have been travelling a lot and realised that having a good trusty pair of shoes for travel is very important. Many times I have to pack like a pair of sneakers, pumps, slippers etc into my luggage which takes up a lot of space and weight, not forgetting those bulky thick winter coats when travelling to cold countries. Geox is a trustable brand for its comfyness which is stylish, at the same time, to match with all types of outfits! With this pair of boots, I don't have to worry about packing so many shoes into my luggage anymore! Hope I can win this and own my first pair of Geox! üòäüôÜ$$I should win because I only wear GEOX's shoes after I have foot problems.

Even Timberland boots only lasted maximum of 3 hours of walking for me when I travel. I hope to find a pair of boots that can lengthen the amount of time I can walk during my travels üòÄ.$$travelling for work and pleasure is hard to balance but this pair of geox would really make trips much less tiring! can't wait to see how far they can take me to see the world :)$$I owned a pair of GEOX shoes when  I was working in the hospital wards. Translate the 8 hours walking about daily for One Year. It outlasted two other pairs of shoes that I had. Amazing!!. I shall be looking for another pair this year to take me on a trekking vacation.. ahhh GEOX...$$Liked and shared. I should win as I am a big fan of GEOX especially because of its  technological innovation and Italian style. Geox's footwear exemplifies this style and innovation, thanks to original designs and exceptional breathability. In Geox shoes and boots, a patented system consisting of a microporous membrane placed on top of a perforated rubber sole allows heat and humidity to escape from my feet, and keeps the shoes fresh and comfortable all day. :D Despite this enhanced breathability, many Geox shoes and boots remain waterproof and that's crucial living in Singapore where it can rain anytime anywhere! :)$$Liked & Shared! I wish to win this because a pair of waterproof boots is important to me as I love to explore places with wet terrain and not to mention that my feet would be able to breathe in them too!$$like and shared. would like to win a pair of winter boots for upcoming trip in New Zealand! heard that GEOX boots are light and comfortable!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

This is just my personal opinion, and I'm open for enlightenment. I might be missing something.

For me, keeping themselves like that makes them more vulnerable to deceit and maltreatment, which is then consequently detrimental over the areas (natural resources, ancestral land, culture) within their right and responsibility. Making themselves distant over the idea of progress and us encouraging them to keep it that way is a contributing factor over many issues concerning discrimination, land grabbing, over-industrialization, and even environmental harms. My proposal is to instead of encouraging them to keep a tribal nature, let's (the government and the people) make way for them to be part of an educated progress and development so that corporate greed would not swallow them whole. Think about it. I mean, sure, it all sounds well and good but ... what is the significance of ethnic tribes in our modern society? They're not animals, people. They're human beings. We shouldn't encourage them to keep it that way just because they ""look nice"". It's like keeping them in a psychological zoo by telling them it's okay to keep tribal traditions above modern beneficial progress. My point is that we should aim to educate them so that they would be more well-equipped to protect their culture and environment.$$The tribe collect sea cucumbers (pictured) and dry them to be sold on the foreign market, which Maentz found would sell for the equivalent of $83 a kilo.

Where the hell was their PRS on 1st, 2nd and 3rd June from 10:00 AM to 10:05 AM? 
 .
 .
 As if the PRS was not working, then how the tickets could be regretted during that period? 
 .
 . 
 Who should answer ?... Indian Railway, IRCTC or the airlines company.. 
 .
 .
 Prestige's.. I m regularly bomb shelled by checking the PRS system from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM. The review of activity is like this
 [
 10:00 AM-10:05 AM The PRS system is failed in all India. Still the tickets sold during that period.. this is illogical and bit to surprise.

10:05 AM-10:25 AM a common IRCTC user mainly face a problem related to the payment gateway. 

10:25 AM-12:00 PM Everything becomes normal, if u call the customer care executive.. they will ask for the problem screenshots. And that is resolved in 2 months

I checked the airlines after. The ticket is became costlier than 15,000/-, so, I think its better to fly London or Singapore instead of flying to Ranchi from New Delhi. The prize is even same.

Why do you think they made a statue of a dog? ","That is a good theory!  Do you have a dog statue in your backyard Tina?  hehe  I should have one... my dear puppy passed away last year.  

Marie$$aww I'm sorry to hear that....don't have a backyard yet but I really couldn't tell you why they have a statue of a dog....might be significant in some way but dogs are always loyal creatures..$$Thanks George!  Very useful information.  What do you do?$$I was going to say that the native dog of Korea, the Sapsalgae, is a dog found in the south-eastern part of the Korean Peninsula. It has been designated a natural monument in Gyeongsan which is the neighbouring county of Gyeongju. . These dogs have been bred exclusively as house dogs; their 'work' spiritual rather than physical. Traditionally, these dogs were believed to dispel ghosts and evil spirits and even misfortune
But then the dogs in the picture don‚Äôt look anything like the Sapsalgae nor the Chinese spitz. Just a wild guess.
$$Can you tell me the name of the temple? My hometown is 20 min away from Gyeongju and I went there like once a week, but I never see that... $$By the way, we don't eat dogs. Perhaps a small amount of people might consider it as a delicacy.. it's sickening.. but don't tar everyone with the same brush.. And the British have pigs blood (Black puddings). 

A good intro:
The Korean Jindo Dog (Hangul: ÏßÑÎèóÍ∞ú; Hanja: ÁèçÂ≥∂Í∞ú) is a breed of a hunting dog  known to have originated on Jindo Island  in Korea. Although relatively unknown outside Korea, it is celebrated in its native land for its fierce loyalty and brave nature.$$The name of the temple is Í≥®Íµ¥ÏÇ¨ (Golgulsa), and this statue is located along the path before you reach the temple.$$Some good guesses here- I think to protect the temple is probably the best bet. but, just to add another theory: Could it be to remember the breeds that were made extinct during Japanese occupation?
Although Michael's comment was kind of rude, Kerry, I don't think you can say 'only a small amount' of Koreans eat dog meat- There are 4 
Î≥¥Ïã†ÌÉï restaurants in my neighborhood, and a number of my coworkers, students, and friends have tried or eat it once or twice a year...$$I agree, I think that Michael's comment is very rude. I also don't think that you can even generalize a ""small amount"" of anything. Some people eat dog but some Hispanics eat Guinea Pigs and some Mormons are polygamous... I personally don't feel that the comment made about dogs being delicious should be included without explanation- I feel like it's Mr. Doyle just trying to be funny and failing. 

But I think that the dog is super cute and that maybe it is a symbol of Chinese influence on Korea. Maybe it was constructed in the year of the dog?$$Perhaps A tribute the dish Kagogi (Kay-go-ghee). I was invited to a traditional wedding of one of the Korean Army compound commanders daughter while stationed there they had Kagogi.
 The South Korean dog meat industry reportedly involves about 1 million dogs, 6,000 restaurants, and 10 percent of the population.  In South Korea there is currently several laws in place that while the laws don't exactly make the sale of dog meat illegal they do make the method of euthanizing canines a lot more palatable and humane.
The chickens I saw in market were live. You chose the bird you wanted, they shoved a ice pick in the hart and put in a feather plucking machine and you took it home and cleaned it at home.
I did not ask the process of getting the meat for the Kagogi. Whether they carried it home in a bag or on a leash but I do know they usually only use dogs bread and raised for that purpose.
Now there is a vast difference in the way things are done in the country and big city's and the way they think and do things.
Yes they do eat Dog meat.$$it's a story of a dog, Haciko$$Ronald I think that is true in most countries that they do things differently in the city than they do in the country. No matter what level of ""civilization"" we reside in the country folk still tend to be old school on the techniques for most things.$$Hachiko is in Japan so Im wondering about this one in Korea..hmmmmmm...",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

""I saw your recent post regarding future Singapore MRT/LRT maps and thought I‚Äôd throw mine into the ring. The Singapore MRT has long been one of my fave metro systems around the world. 

I like the concept of destination numbers and station numbers - I believe it is one of the first, if not the first, to use this concept (do let me know if that‚Äôs not quite right).  

My approach for this map is to incorporate the station number into the station marker itself to avoid some of the clutter associated placing the station name AND the number alongside the station marker.  

Also, I really wanted the Circle Line to be a circle, so I have adopted a few distortions to make that happen. Finally, I tried to incorporate geography of Singapore in a stylistic manner to further reinforce the circle motif.

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn‚Äôt a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 ‚Äî known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It‚Äôs only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They‚Äôve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.
