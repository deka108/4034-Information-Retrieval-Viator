The best way to describe the Beatiful Destinations team is they represent a sector of travel that is very adventurous. They like to go where people have never been before. They like to look at familiar places from a very unfamiliar attitude. So what they're saying is, this is what is the most incredible experiences that they've had. Now the advantage of this is, because of their unique perspective, they're sending out images of the Philippines that even we have never seen before, at least from the perspective that they have. And that's a tremendous boost for us.Are you following Beautiful Destinations on Instagram and Facebook? You should be. They just visited the Philippines! Our chief correspondent Pia Hontiveros speaks to the Beautiful Destinations team and to Tourism Secretary Mon Jimenez.","good move for our Tourism agency. :)$$It's great that so many more people are appreciating the Philippines I only hope that the boom does not damage / destroy the natural beauty.$$Good job Sec Jimenez!!

The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) is the premiere showcase of the arts in the country. Founded in 1969 under the Marcos regime, it still continues to hold the most celebrated and award-winning plays from around the world. At night, it's therapeutic to watch the fountain lightshow — a colorful oasis by the side of the main road, in the middle of a busy metro.

Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

The people whose lives and livelihood are now dependent on this growing industry in the Philippines called tourism.

Our first story is from @vin_aranas87 (on Instagram) who traveled in May 2015 to Itbayat, #Batanes, the northernmost inhabited island of the Philippines. There, he met their tour guide, Kuya Pepe.

""We met Kuya Pepe on our second day and discussed with him our plans of reaching the #RafangCliffs on the eastern side of #Itbayat. Getting to this place needs some great deal of advice from him as he was the only person allowed to pass through private properties leading to Rafang Cliffs.

""Although he was Marine Engineer by profession, Kuya Pepe chose to stay in the island to be with his family and make a living out of tour-guiding. He explained that being a tour guide has helped him with much of their expenses; he was able to send his kids to school until they finished their studies.

""But aside from the fulfillment he gives his family, he also finds personal joy whenever he sees people enjoying their visit to Itbayat.""

I hated SMRT breakdowns till I went to Australia and had to wait 1 hour for my bus because that's how often they came. When I was stuck in a jam in Bangkok for an hour, I decided getting off and walking would be faster.

Sure, it's very easy to complain about everything, but let's not be that angry Singaporean. Here are 8 facts that'll make you proud to call Singapore home.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/happy-facts-sgWe Singaporeans love complaining, but there are so many blessings we constantly take for granted. Here are 8 things all Singaporeans should be thankful for!","There's also the efficiency issue. My friend had to wait almost two weeks before his Internet got set up when he moved to Manchester. That sort of nonsense is unheard of here.$$should let S'porean feel to have no electricity for 2 consecutive days and water$$Some Singaporeans are just not thinking realistically, expecting everything in Sg to be perfect...including our standard of governance.  Would we be here talking about these things if they are so lousy?. They may not be perfect but to be fair, aren't that bad. Might I ask who else can do it better than them presently?
Many have travel and seen the world yet can't do a real comparison between us and other countries ....sad!$$Yes!
I told my mom when trapped inside mrt train last year... she thought i must be angry but i just told her better than when i was in Bangkok anyway, it was like hell over there. 3hrs trapped in mrt is better than living in terrible Bangkok!$$Probably im the only Singaporean that doesnt complain. Been to Malaysia and Indonesia, thank God im lucky to be born In Singapore ❤$$44 deg heat with no air con in an old car in australia...Singaporean need to experience this once in their lifetime and they'll never complain about traffic again! Lol$$All is so true Singapore is just spot on$$Try driving in Jakarta's rush hour :)$$Why compare with Bangkok when you can compare with Japan ? If you want to compare with bkk, why not other things like affordable housing, cars, pace and cost of living ? If you want to feel good about yourself why stop at bkk? Compare your life with Palestinian ones la!$$True, but if you want to compare the areas which other countries are worse off than Singapore, you also need to compare all the areas which other countries are better off than Singapore. It works both ways.$$30 minutes traffic is not bad. I love the public transportation in Singapore. Nothing compared here in Manila. Imagine going to work on Monday morning and going back home on tuesday early morning due to traffic and flood.$$Singapore's geographic area is also 1/10 of these places. Why not more specific comparisons to cities of similar size and GDP? Maybe Hongkong or Seoul? Albeit our transportation remains the top of the curve in comparison to most major cities in the world, it doesn't make a fair comparison simply in terms of land mass.$$We are still using ADSL mind you....one big difference between Sg and oz was the ""speed"" of the internet here. I reckon my grandpa could ran quicker than loading a page in Oz! Lolll$$Well, the next time a Singaporean minister embarrasses the nation by comparing other countries unfavourably to us, let's not jump on him or her then yeah?$$Sawadee Jao. We welcome you to come to Bangkok to see our jam. Singaporean very lucky. Jam in aircon bus, even must stand is still comfort. In Bangkok, jam in bus no aircon, and no place for sit, and bus start-stop-start-stop and very hot chiphai. 
Singapore also have very good data network when jam have Line for chat with friend. Bangkok data not fast same Singapore.

Why Singaporean complain I don't know. Why Singapore make so many road toll for make driver pay, so no jam, I also don't know. 

I think Singaporean all must come Bangkok visit see jam and experience.

Come, visit Bangkok. Spend your money in our Chatuchak so Thai economy can be boost same Singapore always every year improve. 
Come support our industry in the day time and the night time for Thailand take care you from when you wake up to when you sleeping and even when you sleeping we have way to take care you.$$Their cars are cheaper.

on my FB feed. Hope you are not yet at the stage where you need positive singapore facts! x$$Opportunity cost is higher in sg with such hectic lifestyle that we live in.$$The geographical , demographic and econmoics are ways too different to make comparison.$$We must learn to step out of our hermit shell and start to appreciate the things around us.$$Please tell 30% nuts in Singapore 🇸🇬!

It is therefore one of the four venues where the Kumbh Mela – said to the largest congregation of humanity anywhere in the world – is held once every 12 years.

It is located halfway through Panglao along its coast facing the Bohol Sea. It is a sprawling property which covers 16 hectares. The topography of the resort is diverse. It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

My craziest new year Resolution I never told anyone is to have 6 packs abs as a mum of 2 kids and to be the fittest mama ever! Sounds unrealistic because I have so much loose skin & cellulites all over my body but so much space in my heart to hold love from my kids ❤ but I believe as long as I can dream, I can achieve the impossible!$$My new year's resolution is to spend more time with my kids, explore new countries with them and prepare them for our new life ahead. I am a single mom raising two boys alone. 2017 will be the start of our new lives..

Liked and shared #startAFRESH$$My craziest new year resolution for 2017 is to finally be able to cycle confidentally. This might not seem crazy for others but it is for me. Went to ECP when i was 16 and something happened, something bad. Hoping to overcome my fear and be able to cycle with my mum as she is a avid cyclist :)$$""Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's Maybelline."" - #word really. I don't believe in being born with beauty; I guess you can be born with pretty good features (or not), but beautiful is really a long journey of working hard to refine oneself not just on the inside, but outside as well. 

This year, as I am going to be a 2017 bride, my craziest new year resolution would be to STAY OFF SWEET FOODS. Which is almost impossible because if you looked at my FB and Instagram, you'd know just how integral food is in my life. Not just for survival, nope, it's more than that. It's sustenance for my fun-loving soul 😂😂😂 But since I need to look good for my upcoming wedding and pre-wedding photoshoot, I have to cut down on desserts for good skin and some weight loss. So please be kind and support me in my journey - good makeup is always welcomed! 😉🎉💕 #startAfresh$$My craziest new year resolution is to finally pluck up the courage and determination to learn martial arts! This would open doors to so many new opportunities like travelling independently (safety!), being more active and healthy and finally, meeting new people in Uni! ✈️💪🏻👭👬👫 Will definitely be a tough one to follow through but I'm resolute that I can! And of course, looking fab when I'm not trying to kick ass will be awesome too!$$Craziest new year resolution is to be kinder and better to myself. I spend non working hours for my kids and with my kids, even when i am on leave its all for them , never for myself. This year i will be a bit selfish and create more time for myself, a leaner me, a fitter me and a healthier me!$$My craziest resolution is to do good and pay it forward at least once every month! Be it a kind deed, donate to charity and help someone in need! Got to be beautiful not just outside, but inside too right?

In this new year ,Craziest new year resolution will be time to be a proactive parent, spend more time with my son  and get rid of those bad habits that my child might pick up!$$My craziest new year's resolution is to KonMari or declutter my WHOLE HOME i have way too many clothes, beauty products, books, etc, i want to junk everything that i havent been using frequently and wake up to a new and minimalist home! Just in time for spring cleaning for CNY as well!$$I guess the craziest new year resolution for 2017 is to FINALLY start learning how to do make up after 22 years of life! I hate make-up for nuts after having done a photoshoot make-up cause everything felt so heavy on my skin and I could feel my pores suffocating! Especially since I'm stepping into the working society soon enough, I do want to look more presentable and time to pamper myself with good make-up products! 2017 shall be the year I #startAFRESH!$$My craziest new year resolution is to get my skincare regime clean and right! Always using skincare as and when hasn't help me facial appearance at all!

Liked and shared!$$My craziest new year resolution is to stop using handphone once im home. At 1st i said to myself start from 1/1, then i been giving myself reasons/excuses to start the next day lah huh... hmmm...$$My crazy resolution for the new year would be to get a driving license !! Attempting to get one at 25 might be a challenge as the brain might be rusty to studying and cramming the notes in my head 😂 So it is indeed a crazy idea to get myself out there on the roads but I believe I can do it !$$Liked! My craziest resolution would be traveling alone during my grad trip! Yes i know, it's totally normal but the crazy part is that I am going to just randomly book a flight and go on an impromtu adventure w/o planning :D$$Liked both pages!
My craziest new year resolution is to make an impact in people's lives. I would want to make a positive difference in society and how I intend to do that is to talk to everyone living in my block and bond. I want to know them better and to help them out in any way I could. #helpwhereeverican
I also intend to help out at the community centre as much as I can as well. Now that I have graduated from university, I will have more time on my hands to do so than before!$$My craziest new year resolution is to minimise my intake of the fattening CNY goodies like pineapple tarts, bak kwa, sugee cookies, love letters etc. etc. =P

Hence, my craziest new year resolution is to sort out the financial worry with taking up an MBA. I am considering the alternatives to the main causes of my financial stress and consider cutting up my credit cards, reducing my annual overseas vacation. Hopefully I will indirectly boost my own happiness and sense of achievement.#startAFRESH$$My craziest new year resolution will be to have a fruits and water detox for my meals for a month.

This is my invention I made a few days ago to fight the governments consistent gang stalking that never stops . The U.S. government use silent sound RF frequencies to hack into your brain and administer mind control threw Tv and radio by using radio frequencies . This is the combination of over 2 and a half years work and building things and frequencies that work and heal the mind and body . I was working with only sound up until a few days ago and now I have built a RF frequency silent sound negative RF protection modulator using the 4 separate sound devices and several frequencies I have compiled that work to shut them out and shut them down for good . I don't have much money and if I did I could build a proper sound silent sound modulator that could be un hackable .Due to lack of funds I am using my computer and that is the biggest down fall of this mechanism because they can hack and piggy back off the media players and distort the frequencies from being how they should be .This could easily be solved with a stereo tuner and multiple sound devices and a mixer . All these things I do not have .Also with a more powerful transmission device I could heal the planet in a matter of days . Even the radiation from FUKUSHIMA could be healed in a matter of weeks if not days . Rf frequencies effect you on a molecular level and could do the same for water if a powerful enough Rf modulator was built broadcasting the Binural frequency called Radiation detox . Now I know why the U.S. Government takes it down when I put it on line for people to use for free . This frequency kills radiation .This could also be used to kill infected plants and people and The Earth infected with Chem trails and GMO . I am sure of it so please spread the word and please help me in any way you can . Be blessed and walk in the light .

The Khajuraho temples were built in the short span of a hundred years, from 950-1050 AD in truly inspired burst of creativity. Of the 85 original temples, 22 have survived till today to constitute one of the world's great artistic wonders.

I love the Korea furniture museum  

Since years now i really like and i love deeply  to visit museums when travelling to new places. I think this is because museums tell me a lot about the culture of those places.
Museums are also fun. It’s almost impossible to get bored in a museum. Every museum will have at least one thing of interest to somebody.When visiting someplace new, you can find out about the culture of that place in many ways. You can go to a movie or a place of worship or a nightclub. Another option is to sit in the park and listen to the people around you. The easiest way to learn about a place’s culture, though, is by visiting its museums. Museums will show you the history of the place you’re visiting. They’ll show you what art the locals think is important.
Museums are also fun. Even if you’re not interested in art or history, there is always something to get your attention. Many museums now have what they call “hands-on” exhibits. These were originally designed to keep children occupied while their parents were looking at exhibits. However, museums have found that adults enjoy hands-on opportunities just as much as children. These exhibits have activities like pushing a button to hear more about what you’re looking at, creating your own work of art, or trying on clothes like those on the models in the museum.
People also enjoy visiting museums about unusual subjects. For instance, in my hometown there’s a museum devoted to the potato. This museum has art made out of potatoes. It also tells all about the history of the potato, and sells potato mementos like key chains and potato dolls.
People enjoy visiting this museum because it’s different. It’s not something they’d find in their hometown and the museum’s curator enjoys talking about the Great Potato. Museums are popular because they are about us. They reflect our creations, our values, and our dreams. No matter who you are or what you like, somewhere there is a museum that will amaze and interest you.

Why do you think they made a statue of a dog? ","That is a good theory!  Do you have a dog statue in your backyard Tina?  hehe  I should have one... my dear puppy passed away last year.  

Marie$$aww I'm sorry to hear that....don't have a backyard yet but I really couldn't tell you why they have a statue of a dog....might be significant in some way but dogs are always loyal creatures..$$Thanks George!  Very useful information.  What do you do?$$I was going to say that the native dog of Korea, the Sapsalgae, is a dog found in the south-eastern part of the Korean Peninsula. It has been designated a natural monument in Gyeongsan which is the neighbouring county of Gyeongju. . These dogs have been bred exclusively as house dogs; their 'work' spiritual rather than physical. Traditionally, these dogs were believed to dispel ghosts and evil spirits and even misfortune
But then the dogs in the picture don’t look anything like the Sapsalgae nor the Chinese spitz. Just a wild guess.
$$Can you tell me the name of the temple? My hometown is 20 min away from Gyeongju and I went there like once a week, but I never see that... $$By the way, we don't eat dogs. Perhaps a small amount of people might consider it as a delicacy.. it's sickening.. but don't tar everyone with the same brush.. And the British have pigs blood (Black puddings). 

A good intro:
The Korean Jindo Dog (Hangul: 진돗개; Hanja: 珍島개) is a breed of a hunting dog  known to have originated on Jindo Island  in Korea. Although relatively unknown outside Korea, it is celebrated in its native land for its fierce loyalty and brave nature.$$The name of the temple is 골굴사 (Golgulsa), and this statue is located along the path before you reach the temple.$$Some good guesses here- I think to protect the temple is probably the best bet. but, just to add another theory: Could it be to remember the breeds that were made extinct during Japanese occupation?
Although Michael's comment was kind of rude, Kerry, I don't think you can say 'only a small amount' of Koreans eat dog meat- There are 4 
보신탕 restaurants in my neighborhood, and a number of my coworkers, students, and friends have tried or eat it once or twice a year...$$I agree, I think that Michael's comment is very rude. I also don't think that you can even generalize a ""small amount"" of anything. Some people eat dog but some Hispanics eat Guinea Pigs and some Mormons are polygamous... I personally don't feel that the comment made about dogs being delicious should be included without explanation- I feel like it's Mr. Doyle just trying to be funny and failing. 

But I think that the dog is super cute and that maybe it is a symbol of Chinese influence on Korea. Maybe it was constructed in the year of the dog?$$Perhaps A tribute the dish Kagogi (Kay-go-ghee). I was invited to a traditional wedding of one of the Korean Army compound commanders daughter while stationed there they had Kagogi.
 The South Korean dog meat industry reportedly involves about 1 million dogs, 6,000 restaurants, and 10 percent of the population.  In South Korea there is currently several laws in place that while the laws don't exactly make the sale of dog meat illegal they do make the method of euthanizing canines a lot more palatable and humane.
The chickens I saw in market were live. You chose the bird you wanted, they shoved a ice pick in the hart and put in a feather plucking machine and you took it home and cleaned it at home.
I did not ask the process of getting the meat for the Kagogi. Whether they carried it home in a bag or on a leash but I do know they usually only use dogs bread and raised for that purpose.
Now there is a vast difference in the way things are done in the country and big city's and the way they think and do things.
Yes they do eat Dog meat.$$it's a story of a dog, Haciko$$Ronald I think that is true in most countries that they do things differently in the city than they do in the country. No matter what level of ""civilization"" we reside in the country folk still tend to be old school on the techniques for most things.$$Hachiko is in Japan so Im wondering about this one in Korea..hmmmmmm...",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The Indonesian government has given a free visa for 90 countries. #WonderfulIndonesia ","as Indonesian, i am ashame that the guy who made this picture didn't know that Czechoslovakia has disappeared since 1992 and the government of Indonesia gives an extended visa free to a defunct non-existent country. Come on Indonesia...$$I hope its vice versa for indonesian passport holder to visit those countries tho :D$$So the truth about the visa free entry,is that like most things jokowi has tried to do, the corrupt embedded systems have found away around it.  

The way corrupt immigration officials have managed to get around this one are:
1)reducing the 90 free visa (as it is in most of asean)  to 30 days then with a intrusive,  unfriendly,  nasty and corrupt extension possible at immigration offices. 
2)not providing it to the largest incoming tourist group in Bali, Australians,  because a) corrupt officials at the airport are so dependant on that cash coming in.  These are the same government officials who always guarantee there are not enough immigration officers working at anyone time at the Bali airport so that they can offer a discrete express service foe an extra  cash fee and b) just to childishly spite Australia, claiming it is because Australia does not reciprocate with free visa for Indonesians,  conveniently over looking that many many of the 90 countries on the list also don't offer free visas to Indonesians. 
3)only making it available at a few very specific ports of entry,  Jakarta,  Batam, Bali and maybe one or two others,  but yogya for example misses out, which is why some have written that they still had to pay.

So are you ready?  You have 24 hours starting NOW!!! ","My favorite place in Korea has to be Seoul. The real story of Seoul is not hidden in the tall skyscrapers or the ancient temples that encircle the urban center, but in a few important landmarks that are both historically significant and symbolic at the same time. Take Jongno street for instance. Better known as the ""Bell Street,"" Jogno is famous for Bosingak, which is a marquee with a large bell. It is said the bell signals different times of a day and controls the four main gates to the city. The bell is usually rung thirty-three times at the midnight on New Year's Eve. However, when former president Kim Dae-jung took office in 1998, the bell was rung in the midst of an intense economic crisis that had hit the country. Every Korean worth his salt knows that Kim opened a new chapter of economic transparency and played an even greater role of steering the country on the world map by hosting international events such as the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The melancholic yet inspiring sound of the bell has definitely struck a chord with millions of locals and expats living in or across Seoul, just like me :)$$My favourite place is Incheon Airport.  It's a bitter-sweet feeling for me everytime I was there, the excitement when arriving and the sad feeling when departing...all beyond words.  The airport is always sparkling clean and alive, always welcoming to visitors and have good food and shopping to spend time before heading to the gate.  Best place to catch sun sets and to spot Rain. : )$$My favourite place in Korea is in Seoraksan National Park. At the peak of Daechongbong you can escape the hustle bustle of the city and get the ultimate view of the true beauty Korea has to offer. It’s a grueling climb to the top, but once there the scenery is breathtaking. You can see for miles on a clear day and bask in the peace at the top of the mountain. For me, Korea is largely about the mountains, and there is no better place to experience this.$$While we're on a food theme, it has to be Jeollado.  While I'd heard the food was going to be good (and it was), I'd also been led to expect the people to be a bit cold or tough.  Instead, I had some of my most memorable experiences on the road as people shared parts of their lives with me that I never expected.  In between that, I travelled deserted beaches on the south coast, walked through tea fields, dozed on a pagoda with a praying mantis in perhaps the prettiest temple I'd seen and cruised around glass-like seas.  And, of course, I ate.  A lot, well, and unusually, all prepared to an amazingly high standard (in a country that already had impressed me with the quality and care in its food).

Oh, and I highly recommend the goat.$$Call me a sentimental old fool, but it will have to be the old world charm of Andong for me. Even Queen Elizabeth II spent her birthday in Andong with a little celebration at the Soju Museum. Andong is the center of culture and folk traditions, noted for its serene beauty. I love history and Andong is steeped in it, right from the Three Kingdoms Period of Silla, Goguryeo and Baekje right up to the Joseon Dynasty. At the core of Andong’s long and illustrious past were numerous distinguished scholars, aristocrats and noblemen. It has the reputation of being the best preserved ancient metropolitan city. You can still find many of the homes of the noble class in Andong today. It used to be the centre for Confucianism at one point in Korean history. I may not be a follower of Confucianism but I respect some of their beliefs like justice and good manners are the key factors in life and I also admire their filial piety towards their elders.
Though the die-hard Confucians are not around anymore, Andong is one of the few places in the world where Confucian practices are still directly being passed down to its descendants to this day, as well as being a centre of education. Its current inhabitants are the direct descendants of those who actually occupied the houses in the Joseon Dynasty era. Because of its highly historical value, the village itself is often being referred to as a ‘roofless museum’.
I would like to go to Andong to enjoy a stay in the traditional hanok guest houses available throughout the area. The Hahoe Village, Jirye Art Village, Jeonju Ryussi-musiljongtaek (Ryu noble family’s estate), I understand, are great places to experience a unique lodging experience and to sample the true essence of Korea’s traditional lifestyles. I just love traditional old houses and seowons and Andong is a treasure trove filled with them. The Andong Hahoe Folk Village which was designated Important Folk Material #122 is now up for nomination to become a World Heritage Site in 2010. Hahoe is especially known for its mask dances. The Dosan Confucian Academy, the Byeongsan Seowon Academy, 
Jirye Art Village, Andong Folk Museum, Goseong Lee head family Estate, Imcheonggak Pavillion, Ocheon Relics Site(village), the Hahoe Mask Museum and a 600-year-old zelkova tree in the Samshin-dang area are what I want to see in Andong. 

Perhaps my exposure to Korean movies/dramas set in the Joseon era, like Untold Scandal, Daejanggeum, Hwang Jini, Damo and Painter of the Wind have  contributed to my obsession of Andong.

I must not forget to mention the authentic Andong food that I want to try like heotjesatbap (this dish originates from the custom of using vegetables, meat, and seafood dishes left from memorial services) that includes Andong-style bibimbap.
Andong specialty that is sometimes included in the heot jesa bap is gan godeung-eo, or super, super salty mackerel. Some other Andong dishes include Andong Jjimdak, Andong Sikhye and Geonjin Guksu.
$$I have 3 favorite places in Korea: the Gyeongbokgung Palace, including Changdeokgung Palace (Rear Garden included), Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksucgung Palace, and Joncgmyo Shrine. I'd like to stay at the ""Secret Garden"" that was intended for the King. I find peace and serenity while walking inside the palace grounds. The other place is the Korean Village. I want to live in the traditional 'Hanok"" house and experience korean living. Lastly, Myeongdong, particularly, the Myeongdong Cathedral (Catholic Church).  Solemnity and solace in this place, is a sanctuary for me.$$@George Romeiser Hogan: thank you for those beautiful words as you describe Korea in your heart. You are right in every detail. You are both lucky to find each other in such a wonderful place like Korea. Perhaps, the one place I will always remember is that small korean restaurant (adjacent to Siloam Hospital) where I ate chajangmyeon with someone I was beginning to ""like""... but who left me in the end...

What is it like? 
Schooling is when a group of fish swim together in one direction. They do this to fend off predators by creating a ""confusion effect,"" where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

Fun Fact: 
Shoaling is different from schooling. Shoaling is when a group of fish is grouped closed together, but each one is swimming independently. . Tubbataha has 600 species of fish that either school or shoal.

Beautiful kalanggaman island$$I propose to the first stage of the restoration of the rivers of the Republic of the Philippines. Take the work of any mountain of 300 meters and above.
Towards the large flows of water from the mountain, at an altitude of, say, 1,000 meters, set concrete or plastic tubs, for example, 10 pieces of 10 meters in height. We got an inclined ladder. Accumulate in the tenth of a bath, the water is poured into the ninth, and so on, until the first bath.
From the first bath tubes protrude, and the water falls directly to the foot of the mountain where dug pond storage of chilled water.
So, what happened:
Crystal clear, enriched with all kinds of trace elements, accumulated in the bath at a height of 1000 meters. Her temperature is 6.7 degrees lower than at the foot of a law lowering the temperature due to the increase in height. The same temperature and ponds.
Hence, when applying several staircase, cool water of the river, roughly: the river basin area is multiplied by 6.7, divide by 100 and get no volatility, that is, the moisture remaining in the river
The results:
First. The lake is an accumulation of clear water, where you can drink for children and pregnant women, and surplus to sell and earn income.
Second. Chilled water from the lake gradually cools the water in the river, percolates down and cools the water in the surface and underground waters. Cooling reduces the volatility of all types of water resources, the accumulation of water and improve its quality due to dilution.
The third. Accumulation of water in rivers, reservoirs above and below ground, the increase of productive land, pastures and forests. And the creation of new jobs.
And a fourth. Received a standing simple actions and penny cost technology that will work without consuming any energy resources to 1,000 years - the life of concrete or plastic in an inactive environment.
Other parameters:
The falling water to turn the turbines can, and to provide electricity to farmers.
My technique, unlike the desalination and purification, which consume electricity like a monster, 365 days a year, of energy resources not consume.
Desalination and purification of the same 365 days a year emit hot air, that the warming will not be tolerated at all. My technology is no air emissions do not produce.
Permanent staff do not require.
Cheaper any human to 3-5.
Not so, but such technologies are available dozens of cubic kilometers of water, and to capitalize on this in the Amazon and the rivers of Africa to 0.3 trillion on.

We had an awesome trip - exploring the lower part of Belum where we trekked up the slippery ground in search of the famous rafflesia, an eye-opening visit to the  aborigines village where life is very simple and basic and time seems to stand still, and a tiring but rewarding trek up to Sungai Enam Base Camp where we had a refreshing dip in the cool waterfall. 

We were there for 5 days, exploring the Banding trail, belum rainforest, the nearby town of Gerik (we had lovely chats with the friendly locals and I got to try the ikan pekasam which I like so much) and even managed a day trip to Betong, Thailand through the Pengkalan Hulu border. I must say that our trip to Belum was very exciting and adventurous for us. We even enjoyed the long road trip (we drove abt 10 hrs all the way from S'pore to Banding), taking in the lovely sights of the natural landscape that 'paints' the state of Perak.$$The 40,000-hectare Matang Mangrove Forest in Kuala Sepetang. Today, it is recognized as the best managed sustainable mangrove ecosystem in the world. Lots of interesting activities can be done, such as strolling on wooden boardwalk, replanting of saplings, studying numerous ways of fishing, bird watching, and much more!$$Had a blast of a time wid my family at Pangkor last June.Although a bit quiet, we had the pool at Anjungan Resort almost to ourselves.Saw lots of  the famous hornbills of Pangkor n done our dried seafood shopping galore.We love the tranquillity n peace of the island :-)$$I just came back from Jalan Bukit Merah Laketown Resort at Perak with my family.

As part of the celebrations under the #VisitPhilippinesAGAIN2016 campaign, the Philippine Department of Tourism in the United Kingdom launched ""The Station Domination Series"" in one of London's busiest train stations, the Waterloo Rail Station.

Starting last 24 April 2016, the first ""Station Domination Series"" features a special immersion zone that gives commuters a feel of the Philippines' beauty and promise of an overall fun experience when they travel to the Philippines. The launch also coincided with one of UK's most anticipated events, the London Marathon 2016.

The ""Station Domination Series"" also gives commuters a chance to win instant prizes and a holiday to the Philippines in three fun ways. One is by taking “foot selfies” using our floor stickers mapped around the station concourse, second is by taking part in the 3D selfie stand, and third is by experiencing the Philippine islands through a 360 virtual reality pods with photos by photographer Rommel C. Bundalian. 

Apart from the experiential zone, the campaign also features a month-long Philippine branding presence on Europe's largest LED screen found also at the Waterloo Station.

This activation campaign will run until 23 May 2016! Got friends and relatives in the UK? Tag them now! ","This is a fantastic idea!

http://www.positivelyfilipino.com/magazine/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-kapampangansHow best to understand the natives of Pampanga Province.","I lived and worked in Angeles, San Fernando and Dau near the bus terminal last 2010 working as part of the marketing team of a Makati hotel trying to capture the kapampangan market. This blog has probably captured the true description of this culinary center yet often misunderstood people& province. I only got to taste authentic homegrown kapampangan cooking when I got invited to a wedding in a barrio in Arayat. It was lavish for a barrio wedding with everyone helping in. And all the foods were truly the famous cabalen home cooking I've been hearing of. I specially liked the sweet adobo meat & when they told me it's a dog, I turned my eyes on the duck, prawn and pork menus.haha. We dipped in the cold springs of Mt.Arayat. For me, that wedding was the focal point of my Pampanga sojourn.$$Yes, it is very true that
""Kapampangans are deeply religious which, of course, is not the same as spiritual. Their fetish for anitos (spirit idols) has morphed into an excessive, almost irrational, devotion to anything associated with their colonizers’ religion. Kapampangans have found their new idols on which to lavish their affections: the church temple for which they’d spend any amount to build, rebuild and renovate; the retablos and santos (altars and icons) which they over-decorate, over-dress, and over-process; and of course their priests whom they over-revere to the point of electing one as governor.""

The many details enumerated above made Bro Eli Soriano, who is not a Kapampangan, stay in this province and dare to focus his efforts to preach the Biblical Gospel of Christ, even if the teachings of our Lord and Saviour that he trumpets are often the exact opposite to the idolatrous Catholic teachings given to the local populace.

The ADD Convention Center was later built in Apalit to continue the banner television and radio program named Ang Dating Daan, and with the mercy and grace of God, thousands of Kapampangans have left the catholic faith and joined the 100% Bible-based Church of God.

Coimbatore, an ancient city, was the capital of a small tribal village, Kongunad, before the 2nd century AD until it was brought under Chola control in the 2nd-3rd centuries AD by Karikalan, the first of the early Cholas. 

Among its other great rulers were the Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas, Pandyas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara kings. When Kongunad fell to the British along with the rest of the state, its name was changed to Coimbatore. 

Today, Coimbatore (Kovai in Tamil) is a commercial city of considerable importance; it is home to over 60 spinning and weaving mills and textiles is its main industry. It is also well known for motor sports with regular events being held at the Kari Motor Speedway.

Celebrations are carried out on November 15th or the month of November for boys who reach the age of 3 or 5, or for girls who turn 3 or 7 years old. The custom is for the children to dress in their best clothes and to carry “Chitose-ame” which are long thin candy sticks colored in red and white, believed to bring good luck.

For 5 years I am an active user of SONY VAIO LAPTOP and SONY PLAYSTATION and very satisfied with the SONY products. For 6 years I use mobile phones from Apple and that what I have to complain about, that happened to me in these 6 years with any of my Apple products.
Through the media, my attention was drawn slowly but surely on the SONY deals on smart phones and was on November 22, 2014, I became a member of the Sony family, because I bought the Sony Xperia Z3 COMPACT (IMEI 355179065283809). First of all I was annoyed that I had not sooner worried me the phone because I loved the design, battery life and until I broke the glass of the back in my pocket by the software about two weeks ago and I injured my finger , Although I have understanding that it may be different in reality than promised in the ads, but that the back so fragmented, although it has come to a pointed object, surprised me very much.
I brought the phone to the competent charging and not surprised that I did not meet the warranty conditions and had to pay 90 TL for changing the glass back. Finally I sat down on it. It has lasted two weeks until I got the phone.
I realized immediately that the Proxmity sensor was not working and was told by the service that the Geraet was incorrectly installed and repaired it. After all the trouble I used the mobile phone full of joy and bought an expensive protective cover to protect it from further unexpected accidents.
But the blow came faster than expected and has brought the camel's back. Last night as I wanted to put me into the car, the phone fell out of my pocket on the ground, there was a height of 30 cm. The glass of the front and the back broke, even though it was in the case is a thousand pieces. I can not afford absolutely no understanding that the phone after a fall of 30 cm can come into this state. None of my friends can not believe it that the phone came with a simple fall into this state.
I'm really disappointed in Sony because they have such bad use or sensitive material, without considering that there is some device (finally a '' MOBILE '') which should withstand some shock or mishaps. For me it's just firmly around held between two panes of glass with fine black-cheap plastic thing that simply join in anything. Frankly, I'm disappointed in myself that I have the Sony familiar advertising and have too little research on the user comments had experienced in the hundreds same.
I can not understand that Sony has chosen as a marketing strategy that finally we have no complaints million per country, only a few hundred. I also do not see that it enters the warranty conditions, although the choice of the material just heard of being attributed to producers and for which the user is not enough information has been advised of the sensibility of the glass.
I should point out that I will do everything possible to make my consumer protection claims and as long as this publicly manifest until I get my right because SONY  Turkey does not take any action and they do not give my money back or change my phone!!! Please help me about this problem as you do to your customers in the United States Of America and United Kingdom and Japan.

Women are roses raised on different soils,
Their color may vary from place to place,
but their roles are permanently synonymous to the word Importance,
Their beauty transcends universe boundaries,
They can charm us both on pageantry and admire them in warfare,
They are our nectar in paradise and may turn to venom if abused.
They are our mothers who swing our future leaders & heroes hammock,
On our young age, They are our first trainers for us to become future workforce of the world.
They are our wives that warm our home with their love,
They are our sisters in playground and nurse that medicate our wounds in battlefield we chose,
They are our daughters who bring smile to our dolorous exhausted soul,
They are our doting grandma that console us candies and toys in our tantrum.
They are friends in armor when perturbation make our mind consumed,
They are the symbol of blindfolded justice, of liberty, of affection...
Lady Luck is their name sake, their lovely eyes are replete of vision.
They are light of the house that brings hope to the hopeless...
They are the symbol of motherland of every nation in this world...
Women are roses that can tame a gun with its scent,
They can tone down heated conflict by the  wisdom of their verses.
Their thorns will draw blood once it pricks be it by pauper or conqueror's hand,
Women are conduit of Life to infants who feed on their bosoms.
Miracles of Life starts from their womb,
Their Delicate petals can both kiss the morning dew and the scorching sun,
Their non-existence is humankind decimation,
They are consoling flowers for our natal,  betrothal, nuptial, until the funeral.
In both victory and defeat their buds soothes our senses,
Because They are Roses in all of our Life's occasion,
Roses that melt hearts and touches soul by mere sight & redolence.                                                                                                                  Women are sent by God to be of equal importance of Men...

Go to Hong Kong and enjoy! =)$$Jan-Feb would be the best time for me and my family to go..thanks so much!!!$$December 2 Jan is our vacation for fun to hong kong$$A letter from a teenage Filipino to the WHOLE WORLD (CNN) has already been translated into Chinese by Yeeyan

As you are reading this letter, I bet that you have seen/heard about what happened earlier in our country.

Tourists were hostages of a policeman here, Rolando Mendoza. After a few hours of the horrible crime, some of the victims were dead including the hostage-taker.

I wrote this letter not just to apologize but also to let everyone know that we Filipinos are not all like Mendoza. We are loving and good-hearted people.

For so many years, our country has been standing tall and surpassing every dilemma; be it small or big. Years ago (back when I wasn’t born yet), you have watched us fight for what we think is right. We fought for the democracy of our nation.. The EDSA revolution. But that’s just one out of many.

Second. We Filipinos have been serving other countries for our families and we treat you as our own as well. With all due respect, I thank you all for giving us the trust through the years. For helping us to become what we are now.

The Philippines is more than just a group of islands. We are a nation of strong and remarkable people. A country of beauty and love known to be hospitable and well-valued. I humbly apologize for what happened tonight. No one in this world would want something like that to happen for life should be valued.

I politely ask the attention of the world. Please do not judge and mistreat us just because of what happened tonight. I have been searching the net and found terrible things. Hong Kong advices to avoid travels here, China and HK bans Filipinos and that Philippines is the worst place to go.

I can’t blame you for what you have decided but I hope that you could understand. Our country is now in a sea of problems. And I know for sure that we helped you in a way or another. Let peace and understanding reign this time.

I know that this letter will just be trash but I wish that you would understand. On behalf of the Philippine population.. WE ARE SORRY.$$FOR FREE !! to those from Hong Kong and Macao ! from now u can apply entry permit ""from the internet"" and then print it down, dispensing with NT 300, the period of validity of this entry permit application is three months long, and u can use it once for one month long staying Taiwan !

What is it?
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact:
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Oh and this can be a great birthday present for you! 😙$$This Valentine's Day I will be flying off as it is part of my job. :( although we will be miles, even time zones apart, we will definitely Skype each other and celebrate Valentine's. It doesn't always need to be a grand occasion. As long as i get to see him or be with him, I'm happy. He's a best friend I can't live without and he pulled me through my darkest times. I love him always.$$When the clock strikes 12 tonight (16/01/16), it'd mean yet another milestone in our relationship - a decade. Happy 10th anniversary my love Min Yi Chua! Thank you for being the best boyfriend I can ever wish for, and also my best friend at the same time, for the past 10 years. (Yes, we are childhood lovers since secondary school😄)
I won't say our relationship is a smooth-sailing one, but I am glad we've survived a decade! Cheers to more decades to come! This coming vday will be our 10th vday tgt. It's definitely sth worth celebrating as this day didn't come easy. However, we aren't planning to go fancy restaurant or what not as we're saving up for our wedding day on 16/10/16. Rather, it'd be more of a simple twosome time at my house where I will cook his favourite dishes. Everyday is like vday when I'm with him <3
Hope to get this bracelet to mark this special day for us :)$$Koon Lim this valentine day will be such a special one because i m expecting our baby nuumber 1 and   we get to celebrate with little boy in my tummy  . This year we wont be able to book any restaurant because i know you know my cravings are different all times so on that day we will be like usual couple , dating and shopping for baby stuff and also waiting for the unusual cravings on that day and dine in any restaurant or hawker when food craving hit. What's more we dont celebrate our love just on valentine day . We celebrate almost everyday even when we fight. our love sparks even when conflicts start . And yes other than dating and eating and shopping, we also plan to have a heart to heart session at the beach when we can enjoy the breeze and also the night views !  Hope to take this opportunity to win and surprise 😆$$During Valentine's day, I would like to do something meaningful with my boyfriend by doing volunteer work to visit those that is less fortunate and spread the love to them. Everyday is a special day as long as i can spend time with him, we do not need to show our love to each other more especially on days like Valentine's day because we love each other so much that we do not know what is loving more. So we decide to share our over-flowing love by helping those that are less fortunate. As much as i want to ask my boyfriend to participate this contest with me to increase the chance of winning, but i decided not to in order to surprise him if i win the contest by sharing our love experience.$$Zhi Wei Lim this valentine's day I'll be the slave driver and ordering you to run errands (which I have not thought of) for our wedding in March 😂😂$$Well, my BF, currently my husband will be my travel mate this coming Valentine's day as we are going away for our honeymoon in Europe!

Haven't been spending much time ever since long distance started for us, so this is a chance to spend a lot of time tgt!$$Thie valentine i plan to bring my wife out for a walk and a day of dating. no fancy restaurant being booked at the moment because her strange cravings change everyday so i wont know what will she want to eat on that day . So we will be shopping till she hungry and bring her to eat whatever food she is craving for. and of course not to make her too tiring on her feet as she is pregnant , I will bring her to watch movie to relax her back as well as her feet. To us everyday is valentine day so on this day it wont be that special because in my heart she already taken the special place which words can't describe !$$Maybe snuggle and have a heart-to-talk chat. We're comfortable just like that. Or maybe cook / bake together. I'll be the helper, like usual, and he'll be my personal chef. But even doing nothing is fine. I just want to spend it with him. I want to stay by his side. Always.$$Just be like what we've been for the past 13 years. Or is it 12 years? We've never done couple bracelets before and we don't like couple outfits.

This Chiang Mai baby elephant has a habit of tumbling into helpless tourists and demanding to be snuggled.

A series of cuddling videos featuring little elephant “Nampuu” (or “Fountain”) were posted on Instagram by happy visitors who encountered the playful baby boy in the past month.

Nampuu lives at Patara Elephant Farm in Chiang Mai and is the star attraction of the “Elephant Owner for a Day” package tour designed to let people learn how to take care of elephants. On the tour, they learn about elephant temperament, health, bathing and how to communicate with the pachyderms.

What is it like? 
Since 1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. The most recent large eruption was on this day back in 1965.  Although considered active, this small volcano has been quiet over the last few decades. As a matter of fact, now there are hiking tours and overnight camping packages on offer.

Fun Fact: 
Want to know what it's like to swim inside a volcano? You can in Crater Lake. It's said that the high sulfuric content has medicinal properties. Some people have even scuba dived here. But don't stay too long. The lake's water also has high concentrations of boron, magnesium, aluminum and sodium in salt form.

I love everything about Korea such as Korean drama (I also have some favorite actors & actresses) their foods (kimchi, jjangmeyeon, ramen, etc), their lifestyle, their technology, their songs, their traditional cloths ""Hanbok"", I even wanna try to stay in their traditional house ""Hanok"".

I will shop non-stop n eat all day ;) The weather is perfect all year, be it skiing, mountain climbing, cycling or sightseeing! Korea's transportation is first class and cost of living is affordable. Security is good too. It's seems that I am not tired of visit South Korea even though I have visited twice previously.

Splendid country with great culture, scenery, nature and people.$$I want to travel to Korea because I love Korea: the culture, food, dramas, songs, people, lifestyle, everything!!!$$I grew up with Korean friends and their Umma's fed me an abundance of Korean food growing up like 김밥, 김치, 라면 & 불고기 (My appetite is practically Korean), I've watched K-dramas growing up that were dubbed in Tagalog when I lived in the Philippines for 6 yrs. My friend's mothers always spoke about their culture and their homeland  and thought me some Korean and how to read & write a bit so much that since I was a wee little girl, Korea has always been on my top places to go visit. It would be nice to actually step foot in Korea and enjoy it myself. Food (street food & royal cuisine), See the palaces, sightsee, shopping (I love Korean skin care too) & Oppa 송중기 would be a dream come true but what I would cherish the most out of this trip would be to fully immerse myself in the culture, scenery and community in Korea and experience the beauty of the homeland of what the gracious Ummas talked about all these years. Hopefully I get that opportunity! 감사합니다! 😊$$Hi! I'm learning many things of that wonderful country (language, gastronomy, history, etc.) and it would be great to see in person the amazing things that South  Korea has! I really hope to be there one day 😍$$I'd like to go to Korea to enjoy the warm hospitality and kindheartedness of Korean people.$$Done! ~ Thank you KTO/Imagine Your Korea for this new online event. :-)$$I really want to go to Korea. The reason is because of Korea is a beautiful country. Of people its a fun and many great places to visit. I also enthusiasts music and Korean drama. it is a pride if I met one of the Idol Korea. In addition, I really want to school in Korea. Of the first, I was trying so that I can to Korea. But there is always a hitch. Hopefully, with this I can go to Korea.$$Never thought that I'd fall in love with korean dramas 'til I watched one of it two years ago. And I love it ever since. Watching the dramas led me to the famous Running Man. I always try my best not to miss any single episode. Lee kwang soo is my favorite. Since he is a best friend to song joong ki, he is my favorite as well. These are enough to make me dream that visiting korea one day would be amazing thing to happen in my life. Not only to witness its beauty but travel with joong ki is another fortune.$$Hello everyone! I badly want to go to korea eversince I'm 14. I studied well and because we had a problem about financial needs i only attended a vocational course. Fortunately, i've graduated. But that's not enough cos i'm always rejected whenever i applied for work(they want college level) My plan is to save money so i can go to my dreamland, korea. But i think it will never happen cos i'm completely broke and if ever i had money, i gave them all to my family. I badly want to go to korea because korean's tradition and cultures always amuses me. Their music, their foods, their mannerism, the way koreans talk. All! Always amazes me. Someday, i want to live in korea for good. But for now, if i will be picked in this trip to korea, i will be the Happiest girl in the world and it will give me more inspiration to my dream to live in korea. I cried once cos i'm making myself woke up in reality that i have no luck and will never have a chance to go there. I really really love that country so bad!

NEVER go to the the capital city of Manila. The moment you arrive at the airport, you'll get hussled for money. Once you are outside of the airport, there's a big chance you'll get mugged, conned, stabbed or picked. Theres not much infrastructure for public services, there's extreme poverty in every corner. There's the worst traffic on earth, the worst pollution, the rubbish are strewn everywhere. Beaches are no longer prestine and there are too many people hassling you for money. The police are next to useless, the gov't is unstable, there are protests on a daily basis. There is nothing to see apart from old remnants of past colonizers. Prostitution and drugs are everywhere. The streets are flooded with illegal guns. There's the typhoon every month or every 3 weeks. There's the hot sticky muggy weather that is unbearable and just goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and lasts the whole year. And when your crappy holiday is over, you'll get squeezed out of your last peso at the airport. They have the airport terminal fee and something else.. also in cash! It must be paid in cash. Of course you can see that the cash disappears into thin air because the airport is so dilapidated that it earned the monicker: ""The worst airport in the world"" for 3 straight consecutive years!! So stay away.$$Just like in America ..., there are people with no food and shelter and  living under bridges or on the woods . Poverty is everywhere ..., not just in Philippines$$Dami nyo problema!

Inextricably linked with the history of Sikhism, Amritsar is amongst the most revered sites of the world. It was founded as recently as the 16th century. Its name is a derivative of the Amrit Sarovar (pool of nectar) amidst which stands the Golden Temple, the most sacred of Sikh shrines. Accounts suggest that Guru Amardas purchased the land from Emperor Akbar and decided to build a tank at the site. Following his death, it was completed by Guru Ramdas and also came to be known as Chak Ramdas or Guru ka Chak. Some of the oldest markets in Amritsar, notably Guru ka Bazaar, date back to his time. The construction of the Golden Temple was initiated by Guru Arjan Dev while Guru Hargobind, who accorded the religion a martial temper, built the Akal Takht in 1606. Amritsar has a rich history encompassing various mythical and historical narratives including the epic Ramayana. It is believed that the site called Ram Tirath was Maharish Valmiki’s ashram, where Sita reportedly gave birth to her twin sons, Luv and Kush. The Gobindgarh Fort and Ram Bagh were built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire. While the Jallianwala Bagh continues to be the most evocative monument to India’s freedom struggle. The Khalsa College, established by visionary leaders at the beginning of the 20th century turned Amritsar into a hub of education. Also a centre of thriving industry since its inception, Amritsar is famed for its textiles, particularly shawls, and for its carpets. Amritsar has gained tremendous popularity for its gourmet traditions; especially the dhabas (roadside eatery) that churn out, amongst an inexhaustible list of delicacies, irresistible kulchas, chola-bhaturas, tandoori chicken and fried fish. Amritsar has all the makings of a well-rounded tourist destination; its ancient legends, historical monuments, places of worship, old bazaars, theatre traditions and colourful festivals all serve as a window to its robust past. Excursions to the Harike Bird Sanctuary and visits to the India-Pakistan border at Wagah are an absolute delight, while breaking bread or celebrating Diwali with the denizens of this hospitable city is without parallel.(Courtesy Punjab Tourism) ","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwoKgR0ZwMI$$Just for my friends living in India:

http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattortile/27-filipinos-that-make-you-proud-to-be-pinoyWe're all just one giant extended family and a freaking awesome one at that.","Where the heck Is Eric Spoelstra?Whoever made this list doesn't like the Miami head coach or maybe a laker fan ;-)$$It would be nice if more of them were actually born in the Philippines or grew up in the Philippines$$And whomever made this list also doesn't like METALLICA. Kirk Hammett!!!!$$Arnel Pineda of Journey is not on the list?$$SHAME SHAME SHAME---really???  The 27 Filipinos who make you proud to be Pinoy are mostly US pop icons who don't even self-identify as Filipino???  That's not Pinoy pride, that's COLONIAL MENTALITY.$$Hi Lian. We respect your opinion regarding this list. We know that there are others equally deserving of this title. This post was meant to celebrate Filipino pride from all industries, regardless of whether the person was born/raised in the Philippines or not. Hope that clarifies things! :)$$The list itself doesn't bother me, but the title definitely does! One could so easily come up with a much better list of ""27 Filipinos who make you proud to be Pinoy""!!! Filipinos who actually consider themselves Filipino!!! (Admittedly, there are a few people on the current list who actually meet that criterria, thank goodness!).

The question of Philippine identity and colonial mentality is worth examining further. I find it ironic that #21 Jose Antoniio Vargas, is famous for launching the website and movement DEFINE AMERICAN, in which he argues that being American is not about your citizenship or legal status in the US, it is about whether you consider yourself an American, which he does. I respect his right to define his own identity, which makes it all the more ironic to find him listed here.

So the question is, how do you DEFINE FILIPINO? From this list, apparently, one doesn't have to even ever have been to the Philippines, speak the language, or in any way claim Philippine identity and culture as your own, it is sufficient to have a Philippine ancestor (no matter how distant) somewhere on your family tree?

I understand that the list is meant as a bit of fun, but the title warrants more serious examination.  No offense to anyone who is a fan of those on that list...

What is it like? 
Banaue is famous for the Ifugao Rice Terraces, sometimes referred to as the ""Eighth Wonder of the World."" They've been carefully carved from the natural contours of the region's mountains to produce terraced fields for planting rice.

How to get there: 
Take a bus bound for Banaue from Sampaloc. 

Or take a bus bound for Baguio from Cubao or Pasay, then transfer to a bus bound for Banaue.

Fun Fact: 
If put end to end, the total length formed from the Banaue Rice Terraces could reach halfway around the globe.

Amritsar, literally a Pool of Nectar, derives its name from Amrit Sarovar, the holy tank that surrounds the splendid Golden Temple. Guru Ramdas, the fourth Guru of the Sikh faith, founded Amritsar in 1579. He constructed a pool on land gifted by the Mughal Emperor Akbar and called it Amritsar. 

Home to the world famous Golden Temple, the 400-year-old city of Amritsar is the most important seat of Sikh history and culture. 

One of the most poignant memorials of free India -- Jallianwala Bagh – is also located in the city. Amritsar district was once a part of the vast area covered by the Indus valley Civilisation during the early period of history.

Legend has it that Gwalior was founded in 8th century AD by a chieftain known as Suraj Sen or Surya Sen of Kachwaha Rajput clan who, when struck by a deadly disease, was curd by a hermit-saint Gwalipa. As a mark of respect to the saint, he built the city of Gwalior after the name of the saint. 

Steeped in its past splendour it was ruled by several dynasties including the Pratiharas, Kachwahas and Tomars who have left imprints of their rule, in this city of outstanding palaces, sacred temples and glorious monuments. It is also the birthplace of great musician Tansen.

The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

Oh and this can be a great birthday present for you! 😙$$This Valentine's Day I will be flying off as it is part of my job. :( although we will be miles, even time zones apart, we will definitely Skype each other and celebrate Valentine's. It doesn't always need to be a grand occasion. As long as i get to see him or be with him, I'm happy. He's a best friend I can't live without and he pulled me through my darkest times. I love him always.$$When the clock strikes 12 tonight (16/01/16), it'd mean yet another milestone in our relationship - a decade. Happy 10th anniversary my love Min Yi Chua! Thank you for being the best boyfriend I can ever wish for, and also my best friend at the same time, for the past 10 years. (Yes, we are childhood lovers since secondary school😄)
I won't say our relationship is a smooth-sailing one, but I am glad we've survived a decade! Cheers to more decades to come! This coming vday will be our 10th vday tgt. It's definitely sth worth celebrating as this day didn't come easy. However, we aren't planning to go fancy restaurant or what not as we're saving up for our wedding day on 16/10/16. Rather, it'd be more of a simple twosome time at my house where I will cook his favourite dishes. Everyday is like vday when I'm with him <3
Hope to get this bracelet to mark this special day for us :)$$Koon Lim this valentine day will be such a special one because i m expecting our baby nuumber 1 and   we get to celebrate with little boy in my tummy  . This year we wont be able to book any restaurant because i know you know my cravings are different all times so on that day we will be like usual couple , dating and shopping for baby stuff and also waiting for the unusual cravings on that day and dine in any restaurant or hawker when food craving hit. What's more we dont celebrate our love just on valentine day . We celebrate almost everyday even when we fight. our love sparks even when conflicts start . And yes other than dating and eating and shopping, we also plan to have a heart to heart session at the beach when we can enjoy the breeze and also the night views !  Hope to take this opportunity to win and surprise 😆$$During Valentine's day, I would like to do something meaningful with my boyfriend by doing volunteer work to visit those that is less fortunate and spread the love to them. Everyday is a special day as long as i can spend time with him, we do not need to show our love to each other more especially on days like Valentine's day because we love each other so much that we do not know what is loving more. So we decide to share our over-flowing love by helping those that are less fortunate. As much as i want to ask my boyfriend to participate this contest with me to increase the chance of winning, but i decided not to in order to surprise him if i win the contest by sharing our love experience.$$Zhi Wei Lim this valentine's day I'll be the slave driver and ordering you to run errands (which I have not thought of) for our wedding in March 😂😂$$Well, my BF, currently my husband will be my travel mate this coming Valentine's day as we are going away for our honeymoon in Europe!

Haven't been spending much time ever since long distance started for us, so this is a chance to spend a lot of time tgt!$$Thie valentine i plan to bring my wife out for a walk and a day of dating. no fancy restaurant being booked at the moment because her strange cravings change everyday so i wont know what will she want to eat on that day . So we will be shopping till she hungry and bring her to eat whatever food she is craving for. and of course not to make her too tiring on her feet as she is pregnant , I will bring her to watch movie to relax her back as well as her feet. To us everyday is valentine day so on this day it wont be that special because in my heart she already taken the special place which words can't describe !$$Maybe snuggle and have a heart-to-talk chat. We're comfortable just like that. Or maybe cook / bake together. I'll be the helper, like usual, and he'll be my personal chef. But even doing nothing is fine. I just want to spend it with him.

The Simhastha Kumbh is an unrivalled celebration in India. The most popular legend regarding the origin of Kumbh Melas is the Samudra Manthan or 'churning of the ocean'. Gods and demons competed ¬ercely in the churning in search of the divine nectar of immortality. During this epic battle to capture the Urn (Kumbh) containing the nectar, drops of the precious liquid fell on four places – Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Nashik and Ujjain. Hence, river Kshipra became the enhancer of life and to celebrate this event since then the grand festival came in vogue. Kumbh Mela, is held once every twelve years at these four places and attracts millions of devotees.

Grand Simhastha, on the Ghats of the glorious Kshipra

The Ujjain Kumbh is celebrated when Jupiter ascends into sun sign Leo's quarter or the Simha constellation of zodiac, which is why it is called 'Simhastha'. The Simhastha is special in Ujjain as it is the seat of divine Mahakal - the Lord of all times. The ritual of bathing in the holy waters of Kshipra begins on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (March-April) and continues on various dates until the full moon shows up in the following month of Vaishakha.

Simhastha 2016 will begin on 22nd of April and will continue till 21st of May.

Sadhus of various sects from across the country assemble in Ujjain and mingle with ordinary people as they take their ritual dip in the holy waters of the Kshipra.!

This elegant festival actually lasts for one month in July, and has its two highlights, Saki-Matsuri, procession of 23 gorgeous floats will be held on July 17th, 9 am to 11:25 am and Ato-Matsuri, a procession of another 10 floats starts at 9:30 am on July 24th. 
Yoi-yama (Festival Eve), all floats with lighted lanterns are exhibited on the Shijo- Karasuma Area, is held on the evening from July 14th to 16th, and also from July 21st to 23rd. 
Not many people know about Byobu Matsuri (Displaying folding screen). During the festive period, from July 14th to 16th, the old textile merchant homes open up the entrance area of their homes or shops once a year. This would be an absolutely great opportunity.

Tubbataha Reef is the mecca of Philippine diving, and a superstar in the international diving scene. It's accessible only by live-aboard dive boats between the months of March and June. You have the chance to marvel at 11 species of sharks, over 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 12 kinds of whales and dolphins, and get this — 10,000 hectares of reefs.

Whitewater rafting in the Philippines started in Cagayan de Oro City, the country's ""Adventure Capital,"" in 1995. It was just a hobby for Rupert Domingo and Julius Bioco, but it flourished into a thrilling endeavor – not just for themselves, but for other adventure-seekers as well.

Now, tourists rely on their group's rafting expertise for an unforgettable adventure along the Cagayan River.

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

#bestyeyeintheworldI am still recovering from a massive sobbing fit as I type this, so do pardon me if there are any typos or grammatical errors. This year, my family's CNY reunion dinner went completely beyond my expectaitions.

Last August I came out to Mum and Dad, and was promptly kicked out. I had prepared for the worst, though, and moved in with a friend. So all went well, more or less, except for me being somewhat depressed and withdrawn. I was not expecting to be called back for the reunion this year.

Enter my maternal grandfather, Ye Ye, a.k.a. The Colonel. He retired from the Malaysian army as a colonel, and is still much respected in the family. The fact that he takes no crap from anyone probably helped that. I was about to go for a drink (alone) for my CNY eve, when he called me. What follows is a rough outline of what he said:

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

Ye Ye himself was at the dinner table, and stood up when he saw me. What he said right then still rings in my ears.

""This is XXXX. My grandson. Some of you think he is not fit to be part of this family home simply because he is attracted to men instead of women. Shame on you! If he leaves, I will too, and FUCK anyone who dares to tell me otherwise!""

The whole house went quiet, and Ye Ye told me to come over and have some food. I was in tears by then, and he told me not to cry, and that he was sorry for not doing anything earlier (according to him no one told him anything until the afternoon, whe=n he noticed me missing from my usual spot chopping vegetables). Dinner was a silent affair, but he did ask me a lot of questions about how I'd been, whether I was happy, so on.

After dinner, I went to see him in his room, and cried. I knelt down and asked for forgiveness for not continuing his family line and for having brought any shame to him. But this man, my grandfather, a military veteran, just told me that it was fine, and that I had done no wrong. That I had been enough of a man to speak the truth, and that by doing so, he was more proud of me than if I had chosen to live a double life. He did admit to some disappointment that he wouldn't get any great grandchildren from me, but in his words, 'some things in life are not meant to be'.

God bless you Ye Ye.

More fun in the ..The Philippines , officially known as the Republic of the Philippines , is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. To its north across the Luzon Strait lies Taiwan; west across the South China Sea sits Vietnam; southwest is the island of Borneo across the Sulu Sea, and to the south the Celebes Sea separates it from other islands of Indonesia; while to the east it is bounded by the Philippine Sea and the island-nation of Palau. Its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator make the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons, but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world’s greatest biodiversity. At 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 sq mi), the Philippines is the 64th-largest country in the world, consisting of an archipelago of 7,107 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Its capital city is Manila while its most populous city is Quezon City; both are part of Metro Manila.With a population of at least 99 million people, the Philippines is the seventh-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world. An additional 12 million Filipinos live overseas, comprising one of the world’s largest and most influential diasporas. Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands. In prehistoric times, Negritos were some of the archipelago’s earliest inhabitants. They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples who came from Malay, Indian, and Islamic states. Various nations were established under the rule of Datus, Rajahs, Sultans or Lakans. Trade with China also introduced Chinese culture and settlement, which remain present to this day.The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 marked the beginning of an era of Spanish interest and eventual colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. The Spanish Empire began to settle with the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi from New Spain (present day Mexico) in 1565 who established the first Spanish settlement in the archipelago, which remained a Spanish colony for more than 300 years. This resulted in the predominant religion in the country to be Roman Catholicism and it is one of two countries in Asia; the other being East Timor. During this time, Manila became the Asian hub of the Manila–Acapulco galleon trade.As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution, which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic; the Spanish–American War; and the Philippine–American War. In the aftermath, the United States emerged as the dominant power; aside from the period of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands. After World War II, the Treaty of Manila recognised the Philippine Republic as an independent nation. Since then, the Philippines has had an often tumultuous experience with democracy, with popular “people power” movements overthrowing a dictatorship in one instance, but also underlining the institutional weaknesses of its constitutional republic in others. The Philippines currently has one of Asia’s fastest growing economies, and the nation’s large population size and economic potential have led it to be classified as a middle power.$$yes !

Sanchi’s stupas, monasteries, temples and pillars dating from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The most famous of these monuments, Stupa 1, known as the Great Stupa, was originally built by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, the then governor of Ujjayini, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant from the adjacent town of Vidisha. Their son Mahindra and daughter Sanghamitra were born in Ujjayini and sent to Sri Lanka, where they converted to king, the queen and their people to Buddhism.

The Sanchi hill goes up in shelves with Stupa 2 situated on a lower shelf, Stupa 1, Stupa 3, the 5th century Gupta Temple No.17 and the 7th century temple No. 18 are on the intermediate shelf and a later monastery is on the crowning shelf. The balustrade surrounding Stupa 2, carved with aniconic representations of the Buddha, was added in the late 2nd century BC under the Satavahanas.

The adjacent Gupta temple no.17 was hailed by Sir John Marshall as one of the most rationally organized structures in Indian architecture. Though small, it was a herald of all the principles which went into the engineering of an Indian temple in the early medieval period. The Buddhas in the perambulatory surrounding Stupa 1 are not contemporary with the Stupa but belong to the Gupta period in the mid-5th century AD. The monastery and the temple with the tall pillars adjacent to Stupa 1 and the temple near the monastery on the crowning shelf illustrate the evolution of the architectural form after the 5th century Gupta temple.

Every 9th of January, the life-sized figure of Christ is brought out of the Quiapo Church to the Quirino Grandstand and from there, it's carried through town back to the Church by barefooted devotees yelling ""Viva Señor"" while a huge crowd attempts to touch the statue.

An annual event that started back in 09 January 1787, the Traslacion, as it is commonly called, has become a sacred devotion for many Filipinos around the country, such that the entire procession could last for almost 24 hours.

The longest traslación was recorded in 2012 which lasted 22 hours. In recent years, the procession has captured the attention of the international media for being one of the largest religious gatherings in the world.

VIVA SENYOR NAZARENO!$$It's not about da image,is about a faith on there heart.pic show how Filipinos having strong faith to God Jesus$$Yung sinasabe na imahen or idol ang sinasamba namen mga Katoliko. Tanong ko lang? Bakit tinayo ang bantayog ni Rizal sa Luneta? Simple answer: to commemorate his act of heroism and for what he did for this country. Bakit tayo may imahe ng Poong Itim na Nazareno? To commemorate the suffering of Christ before He was nailed on the cross. Yung imahe nya na nagsusuffer, parang nakakarelate ang mga ordinaryong Pilipino na naghihirap, na manalig lang sa Diyos at giginhawa ang buhay nila. Kahit hindi pa nila nakakamtaman yung maginhawang buhay mas lalo tumitindi ang pananampalataya nila sa Panginoon. Please respect our faith as we respect yours. The Fiest of the Black Nazarene is way of showing what faith can do to ordinary people like me and every devotee of the "" Itim na Nazareno "".$$Lord look not on their failure to serve you right,but forgive them & shows the right way to worship you in spirit & in truth$$Images and names of Jesus are all representations of many remarkable stages of HIS life. And so are the images and names of Mary and the saints. All created to remind us all of something important in line with the bible. Faith is what drives people to touch and kiss them. I am a Catholic, i used to when I was a kid. I realized, people who kiss and touch these images are driven by faith (either to ask for something and to express gratitude), which Priests and Bishops have no control of. I believe, we all have different means and ways of expressing our faith. No one can say which one is right or wrong. Only God can judge us all.

And i dont ask people to believe me or any of us. We and all the followers of the other religions are being judged, anyway. But keep in mind, we all have our own ways and rights practicing our faith. 

If one speaks on behalf of the bible then he she it they must exhibit that respect learnt from it.$$God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.  How can an idol or graven image create heaven and earth.  Graven image has ear but can not hear. Has eyes but can not see has lips but can not speak has feet but can not walk. True God is mighty, creator  of the universe , mountains bow down and the sea will roar at the sound of His name. Jesus Christ the second God of the Trinity.$$Rather than to judge the Nazarene devotees (and the Roman Catholic Church as a whole), it is better to know and understand the story and heart of each person. Know the facts, ask the devotees themselves, try to put yourselves in their shoes first.

His Eminence Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle shared wonderful insights regarding this. Please take time to read. God bless us all! 

http://www.cbcpnews.com/cbcpnews/?p=70617$$WILD and MISTAKEN ANALOGY.

I was surprised to see on my newsfeed two pictures. Picture of the golden calf being worshipped by the Israelites with a caption “NOON”. The other is a picture of the itim na Poong Nazareno being carried and held in procession by the devotees with a caption “NGAYON”.

While the one who posted it was giving a caution that the devotees of today or even the Catholic Church herself of committing the same mistake of worshipping an idol, it does try to make an analogy, i.e. they denote the same context. The innocent, ignorant, and uncritical viewer might make a quick conclusion and like, share, and make a comment of approval on it.

Regarding that post, I offer these nuances;

1. We, Catholics, had always been proclaiming that we do not worship images. When we use images, we satisfy our human need to see and to feel our God and saints by representing them. There is no way we will entrust our life and salvation to a piece of wood or any man made images.
2. While our actions maybe misinterpreted, what counts are what we stand for. The homily of His Eminence Cardinal Tagle in the fiesta mass early this morning responds partly to this. The dire need of the devotees make them commit some acts which maybe bordering or even tantamount to idolatry yet, deep inside, it is actually faith of a different approach but deep and meaningful anyway.
3. There is a lot of and great difference between the golden calf and the image of the Black Nazarene who is Jesus Christ Himself. The golden calf was a pagan representation while the Black Nazarene is our representation of Jesus, the Second Person of the Trinity, our Messiah. The devotion is drawn not by the image itself but the one being represented by the image. Can those devotees still worship without the image? The answer is that it maybe difficult but they still can. But why make it difficult when it can be made easier by those representation images?
4. The dynamics of the use of symbols and signs in worship come to mind. As human beings, we live with signs and symbols. We cannot live without them. The caution is to focus on the meaning of symbols and the messages of the signs. The bible is a symbol of the compilation of the Word of God. The letters and the words in the bible are signs (images) of the messages. Thus, those religions who claim that they do not use “images” are either telling a lie or are being deceived. To worship the bible as a book and not its content and messages is also bordering on idolatry. Remember, the Word of God came before the “bible” that we have now. Even without the “bible”, the Word of God still exists.

We were cautioned by that post. I throw the same caution in easily accepting or being misled by it.

Happy feast of the Black Nazarene!
(Just saying.)$$If you have the faith... No need to have pictures or images... A prayer alone is enough to remember the Christ the Saviour...$$This is your society on religion. 

If a hundred people were regularly injured at an annual rock concert, that annual rock concert would be investigated and shut down. But somehow we've come to accept and expect that a hundred people are injured consistently every year at a religious event. On many years, a number of people are even trampled to death. We would even be surprised if this year there were no deaths. Are you on drugs or something? I'm not.$$Black Nazarene is not worship as God. He is like an idol for others to follow the way he was been. An example of true believer of God.$$black nazarene help my whole family far from danger and mostly to have a good health especially me.This i ask in the name of our lord jesus christ amen.$$I will make this post for the information and the benefit of some Catholic. In Exodus 20, God made a covenant with Moses, explaining all the Ten Commandments. Now these stabbers rely on that from the Old Testament of the Prophets. These stabbers are like those meddling Hebrew teachers who scrutinized Jesus because of His teaching. They all ask questions trying to see the errors of His teaching but they failed. When Jesus started preaching, He enlighten this teachers including questions about marriage and the sabbath day. Now which teaching do you prefer, the Prophets or Jesus.? From Ten Commandments, Jesus made it two. So change was evident in the New Testament. Now why rely on the old scriptures? Jesus said ""I am the Light, the Way, the Truth and the Life, none can pass to the Father without passing through Me."" He also said, ""Though they have eyes, they will not see; though they have ears, they will not hear."" Now he is the blind and the deaf? May you be enlightened.$$Exodus 20:4-5. 4. Thou shalt not Make unto thee any graven Images, or  any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water. 5.  You shall not worship them or serve them, for I, the LORD your GOD. am a Jealous God,  visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me.$$Isaiah 44:9-12 all who makes idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame. Who shapes a god and cast an idol, which can profit nothing? People who do that will be put to shame; such craftsmen are only human beings. Let them all come together and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror amd shame. The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint.

Habakkuk 2:18 of what value is an idol carved by craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one  who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.

John 4:24 God is spirit, and his worshipper must worship in the Spirit and in truth.

Would rather obey God or your religion?

29    Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.

God invented and man invented religion.

Christianity is not a religion. Christians must choose between obeying religion or obeying God's law or commandments.$$I'm a catholic and I respect other people's beliefs. But saying that we need saints and mother mary as channel for our prayer to reach God, I guess we don't understand faith that much. God is all around us, with us, closer than we can imagine, 24/7. All we need is to simply talk to him directly thru a prayer. That's it. The problem with most of us Catholics is that WE RARELY READ THE BIBLE. We just believe what others tell us about religion and christianity. If we read the Bible, we'd think twice about going to religious processions such as this. When was the last time you read the bible? 😃$$One last post. Catholic does not worship or idolize the statues and images you thought they have worshiped. The image or the statue is a representation or the reflection of the life of Christ or any other Saints, their passion or sacrifice. Something a lot of you would not understand. If you do not believe in the image of Jesus it is a blank space, nothing really, only a void. We were not born when Jesus walked among man, so when you pray how would you imagine Him? In the presence of the image you can figure Jesus passion and sacrifice. It is like this, If you did not believe in the Crucifix, then you did not believe in the sacrifice of Jesus and salvation. Upon the cross, His sinless body laid, he died carrying the weight of all the sinners, to save us all. Upon the cross, our selves are deemed by His sacrifice, a sacrifice for our Salvation. Our faith binds us directly to Him, and by the image/statue/crucifix or cross, we can clearly see Jesus, strengthening our prayer because as we close our eyes, we can see Him and feel His presence. I hope that was clear. The Black Nazarene is a representation of Jesus' passion, imagine Jesus in flesh walking, carrying His cross with all those people reaching out for him.$$Be Safe there!! Hope it'll be Peaceful and successful celebration. May the peace and glory shall cover the world :) #BlackNazarene$$""No one including religious sectors is PERFECT!"" This is a free country same as the Philippines. Everyone has the right to choose what type of belief practices they chose to follow. Bless those who believe in the goodness and power of the Lord, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit!🙏👏$$Most of these stabbers focus on one text only from the Exodus, from the Old Testament, now Jesus came and His disciples compiled His teaching, on the New Covenant. Now how about this, we do ours do your. Have a little respect, respect our way because we didn't critcize your ways. Now if you don't respect us then do you think you have for yourself? Love the people around you and you'll recieve too. God's way is too complex none of us can reach, so for what He had installed for us, we'll never know. So live your own way. He knows everything, we don't. For whatever we do, judgement is always fair in the arms of the Saviour.$$Really incredible!!!
That's how Filipinos and many foreigners too fanatically join in venerating and processing this Black Nazarene .$$Please respect their faith,if you're not believing in image (statue) or if you are non catholic .You should give respect to catholic faith. Catholic believers not asking anybody to believe in statue or give you rosary or to invite you in the holy mass. So let the people pray and believe in any religion. #RESPECT #RESPECT #RESPECT$$For all of you who had bashed the Catholics. Here's something you might want to read to give you view of what we do. How our prayers are carried by Saints. Heres an example from the Virgin Mary. Here everything is explained and don't tell me Google texts are lies, well not all. And if you have more doubts, ask Vatican. http://www.theholyrosary.org/fatimaapparitions$$I was born and raised in Angeles city , Philippines till I left for Canada in 1974. We have a small church close to our house and there is the chapel call visitang Apu, there is our Black Nazareno lying there since the world war 2. People all over come and visit specially Fridays. As far as I can recall ,other Catholic Churches attempted to move the Black Nazareno but unable to. Now this church became a Shrine. All the remarks I have read so far make sense. Spirituality is a choice. Believe in faith or not.$$We respect your traditions and beliefs that's why for years, we are not complaining about it but when we gather in edsa to fight for our faith, most of you branded us as nuisance.may you have a peaceful and ZERO casualty celebration.

For those who are new, learn more about #chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) in our article here ☞ bit.ly/2cc8fIA ","Happy  Chuseok, In my State Karnataka,India, we have a harvest festival festival it is called Sankranti and we have family together also we do perform ancestor worship or paying homeage to our ancestors,,, but all this done in different months$$Chuseok is originally known as hangawi ""the great middle of autumn"",is a major harvest festival in KOREA, 
Like many other harvest festivals around the world,it is held around the autumn .
Harvesting preparation
Nabanna (New Crop) is a Bengali harvest celebration usually celebrated with food and dance and music in Bangladesh and in the Indian State of West Bengal. It is a festival of food; many local preparations of Bengali cuisine like pithe are cooked and offered.

The festival is celebrated with mela which are called nabanna mela. It is one of the numerous festivals that gave the name ""baro mase tero parban"" (thirteen festivals in twelve months ) to the land of Bengal. Although the nabanna parban is somewhat different from other ones since it is not connected to a religion such as Ratha Yatra. The villagers and locals from both the major religious groups join the festival with equal participation. There are also several fertility rituals which make the festival truly a harvest ritual. The festival gets a lot of support from the creative army of Bengali culture. Several poets, musicians, baul and painters flock to such mass gatherings. There is a famous play written on nabanna by Bijon Bhattacharya which depicts the sad incident of the great Bengal Famine of 1943.[1] Nowadays the Festival ""Nabanna"" is celebrating every Bengali year (1st day of Agrahayan) in Dhaka, organized by Jatiya Nabanna Utshab Udjapan Parshad (National Harvest Festival committee) since 1998. Mr. Shahriar Salam is main planner of the organization. There are huge number of cultural activists, organizations & performing in a day long festival.

Below is a description found in west Bengal on one such mela website.

""people from several villages of Howrah and even from other districts of West Bengal come here. People not only come to visit the Mela. In addition, they participate in many cultural programmes and competitions like 'Pithe Making' (Preparation of different sorts of Bengali Cakes), Seat-and Draw, Senior Citizens' Walking Competition etc. An ""Art-Camp"" may attract creative minded people where artists from different states will participate. Some rare items of rural Bengal as ""Dhenki"" (Old-style Domestic Rice Mill), paddy of different varieties directly from the farmers' house are to be exhibited in the Exhibition ground. You can taste some delicious Bengali dishes like Pati-sapta, Payesh (the latest addition is 'Vegetable Payesh'), Jilipipi (not Jilipi) etc. during the festival. Bengal's time-honoured culture and heritage will be presented to you in forms of Baul song, Chhou-dance, Jatra, Tarja, Kobi-gaan, etc. These artists come from different parts of the state to perform their talent and expertise in front of thousands of appreciative gatherings. Moreover, you can refurbish your collection of folk arts from the 'exhibition-cum-sale' stalls of handicrafts made by rural artisans.""[2]$$추석 잘 보내세요~~~
I think the closest thing we have to chuseok is EIDs ..there is plenty of food and plenty of relatives visiting ..  elders give money to youngsters which is similar too .. the only thing is that the money thing is related to eid-al-fitir while the food thing is about eid-al-adha .. but similar both of them 😁$$I'm from Saudi Arabia, I think you saw the Hajj in mekkah Snapchat story, it ends with a big celebration, in the last month of the hijry islamic year <3$$Hello, I am so happy to let you know about the Chuseok in my country, Vietnam ^^
It is said that originally, the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival came about as a way for parents to make up for lost time with their children after harvest season. The harvest was done by September, (August in the Lunar calendar) and the parents were anxious to spend time with their children and do something special with them, as well as celebrate the harvest, after spending much time working hard and away from the family. It was held under the full moon, which represents fullness and prosperity of life.

Tet Trung Thu is very much like a combination of our Halloween and Thanksgiving. Children parade on the streets, while singing and carrying colorful lanterns of different sizes. Some of the popular shapes include fishes, stars, butterflies and a lantern that spins when a candle is inserted, representing the earth circling the sun.

Dances are also traditional, and include the dragon dance and the flower dance.

It is customary to give Banh Trung Thu, boxes of moon cakes, which are traditionally very rich in taste. The cakes are filled with lotus seeds, ground beans and orange peels and have a bright yoke in the center to represent the moon.

Today, the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, as well as encouraging affection for children, promotes education, poetry, dance and arts and crafts.$$Today, we celebrate Trung Thu (Mid-Autumn Festival) in Vietnam too.

He has been sick since last October, but was just diagnosed last week. He will require 5-6 chemotherapy treatments, every three weeks. After each treatment he requires 6 doses of platelet, a part of human blood. The problem is, his blood type (B-), is not at all common in Korea. B+ is quite common, but B- is not.

Here's something different for our readers. In Singapore, most of us go through our lives like drones, getting all our ""skills"" from textbooks. But we never pay attention to the skills that will truly help us in life. The ones that matter. Like making new friends, building relationships and pushing ourselves off that ledge of comfort that we desperately cling on to. We fear the unknown and unfamiliar.

So where do you start? That's why we decided to write this guide.

Go out there and start talking to people. Rake up some smiles, meet your new business partner, talk to that cute boy/girl in line, find out about a cool new bar and so much more. Remember the next time you hesitate about talking to someone interesting, you could be missing out on a whole lot of life.

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University’s Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

I didn't understand korean (i started learning november2009) and I didn't even think about learning it since he can speak English well. We talk a lot, everyday, and I have this feeling that we have mutual feelings with each other. But you know, Filipina girls are really reserved(I am), so I waited for him to make the first move, I waited and Waited, but my waiting game dragged till mid 2009. Earlier that year, he would speak Korean to me randomly, ask questions or just random sentences I don't understand. I would ask him what it was but he'll just laugh it off and change the topic. So I really didn't bother, I was so focused on his presence. 
then one time I was watching a Historical Korean Drama, one phrase from the main actors dialogue sounds really familiar, bec he always say that to me. It was an old way to say 'I like You very much'. 
I almost kicked my laptop and remembered he alao mentioned a few times before, in korean, '저랑 데트이 할래?' in which i would just look at him puzzled in response. 
If I only knew the meaning of those words, maybe just maybe, we would've dated right?$$...😷😷😷 that is totally toxic. I don't want any guy treat me like a little girl that must take care of me.

What is it like? 
Soft corals prefer nutrient-rich waters and less light. They may look like plants, but corals are marine animals that need food. And this type feeds on zooplankton, or organisms incapable of swimming against a current – making it the ideal treat for hungry marine creatures. You can find soft corals in Anilao's colorful underwater gardens, which are home to all sorts of tropical fish.

Fun Fact: 
Some soft corals are not actually soft. They're more tree-like and flexible, and can dance gracefully in the waves.

This thought has always intrigued me, mostly because of the sense of appreciation for each. When it comes to experiences, we tend to only understand their importance in the long run. In the moment, we can of course enjoy them. However we may not be able to fully absorb their effect on us until much later on. On the other hand, materialistic belongings have their biggest value when first acquired. Like your mobile phone, for instance. The prized possession you couldn't take your eyes off of the day you brought it home, but has since become just another thing you have, and use. This is what propelled me to start traveling this past year, and I haven't looked back.

Ah, Boracay. Need we say more? Since much has been said, raved and written about this famous four-kilometer stretch of powder white sand paradise, we would like to suggest you try the most exhilarating activity off it — cliff-diving at Ariel's Point. The highest plank is about 15 meters high, which is as high as a five-storey building. But jump off and it ends with a safe, pleasantly wet landing. 

How to get there:

Not a lot of people know that Tribal Adventure Day Tours are offered on this island. These are no ordinary tours. You spend an entire day getting to know the indigenous people living In the area.

The shop has no employees manning the store and features a homemade Self-Checkout station similar to the ones you'll see in modern supermarkets.

Besides selling the usual basic necessities you'd find in normal mama shops around your house, the store also features old school snacks and goodies like the famous toy candies and wang wang cookies we all loved as a kid.

Despite its fully customer trust based system, there has not been many theft cases with only an estimated 2% being dishonest with their patronage.

Get passes to meet Song Seung Heon before his new drama drops!","Look, I'm not denying Seung Heon has good looks (just take a look at all the other comments!). In fact I believe he is one of the best-looking actors in the Korean industry. But the point I want to make is, actors should be judged beyond that - whether it is in terms of character, skill, intelligence or personality. To me, Seung Heon exemplifies all these qualities but the thing I value most about him is his craft. His impeccable acting in shows like My Princess, Summer Scent and many others, is unmatched. To be able to be in the presence of such a great actor would definitely be a dream come true.$$Wouldn't want to Miss this Precious Opportunity !!!

This is the only chance to get close ...😍😍$$Song Seung Hoon's character from Autumn in my heart has become a household favorite in the Philippines when the drama became such a big hit back home. I was nicknamed 'Oppa' (eventhough I'm a girl and they didn't know Oppa is for guys only) by my former colleagues as we used to binge watch My princess at work so, I guess it's a huge priviledge to meet him in person.$$Omg Janis Tan I hope one of us gets to see him in real life and no longer a dream for us!

He's also sooooo goodlooking 😍 I'm also a big fan of his acting - loved his cold yet thoughtful character in My Princess and his aloof character in Obsessed (He looked SO GOOD in the military wear!😍).

Photos courtesy of Seoul Metropolitan Government. ","To South Korea Government Official You Hyun Sik, Kim Su-Jeong & Korea Tourism Board,

You have been quoted in numerous news report claiming that foreigners ripped off by taxi drivers can claim a reward as compensation from the Seoul city government for helping to curb the rampant scams. This email serves to determine whether you are aware that your team is not carrying that out in reality, or if you know that but are simply making empty promises to the media.

I visited Seoul in September last year and unfortunately became a victim of 2 taxi scams. The first taxi driver tampered with the meter to charge me an extra 28,000 KRW. The second taxi driver appeared drunk, stopped multiple times to leave the meter running for extra money while grumbling to himself. When questioned, he turned violent to shout and swing his forearm towards me narrowly missing my forehead.

Trip details and receipts were reported to Seoul Authorities, Mr. Seongmin Lee and Mr. Jongjoong Kim. Thanks to their investigation, the errant taxi drivers were caught, with fines and warnings imposed. Your government officials also asked for my details and shared these with the driver when he promised to bank transfer the extra amount.

This turned out to be a lie - I was subsequently told that the driver only made the promise hoping the police will let him off, and now that he doesn't keep his promise, you government officials cannot do anything about it anyway!? My case was subsequently escalated to your rewards team for the compensation you publicly claimed to protect tourists from what I underwent.

After more than half a year (Sep15 - Present) of sending multiple email & email reminders, making many international phone calls to your office when nobody bothers to reply, I was told that my case is rejected.

The excuse your team gave: The Seoul team said that the taxi driver is from Incheon; the Incheon team said their compensation period started after my incident happened. Both sides refused to compensate. There was no mention on the second driver even though he is from Seoul, no compensation was given either.

Seongmin and Jongjoong helped to scrutinise the Seoul team reward legislations. They confirmed that there is ""no stated restriction for taxis from other municipal areas"", so by right my case perfectly qualifies. Nevertheless, there is little they can do if your rewards team unscrupulously insist on using that excuse which is clearly NOT in the legislation (nor in any of your news report) to avoid compensating tourists . Hence, my decision to take this directly to you and the South Korea Tourism Board.

It is bad enough that your taxis are out to scam tourists. Now even the Seoul government are trying to shirk responsibility, coming up with excuses using newly-imagined regulation to avoid compensating tourists & wasting 8 months of our time. With the authorities setting such a bad example in keeping promises, it is no wonder your taxi driver dares to promise compensation to the police then break his promise after that - He is just following in your footsteps!

Please take this as a public request for You Hyun Sik, Kim Su-Jeong & the tourism board to look into my case for compensation. Also take this as a public service announcement so that other tourists will not foolishly believe your word that the Seoul government authorities is actually protecting and compensating tourists ripped off by your taxi drivers.

Don't forget to share this with your friends on their VisitKorea trip as well!😘 ","I would love to try ganjang gejang. Seafood, especially crab, is one of the most vibrant and famous cuisine in Indonesia since it has so many islands which are surrounded by sea. So everytime I eat seafood here, it will reduce my homesickness. Crab is also my favorite food, it already tastes good without any seasoning. So I can't imagine how it will taste in soys-marinated sauce. I guess it will taste fantastic!

I suggested 'Gwamegi' (과메기) for you guys. When the winter season starts, one of my senior from Pohang gave me gwamegi. It is a famous half-dried fish which mostly eaten in the region of North Gyeongsang Province. My senior told me, we can only eat this kind of fish in winter season because it needs to be repeated freezing-defreezing outdoors. It tastes sweet, sour, rough, a little bit spicy; all in the same time. It is perfect to be consumed with garlic, chili, vinegared red pepper paste, wrap them around dried seaweed, and accompanied by a bottle of soju or beer. 🤤

Cc: Wendy William Christian Chandra Marcel Hidajat Winarto Hermawan Prajitno Aldo Pollardo Vincent Wirawan$$My Korean friend brought us to taste Sundae Soup on our first visit to Korea in 2012.

For Hongeo, it's an accident for me... because Jeonju Makgeolli House served all sort of excotic foods as anju (안주) to consumed with Makgeolli. To be frank, if I knew it's Hongeo I won't eat it. It's an accident as I thought it's hoe (회). As a sashimi lover, I just put the whole slice inside my mouth. The aftermath was horror to my mouth... really shocking experience to mouth, my tongue and my nose! Stinky ammonia smell like public toilet was really unbearable. I had to drink makgeolli and haejangguk to cleanse and purify contaminated area by the smelliest food I ever had in my life.😱😱😱  My hubby ate the Snails and Beondegi too. He had tasted Beondegi at Soraepogu Fish Market and he said it tasted nice. But, knowing that it's silkworm pupa I just too hesitate to put it inside my mouth unless I'm drunk~! Maybe I'll challenge myself to eat this Beondegi and Sannakji next time! 😶$$I would say Beondegi but I tried that last November during my #VisitKorea trip beside the Cheonggyecheon stream so in April I'd like to try the Hongeo 😍. i expect this to be a little slippery but tasty. I am so looking forward to it.$$I would like to challenge myself with this....Cheonggukjang AKA “Dead Body Soup”. They say its odor is so strong and repellant to many. The soybean paste used for this soup is only briefly fermented, which means that much of its strong ammonia smell remains. It has largely whole soy beans which stick together with a slimy, gluey substance. But, despite the dreadful description and smell,they say it's incredibly delicious. Victor Valle Otero$$I would try them all, but since I have to chose only one, I think I'll side with Dak Bal. I also like pig feet and reeeallyyy spicey things, so it would be similar I think. Alsooo, I want to try bingsu so much... it's not as special as the others on this list, but those look absolutely delicious.$$I want to challenge myself with these two korean foods which are Maeun Ddeokbokki and Ganjang gejang. First, I want to try the one which is the Maeun Ddeokbokki. I saw this food in one of the korean drama. The first time I saw this food was I already think that this food was really good. I want to challenge myself to eat more spicy food like this spicy rice cake because I want to try to eat rice cake with mix of chili sauce. The one thing really good to this food is its easily purchased from street vendors anytime you want to eat this. 

             Since Im young I really like seafoods that's why Im anticipated to try Ganjang gejang because I want to try new taste and new meal beside of fried crabs. I want to eat this dish that made by raw crabs marinated in soy sauce. I will eat this crab meat with rice even with my bare hands until the last bite of it. 

        I recommend to others to try the stir-fried jjukkumi that marinated in red chili sauce because it has a great taste and good for health.$$안녕하새요.. I would like to challenge both 간장게장 (soys – marinated crab) and 닭발 (chicken feet) dish .. I would love to try  닭발 because I once saw Apink Chorong eating it on Apink Showtime and for 간장게장 , I fell in love for it when I saw Running Man member eat it on the show. There are various type of Korean dish that often shown on Korean dramas and reality shows. 
This event is good because it can introduce unique Korean dish to non Koreans. Based on my experience, I would like to recommend 떡볶이 (tteokbokki) for those who craving for late snack and tteokbokki cheese for those like less spicy food. And for those that want challenges, eat Beongdegi (번데기) (steamed silkworm larvae). 감사함니다 ~ <3$$I would try a few. The sundae (blood sausage). Gopchang (intestine) Hongeo  (skate) and Ganjang gejang  (soy marinated crab) sounds amazing. I actually have had maeun ddeobkbokki (spicy rice cake) I love spicy food but it was too hot for me.$$I would like to try 떡볶이 (ddeokbokki)!! I'm really in love with kdramas and this meal is very popular among them...I love spicy food and ive been told that ddeokbokki can be spicy so that sounds great.....

Another meal I would like to try but also i would recommend is ""heotok"" wich is the korean version of pancakes, right?? So thats it (theres a lot of meals Id Like to challenge like ""bulgogi"" or ""jajjamyeon"" i expected both to look and be appetizing)

Cant wait to try them all~~!!$$I would like to taste the Sannakji because this is what I am looking for when visiting Korea, to see and taste things I could not anywhere else. Seafood is what is not avaible everywhere. And if I like it, then the ganjang gejang can come. 🙂$$When I visit Korea one day I really want to try kimchi. I know it's not on the list but I love cabbage and fermented cabbage just sounds delicious. I am so curious about the street food there.$$I think Dwejimori, Ojingeochae, Bosintang and Onnuriye Donkatsu are challenging enough, but maybe with enough Makgeolli they will be just fine. 짠!$$I'd like to take on the Dak bal (chicken feet) challenge. I expect it to be gut-twisting spicy but my skin would glow from all the collagen I ate.$$탕탕이!!! 
I really want to try 육희낙지탕탕이!!  Minced raw beef and nakji with raw egg. Been wanted to try it since I watched Eric oppa made it on three meals a day.$$It'll be hard but I want to challenge Beondegi and Hongeo. They both are known to have strong smells so it'll be a hard challenge :)$$I would challenge the ganjang gejang. I'm not really big on sea food but crab marinated in soy sauce doesn't sound too bad !$$I would to try Beondegi (Pupa) ^^ After watch my friend's video about challenge to eat beondegi, i really curious about the taste, is it yummy ?? ㅋ But i think i'm so scared to eat it .. In Indonesia, we know about the food like beondegi, but we can't find it easily like in Korea. And yeah it full of protein and vitamin, i think i should eat beondegi as snack at my office if i'm feel so hungry 😂
Let's watch my friend's video ⬇

And i would to recommend Onnuriye Donkatsu (Pork cutlet). Just see this photo and you can feel the hoooooottttt ~~~ I really don't like spicy food but i would to try this one, maybe just a little 😅

If you want to try this, you can find at Onnuriye Donkatsu, 355-23 Sindaebang 2-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul; +82 2 823 8589
