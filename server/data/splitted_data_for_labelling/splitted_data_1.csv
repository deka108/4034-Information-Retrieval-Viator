What is it like? 
You’ll find these huge mounds that look like chocolate kisses scattered throughout the towns of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan in Bohol. Their numbers are estimated to be around 1,268 to 1,776.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Tagbilaran.

Or take a boat from Cebu or any of the major cities in Mindanao to Tagbilaran.

Both a volcanic island and a marine reserve, this island has become a favorite diving destination in the southern Philippines.

What is it like? 
Schooling is when a group of fish swim together in one direction. They do this to fend off predators by creating a ""confusion effect,"" where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

Fun Fact: 
Shoaling is different from schooling. Shoaling is when a group of fish is grouped closed together, but each one is swimming independently. . Tubbataha has 600 species of fish that either school or shoal.

Thanks for sharing :) @Jennifer, The idea of having dogs inside one's house is a little strange in Korean society.  Think about how you should take off your shoes before you go in the house in Korea, well dogs don't have shoes to take off, so it can seem a bit unsanitary to Korean people.  There may be hotels that accept it, but you would have to ask when you make a reservation. ""it's better to beg forgiveness than ask permission"" could also be a good mantra to follow, but there's no telling how it will turn out.    If your dog is loud, or causes damage, it could be a very costly affair for you.  There are such things as dog hotels in Korea (this one is in Korean, but just take a brief look: http://hotel.dogtel.co.kr/) it could also be a good choice.

Women are roses raised on different soils,
Their color may vary from place to place,
but their roles are permanently synonymous to the word Importance,
Their beauty transcends universe boundaries,
They can charm us both on pageantry and admire them in warfare,
They are our nectar in paradise and may turn to venom if abused.
They are our mothers who swing our future leaders & heroes hammock,
On our young age, They are our first trainers for us to become future workforce of the world.
They are our wives that warm our home with their love,
They are our sisters in playground and nurse that medicate our wounds in battlefield we chose,
They are our daughters who bring smile to our dolorous exhausted soul,
They are our doting grandma that console us candies and toys in our tantrum.
They are friends in armor when perturbation make our mind consumed,
They are the symbol of blindfolded justice, of liberty, of affection...
Lady Luck is their name sake, their lovely eyes are replete of vision.
They are light of the house that brings hope to the hopeless...
They are the symbol of motherland of every nation in this world...
Women are roses that can tame a gun with its scent,
They can tone down heated conflict by the  wisdom of their verses.
Their thorns will draw blood once it pricks be it by pauper or conqueror's hand,
Women are conduit of Life to infants who feed on their bosoms.
Miracles of Life starts from their womb,
Their Delicate petals can both kiss the morning dew and the scorching sun,
Their non-existence is humankind decimation,
They are consoling flowers for our natal,  betrothal, nuptial, until the funeral.
In both victory and defeat their buds soothes our senses,
Because They are Roses in all of our Life's occasion,
Roses that melt hearts and touches soul by mere sight & redolence.                                                                                                                  Women are sent by God to be of equal importance of Men...

The first stage. All stages will be three.
The sources of rivers - is washed with water gorge. Between two mountains set 10 baths. Obtain a ladder height of 100 meters. Water flows from the tenth to the ninth bath tub. With nine baths - in the eighth, and so on to the bottom of the bath. From the bottom of the bath water flows in a specially dug the lake - an area 4.3 square kilometers - storage of cold water.
Production of crystal clear enriched in trace elements and chilled fresh water.
The principle of operation of the technology. Know height growth per km, provides cooling of 6.7 degrees. That is, the water bath cools in the tenth to 0.67 degrees, at the bottom - by 0,067, and the average - to 0.335 degrees. How much does it - a lot or a little? - There Are Many. Increase in global temperature of 0.05 degrees. Divide one by the other, and we get the result: technology has reduced the temperature of the inflow of 6.7 times. This is a great indicator. Such technologies on the rivers of the Philippines will need as much as possible - up to 25-30 pieces. They will cool in a month and all the rivers before flowing into the ocean.

This technology Philippines can build without me. A month later, you will get positive results, and call me. I will bring more powerful technology, and all the rivers of the Philippines will be restored. It will irrigate arid lands and pastures. Build new farms.

One beneficiary from such phenomenon is Kuya Rudy Hecho, a driver and tour guide from Sabtang Island in Batanes, whose story is told by Nethaneel Jao (@thedeafmutespeaks).

""Driving over the steep cliffs of Sabtang Island, Batanes in a cogon-roofed tricycle is probably one of the most memorable moments in my traveling life. Every turn of the road was another breathtaking scenery, and every village, new faces.

""My driver and tour guide, Kuya Rudy Hecho, has been living in Sabtang for as long as he can remember. So much so that he's gotten used to the incredible landscapes that have brought in many tourists for the past years. And in between our cheery conversations about the Ivatan culture and some pointers on common Ivatan courtesies and words, he would tell me how tourism in the island has boomed over the past decade.

""Flocks of visitors would come every month, amazed by the grandeur of Batanes. With his unique and charming cogon-roofed tricycle, he offers guided tours around his home island, as well as accommodations for those who wish to spend the night in Sabtang. With this, he is able to support his family and, at the same time, share with his guests a part of his wonderful culture and the joys of a simple life for them to bring home as priceless memories.

In fact I believe he is one of the best-looking actors in the Korean industry. But the point I want to make is, actors should be judged beyond that - whether it is in terms of character, skill, intelligence or personality. To me, Seung Heon exemplifies all these qualities but the thing I value most about him is his craft. His impeccable acting in shows like My Princess, Summer Scent and many others, is unmatched. To be able to be in the presence of such a great actor would definitely be a dream come true.$$Wouldn't want to Miss this Precious Opportunity !!!

You will never be bored again.","And massages by the Singapore Visually Hadicapped?$$Do you know, besides SOTA being covered with greens.  We do have a butterfly trail in Orchard Road?  Real butterflies, purposely lured to Somerset down to Dhoby Guat with the selective planting of flowers along the walkways?$$For Asian Civilisations Museum, there was and is plenty of activities there for free.  Most recent was the Holloween Night.  And its free!$$Eat at Annalakshimi and pay as you wish.$$And have great Samosas and Chai Masala at the Sikh temple. Free of course, but ladies will need to have a shawl to cover their heads as they go into the temple.$$Then there is the Sembawang Hot Springs?$$Reflections at Bukit Chandu, I redirected a school with plenty hyperactive boys to visit that WW2 museum there.  Walk thru Hort Park where there are plenty of spaces to run around as well plenty of old school swings and plant covered little shelters to sit and generally have a cosy chat, hike up the little hill to the museum and hike down the other side.$$Thank you for sharing. You could include the MBS laser light show that happens everyday for free. Nice view of our CBD buildings at night too. :)$$This is a good starting point but not sure they are the top 52. Here are some other ideas, in addition to noting that 1/Legoland is in Malaysia and doesn't count! 

2/ Food Playground or another cooking school is a great way to learn about Singaporean cuisine - get involved
3/ Krangi memorial on ANZAC Day
4/ Sembawang Yacht Club
5/ Add in the view towers on Pulau Ubin and MacRitchine
6/ Visit a local brewery - tiger or jungle beer
7/ charter a boat with friends to see outer islands
8/ one of them has a crab festival - name escapes me
9/ East Coast Parkway Hawker Centre has chilli crab and can sit on beach - also reasonable price but annoying to get to
10/ Sentosa Fort
11/ Dragon boating, get involved before Christmas row competition which goes along boat quay
12/Go to the Paranakan house owned by NUS
13/ Malay Heritage Centre near Arab street - good for a feed but alcohol free
14/ The Green Corridor - where railway used to be -good for chilling, picnic and walk
15/ See a Chinese Opera around Hungry Ghost

Last week, wires obstructing the sightline of Plaza Roma, from which the centuries-old Manila Cathedral is situated, have been finally removed, giving visitors, photographers, and Instagrammers a better view of the Cathedral.

Besides discovering the region's history, culture, food, and people, we want to venture to the various historical sites such as the Temple of God of South Sea, the Muslim Sage's Tomb, and Hualin Temple.

From the old 四合院, magistrate's housing, exquisite details on buildings with hundreds of years history, it is a truly humbling experience. 
It has always been a wish to visit different parts of China & Guangzhou is one of the top on my list. 

Also, I have heard of all the nice food over at Guangzhou & my classmate who is a Shanghainese has been trying to get me to go together, promising me an experience I would never forget, which makes me even more excited on what would I be able to experience over at Guang Zhou!

To be honest, Guangzhou has never come into my mind until this post and now it has gained my interest to visit this place. Would definitely love to visit it together with the TSL host, if i have the opportunity. I believe it will also be a good opportunity for me to know more about this place. :)$$WOW Guangzhou!? I wanna #scootwithTSL there with my best friend Min Lin! Lately, she has been caught up in tracing her Cantonese heritage and even signed up for Cantonese culture/dialect classes! This would be a brilliant opportunity for her!! 

Plus we're both geographers trained in urban studies and endlessly fascinated by the urban landscape of China which desires to be trendy yet maintains its rich heritage and culture. Guangzhou is a really a special city - a world class vibrant metropolis sitting beside the calming yet spectacular Baiyun mountain! 

Sans the geeky obsessions with cities and landscapes, we are two super outgoing & fun loving best friends who love capturing beautiful moments, savouring yummy food (omg DIMSUM!!!!) and enjoying wild adventures + exciting nightlife. & of course, girls will be girls...

Other than the urban side of Guangzhou, I would love to explore the remains of the olden China with Rayvern Chng! There will be lotsa exploration, eating and of course shopping. We will be able to into an adventure (:$$I so wanna go guangzhou with you, firstly I know you're a fun loving person and friendly I like to be with someone like you, and definitely this trip will be an awesome n fun trip ever! You can find scores of gorgeous natural parks and historic spots interspersed in this modern city, such as White Cloud Mountain and Chen Ancestral Shrine. Modern buildings and theme parks in the urban area, like Canton Tower and Chimelong Holiday Resort, mark Guangzhou as an international-level developed city. There are many shopping streets and shopping centers in -Guangzhou covering everything that you might need. Food from china especially dim sum and shopping is my favourite pasttime. Lynn Ngai$$I want to go guangzhou with my sister!! As we have never travel together since a really long time ago, and both of us have never been to guangzhou before.. We been both tied down with work. If we could just get sometime away from work to go travel together, better still that the traveling is free, that would be the nicest ever weekend for a start in the new year! <3$$I wish to be chosen with Jay Chong to #scootwithTSL to Guangzhou because it's to celebrate our friendship of 6 years and counting together! We first met in poly, when his first impression of me was that I'm cold, aloof and distant; to me, he was a habitual latecomer. Our negative impressions of each other only improved when we were serving NS together; he sought me out thru MSN, and we started hanging out together, and got rid of the negative connotations we had of each other. We spent our nights out together and went clubbing til we were dead drunk on the evenings and bitched about horrible superiors in NS. Fast forward 6 years, our friendship is still strong despite hiccups along the way, and we are STILL bitching about our superiors, this time at work. So the free Guangzhou trip would be good for us to go on a holiday together ever since our last one a few years back! =)$$My buddy and I had never been to GuangZhou before. Meantime, as we are graduate from poly soon and planning to travel to GuangZhou for our graduation trip this year. this giveaways are surely suitable for us. Hope to win this travel package and we will definitely enjoy the trip!! We always want to visit GuangZhou as it is well-known for its foods, shopping as well as sightseeing. Hope to win!!!$$What??

And it would be great to have a chance to step on new grounds with open eyes and open minds to just absorb and learn. Everywhere new to me is an adventure and I would hope to have a chance to be part of an amazing adventure! (:(:$$I have never been to Guangzhou before and it be great to have a well-deserving break after a year filled with submissions from design school. Also!!! I would be able to visit my friend who is residing in GZ. It be a plus to be able to bring my mother along!! It's been a bad start of a new year with one of my uncle passing on.

I want to go to Guangzhou because traveling to China and being able to experience it's colorful medley of sights and sounds has always been on my bucket list. China is a country steeped in history and heritage, and even with the inexorable modernization of parts of this vast, beautiful land, vestiges of that heritage remain with fierce resistance. It is this dichotomous existence of awe-inspiring futuristic buildings, modern landscapes, and yet age-old monumental structures and natural scenic environment of mountains and rivers that I seek to experience all in one place, and Guangzhou city is the epitome of that! I would probably cruise along Pearl River, visit Guangzhou's markets, witness for myself the phenomenal White Clouds Mountain, not to mention, go for some shopping (who needs Taobao when you have Guangzhou?!), relish the Cantonese cuisine (I want to taste the mouthwatering XIAO LONG BAOS!!!!!!), and the list might never end! Please take me to my wonder destination! ✈️🇨🇳

Ps: Please believe that I am a hardcore fan of China, I even took up China Studies back in junior college. Taobao is also my best friend. My father is also a huge fan of China which probably explains everything.$$Would love to SCOOT to Guangzhou as I've never ever been there!

You can find cards featuring summer related items such as hydrangea, morning glory, and goldfish hitting the shelves at this current season of the year.
When you are travelling in Japan, choose your favorite and send a message to your family and friends in your country.

Literally meaning ‘cow’s ear,’ the quant town of Gokarna in Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka is formed by the ear-shaped confluence of two rivers and the favourite haunt of Hindu pilgrims, Sanskrit scholars, and beach buffs. Om Beach, one of Gokarna’s five famed beaches, takes the shape of an “Om”, a Hindu spiritual symbol.

The other beaches, wedged between gigantic cliffs that protrude like delicate fingers into the sea, are Gokarna, Kudle, Half Moon, and Paradise. The drive up the winding path that leads to Gokarna is a scenic delight with rocky mountains and the Western Ghats on one side, and the Arabian Sea on the other.

Ask u guys here, how many of u ever wondered how the waste water from ur shower during ur live-aboard trip or during ur stay in resort is affecting the environment? How many of u divers here always strive not to touch the rock/coral/surface during any of ur dive, unless it is necessary?? 
Everything starts from an individual. Let's do some goods.$$cool .. Indonesia is diving capital of the world ! you have more then half of the world's best dive spots ! Komodo, Raja Ampat, Lembeh, Wakatobi, Maluku, Gorontalo, Togean the list is endless ...$$We found Raja Ampat truly unspoilt. However, it is a direct result of the high cost of getting there. I suppose it will be a matter of time before prices fall with more diving operators setting up shop.

It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University’s Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

The Holy Mass is not for entertainment; it is for the glorification of God and for the sanctification of the Faithful. There is a proper time and place for everything; the Mass should be reserved for worship, not for unliturgical acts and greetings. Lastly, most of us are Roman Catholics, hence, we follow the Roman Rite. The Roman style of worship is rigid, concise, and solemn in nature. Clerics should not innovate and personalise the rituals in the Holy Mass. If it is not written in the rubrics and in liturgical documents, it should not be done. -- It's a blessing that the priest accepted his mistake.

Thanks Kimberly and BodyPerfect for this opportunity ! :)$$Really would want to win this give away as I have NEVER been to a facial before!

Due to this, sometimes it's really hard for me to improve my complexion and to buy skin care products *cries*$$I've never been to a facial as I never knew which one was good, I've always had problematic skin (too dry then too oily and outbreaks every now and then) but never really knee how to deal with it. Add on a busy schedule and I've never had time to really delve deep into getting the complexion I wanted. Really hope to try this out! :)$$I am always troubled by the amount of blemishes on my face and I have tried many different products and solution to resolve it but it never worked!

Would like to try out myself if it really works with my skin.$$would like to win this as I have not done any facial treatments before!$$I would like to win this because I've always had troubled skin regardless of the effort that I put in to maintain a proper and well structured skincare regime. I hope that I can achieve clearer skin and maintain it from there on! Furthermore, I'm still a student thus the luxury of doing a facial (that is worth 3 digits) would seem far unless given this opportunity!$$Liked & shared :D

Siquijor, Visayas

How to Get There:
Take a boat from Cebu to Siquijor.

What is it?
The island is famous for its virgin beaches and secret swimming spots. But the thing about Siquijor that probably resonates the most is its reputation for magic and sorcery. During Good Friday, the island is supposedly the go-to place of witchdoctors from all over the country who are looking to recharge their amulets.

Fun Fact:
Local healers can concoct potions made from oils and herbs for visitors to take home. A scented lana (coconut oil-based ointment) made by a healer is believed to relieve one of stomach aches and body pains.

This is a ceremonial visit paid by families to their guardian shrines so that parents can offer gratitude for their childrens’ health and well-being. Celebrations are carried out on November 15th or the month of November for boys who reach the age of 3 or 5, or for girls who turn 3 or 7 years old. The custom is for the children to dress in their best clothes and to carry “Chitose-ame” which are long thin candy sticks colored in red and white, believed to bring good luck.

adapters for different countries are such a pain to begin with, let alone needing to charge everything I need to charge via USB from iPhone to GoPro to Power Bank to Quodos Light. (wah, see, 4 items, just nice)

no more fighting for power with my Macbook, Camera Batteries, Flash Batteries, omg - everyone travelling with me will hate me less for hogging all the power but anyways!! 

then they should just get their own xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger + power bank too hahahaa.$$Would love to have xPower PB10Q Power Bank... Always wanting to travel and capture my favourite moments. But somehow my phone goes into Low battery and did not have the chance to take my special moment! Hope this will help enhance my gadget efficacies...esp when I'm a gadget amateur!! Hope to win this!!$$Liked and shared! I would like to win the xPower PB10Q Power Bank as a birthday gift for my boyfriend! I think these power banks are made for people like my boyfriend who on internet for 24 hours, playing games, researching, snapping pictures especially, navigating at the same time even when overseas. We love traveling and will travel at least once or twice a year therefore, we really like to own this powerful gadget! (:$$i would say that xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save me when i am travelling, i need to charge my portable wifiegg and phone so that i can last a day with wifi when i travel !$$The charger is a lifesaver especially when I depend on my iPhone to capture moments on top of communicating and navigating. I also like to share the moments I capture and also revisit them during my free time. This charger ensures that there will never be a moment I can't capture. The multi 5 USB ports just makes things even better! Now 4 other friends enjoy such certainty as well (:$$I need that xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger during travelling. There's limited power supplies in the hotel room. Sometimes, u will forget to bring power extension too.

It's always a pain to charge everything at night from phones to cameras, flash batteries to Power Bank. With this awesome xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger, there will be no more hogging to the power supplies! :)$$I would love to gift the xPower WC3QT travel charger to my boyfriend as he often charges his devices (laptop and especially phone as he always play game)! It's important that he gets all his devices charged up and be ready for both school and work, and also when we travel together at a later time of this year! Since he's such a forgetful person, this multi-functional charger would benefit him a lot!$$I m always lugging around 3 portable batteries as I need to charge my iPhone and iPad! Please rescue my shoulders as they are aching everyday from the load I carry. I need xPower DC5S Charger to charge my iPad, my phone and my portable fan to keep me from fainting in this heatwave.$$The xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save my life because my phone's battery life is quite short. It would definitely need a mid-day charge if im using it actively as my GPS$$I think the xPower PB10Q Power Bank would be very apt to save my life from a dead phone. It's less a question of need but one of want, as my current portable charger is good for one charge and is the size of a KitKat. So this is less of an entry into a lucky draw, but more of a plea for a better, longer, phone life. PLEEEEEEAAAASSSEEEE$$xPower DC5S Charger will save my life whenever I'm overseas cos the number of available sockets in hotel rooms are either too far apart till my items are everywhere or there are simply not enough sockets for me to charge my phone/dslr battery/portable charger. With this, at least I can consolidate all my tech devices together without having to worry about leaving one behind! :)$$Liked & shared. I hope I can win the xPower DC5S Charger as I'll be going overseas next month & my family of 4 will be squeezing in one hotel room! This means that we need to fight for the electrical sockets to charge our devices when we reached back in our hotel room. So it would be perfect to owe the xPower DC5S Charger to increase the efficiency by charging so many our devices at the same time! Furthermore, the added advantage of the xPower DC5S Charger is that it comes with a removable handphone stand so that our devices will not be wandering around and we can save the hassle of finding them! :-)$$Liked and shared!

I definitely need the xPower DC5S Power, though it's a close fight with   xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger.

Given that I usually travel with someone else, getting enough power points for our numerous gadgets is a massive headache.

Count this: Camera (ok, not fair to count it cos it doesn't use USB but it does take up one power point on its own), portable power bank, phone, tablet, smart watch, and iPod (yes, I'm old skool... Cos I don't wanna drain my phone's batt.) and then multiply by the number of travelers and you roughly get the idea of how many power points we will need if not for the multi-USB charger. I can bring my own travel adaptor for just one charger and that's it.

Wei Ling Bimira, you'll agree...$$xPower DC5S Charger will definitely be a life-saver, not only for myself, but for fellow travellers in my group, especially on long road trips with no power source in sight. =)$$Item: the xPower PB10Q Power Bank. I need it to charge my phone whenever it runs out of battery whilst im overseas. Caused me to not be able to take photos and even, record beautiful moments.$$xPower PB10Q Power Bank will be my life saver!
I'm a heavy phone user and can't last a few hours without my phone!

In truth, there is still a shortage of hospital beds and may or may not be solved even after the announced hospitals are built (Sengkang General Hospital for example) because these are geared more towards a 6.9 million population planning!!!

So the right thing for ALL young people should be:

1) Getting a private shield plan that is fully payable by Medisave (Except riders, so some savings in cash is still needed)

2) Medisave will only capped at $49,800 in 2016 and increase it annually as needed. 

Excess will be parked at Special Account.

But given that an average uni grad starts to work at 25 at 2015, in 30 yrs time with an annual average inflation of 3%, the CPF Minimum Sum would be around $390,000 by the time reach 55.

BUT, your CPF LIFE payout is only $1,200 since currently the CPF LIFE payout has no provision for inflation adjusted payout.

In then's terms, it is about $495 in 2015 value.

So in short, there is no incentive to park the money in Medisave, and one gets better benefits in a Class A or even private Hospital, most importantly is about securing a hospital bed!!!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

For 5 years I am an active user of SONY VAIO LAPTOP and SONY PLAYSTATION and very satisfied with the SONY products. For 6 years I use mobile phones from Apple and that what I have to complain about, that happened to me in these 6 years with any of my Apple products.
Through the media, my attention was drawn slowly but surely on the SONY deals on smart phones and was on November 22, 2014, I became a member of the Sony family, because I bought the Sony Xperia Z3 COMPACT (IMEI 355179065283809). First of all I was annoyed that I had not sooner worried me the phone because I loved the design, battery life and until I broke the glass of the back in my pocket by the software about two weeks ago and I injured my finger , Although I have understanding that it may be different in reality than promised in the ads, but that the back so fragmented, although it has come to a pointed object, surprised me very much.
I brought the phone to the competent charging and not surprised that I did not meet the warranty conditions and had to pay 90 TL for changing the glass back. Finally I sat down on it. It has lasted two weeks until I got the phone.
I realized immediately that the Proxmity sensor was not working and was told by the service that the Geraet was incorrectly installed and repaired it. After all the trouble I used the mobile phone full of joy and bought an expensive protective cover to protect it from further unexpected accidents.
But the blow came faster than expected and has brought the camel's back. Last night as I wanted to put me into the car, the phone fell out of my pocket on the ground, there was a height of 30 cm. The glass of the front and the back broke, even though it was in the case is a thousand pieces. I can not afford absolutely no understanding that the phone after a fall of 30 cm can come into this state. None of my friends can not believe it that the phone came with a simple fall into this state.
I'm really disappointed in Sony because they have such bad use or sensitive material, without considering that there is some device (finally a '' MOBILE '') which should withstand some shock or mishaps. For me it's just firmly around held between two panes of glass with fine black-cheap plastic thing that simply join in anything. Frankly, I'm disappointed in myself that I have the Sony familiar advertising and have too little research on the user comments had experienced in the hundreds same.
I can not understand that Sony has chosen as a marketing strategy that finally we have no complaints million per country, only a few hundred. I also do not see that it enters the warranty conditions, although the choice of the material just heard of being attributed to producers and for which the user is not enough information has been advised of the sensibility of the glass.
I should point out that I will do everything possible to make my consumer protection claims and as long as this publicly manifest until I get my right because SONY  Turkey does not take any action and they do not give my money back or change my phone!!! Please help me about this problem as you do to your customers in the United States Of America and United Kingdom and Japan.
With best regards

We respect your opinion regarding this list. We know that there are others equally deserving of this title. This post was meant to celebrate Filipino pride from all industries, regardless of whether the person was born/raised in the Philippines or not. Hope that clarifies things! :)$$The list itself doesn't bother me, but the title definitely does! One could so easily come up with a much better list of ""27 Filipinos who make you proud to be Pinoy""!!! Filipinos who actually consider themselves Filipino!!! (Admittedly, there are a few people on the current list who actually meet that criterria, thank goodness!).

The question of Philippine identity and colonial mentality is worth examining further. I find it ironic that #21 Jose Antoniio Vargas, is famous for launching the website and movement DEFINE AMERICAN, in which he argues that being American is not about your citizenship or legal status in the US, it is about whether you consider yourself an American, which he does. I respect his right to define his own identity, which makes it all the more ironic to find him listed here.

So the question is, how do you DEFINE FILIPINO? From this list, apparently, one doesn't have to even ever have been to the Philippines, speak the language, or in any way claim Philippine identity and culture as your own, it is sufficient to have a Philippine ancestor (no matter how distant) somewhere on your family tree?

I understand that the list is meant as a bit of fun, but the title warrants more serious examination.  No offense to anyone who is a fan of those on that list...

The Filipino word for hello is ""have you eaten?"" That gives you an idea of how important food is to the people of the Philippines. Fruits, vegetables, root crops and rice are staples of the Filipino diet. And with water crisscrossing every part of the Philippines, so is fish. A traditional way of preserving them is letting them dry out under the sun. This can give them a shelf life of at least one year.

Fun Fact:
Filipinos love pairing something sweet with something salty. An example of this is eating tuyo (salty, dried fish) with champorado (porridge with cocoa) for breakfast — a strange but surprisingly delicious combination!

This just in - you can visit Dubai on holiday WITHOUT eating grass for the month. Did you know airfares cost just $383 and 5-star hotels cost less than $200/night? 

That's even cheaper than a vacation to Tokyo! 

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/budget-dubaiDubai is dubbed the city of dreams for good reason, and here's how you can explore this captivating city for under S$1,000!","If you are there for a shopping spree, head down there just before hari raya. They usually have a massive sales on the already competitive retail pricing. e.g. 1 belt from armani exchange can cost as much as 140 SGD, over there its just slightly over 80 SGD factoring in the exchange rate on an average day. 2 biggest mall, Dubai mall and mall of emirates. u can easily spend an entire day in each mall due to the massive landscape and plethora of shops. 

Point 7, if you are opting for the dune bashing, it is priced differently by the location and experience. I went for the more expensive package and its worth every penny. Dont scrimp on this and short change urself on the experience when u have endure a grueling 7+ hrs flight to there. 

Burj Khalifa is too beautiful to give it a miss. Book and reserve ur tickets online as it is often sold out. Its linked to the dubai mall and u can have ur shopping there. If u r interested, the aquarium is also in the mall. 

Weather is harsh and you will consume alot of water. Go grab the 10 liter pack to ur room and refill ur personal bottle from the 10 liter pack. Most hotels provide free maps for tourist in their lobby. Gold souk, spice souk and Dubai museum are within the walking distances from metro station. Dont take the taxi as not all their drivers are honest and being stranger to the place, they can take u for a roundabout ride with the meter rocketing and no one is the wiser.

One of the hotel I stayed before Avenue Hotel. Near to the metro for traveling and with plenty of brochures in their lobby for activities to embark on in dubai for tourist.$$Point 1: u can cut down ur cost by going for 3 stars hotel if u just need a place to crash for the night instead of having a luxury slp over. There are plenty of hotels to choose from and some of them even throw in the breakfast and WiFi into the package. Choose one that is within walking distance from the metro and u will have an easier time travelling around

Point 3: their metro is not like our mrt system and is abit confusing. They cluster a few stations into one zone. When u are buying ur ticket to board the metro, the fare is charged by zones instead of stations. Point to note, if u get a single zone ticket, u can travel to any stn within that zone for a trip. On the next trip, u can just top up this ticket and board the train to the next stn within the zone. But if you wanna travel to stns within other zones, u need to get a 2 zone ticket and this means additional costs. If I recall correctly, they have different charges for single zone or multiple zone ticket for travelling, so it might be wiser to look up more info on this when planning ur trip$$Ifah Majeed reading abt DXB and i got reminded of you!$$Angela Simon - this looks more fun.

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommended malaria pills for those travelling to Palawan.  We used mosquito repellent, instead, day and night.  It's more effective in combating diseases carried by mosquitoes, i.e. malaria, dengue, etc.  The repellent worked great!  We're back in the US for 2 1/2 weeks now and no problems (malaria incubation period is 2 weeks).$$We also visited Nalusuan and Hilutungan Islands...  these islands are off the coast of Cebu.

As part of the celebrations under the #VisitPhilippinesAGAIN2016 campaign, the Philippine Department of Tourism in the United Kingdom launched ""The Station Domination Series"" in one of London's busiest train stations, the Waterloo Rail Station.

Starting last 24 April 2016, the first ""Station Domination Series"" features a special immersion zone that gives commuters a feel of the Philippines' beauty and promise of an overall fun experience when they travel to the Philippines. The launch also coincided with one of UK's most anticipated events, the London Marathon 2016.

The ""Station Domination Series"" also gives commuters a chance to win instant prizes and a holiday to the Philippines in three fun ways. One is by taking “foot selfies” using our floor stickers mapped around the station concourse, second is by taking part in the 3D selfie stand, and third is by experiencing the Philippine islands through a 360 virtual reality pods with photos by photographer Rommel C. Bundalian. 

Apart from the experiential zone, the campaign also features a month-long Philippine branding presence on Europe's largest LED screen found also at the Waterloo Station.

This activation campaign will run until 23 May 2016! Got friends and relatives in the UK? Tag them now! ","This is a fantastic idea! Somehow those people can have a vision how it will be when visiting our country!!$$Spent a lot of time out in Philippines and I can honestly say it's a beautiful country and lovely people too.

4622,225524117535380_1244471992307249,"[New] 13 Weird Things I've Learned About Singapore After Living Here For A Month

We were raised to drink our Kopi out of plastic bags; and call every Tom, Dick, and Harry 'Uncle' and 'Auntie' without batting an eyelid; but here are 13 oddities of Singapore life as seen through the eyes of a foreigner.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/living-in-singaporeFrom drinking out of a plastic bag, to generally despising the hot weather: these are some of the weird things that Singaporeans do which us foreigners wouldn't expect!","I moved from the UK to Singapore about 2 months ago. I can relate to most of these, especially point 4!!!$$Very interesting article which I can relate to as my wife is originally from Singapore. However let's not forget about the massive amount of plastic pollution that comes with all the food and drink packaging, as well as plastic bags used. We go back to what I call my second home a lot, and each time we notice the continual disregard for disposal packaging / plastic bags used at food & drink outlets and supermarkets. In this modern day and age we should be more environmentally conscience, and using more decompostable/biodegradable packaging should be the norm! I know this mainly comes down to government policies. Moreover the government does all the recycling for residents; people don't participate in their own waste management thus they do not see the importance of sorting out their rubbish and recycling, unlike countries in Europe and even Japan who are really good with residential recycling. Everyone needs to do their part in helping to reduce land waste as it's one of the most serious threats to our planet. Besides that, Singapore is still a great country to visit.$$I went the other way around ... relocated from Singapore to London last year. It's the same way ...So many things I miss about home, and so many cultural nuances to learn!$$Not just Singapore, in Malaysia it's exactly the same as well. I'm originally from Malaysian and currently studying in Edinburgh and I'm very surprised I've never seen ants and cockroaches here before... which is really odd$$It is good that the foreigners are mixing enough with the locals to even notice these differences. It used to be that ""expats"" kept very much in their own circle of friends, culture n habits, that by the time they leave they hv not much clue about the way of life of the country they had lived in for a while. I had a foreigner friend who thought she was going for a scary adventure when she visited the ""heartland"" and hoped none of her friends saw her doing it. And eating out of plastics,...you got to be kidding.$$Love this. ... thanks for posting. ... we are true blue  Singaporeans. .. !!
'Hot to death.  Hate the sun!'
Can  lah. .cannot. .can  can. .
Auntie. ......
I do get made when someone  calls me Auntie. .hahahahaha$$Used to be banana leaves and condensed milk tins with raffia tied in a loop through the lid.$$Put the maid up in the broom closet and then say she's treated ""like one of the family.""  

Nice family.$$Point 3. The kids go to communal areas to play, and the dogs just poo on their walks or get brought out to poo i suppose!$$That drink they will hang it every where.. I luv SG. Been there for 12 yrs.. Nice food. Nice country.. Nice people... Full of fun.. Best foods.. Everything...$$Lol!  Yes, I have already shopped for CNY decoration and will take down Xmas deco after Jan 1 & put up CNY deco.     2017 is roaster year 😊👍$$Yup.. its christmas but they already putting up decorations and advertisements for cny!$$Helen Tan Alan Tan hope u guys are good at point 5 by now..$$For number 3, some owners have pee trays at home for their pet to do their business$$Not forgetting the unique method of ""reserving""/ chiok your seat at hawker stalls with tissue paper packets.$$Joyce Jordan - do you remember we seen the locals eating ice cream sandwiches ? Xxxx$$Ive only being there once on holiday.one of the best places ive stayed in the world.
Defo will go back.its beautiful.$$Eating noodles from plastic bag is also normal... The HK snack life!$$Before the bags, we had the cans.$$Drinking out of a plastic bag😂 FFabrice Bkr$$Adeline, saw this and laughed my head off 🤣$$It's not weird...it's just Singapore...",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

https://zula.sg/singaporean-guys-cheated/","From my experiences most sg ladies are just playing hard to get. To them sincerity and a true heart ranks second to money and status. 

They are never satisfied with their other half. Constantly comparing their own partner with their friends's. When they see their girlfriends doing well and being constantly pampered by their bfs, they feel super envious and expect no less for themselves.

And when they realized that they could no longer feel good among their fellow girlfriends, they would have a change of heart easily. They could never take abit of hardship and would just ""abandon ship"" when storms come. In short they could never stand by their man. 

Materialism and hankering a life of pampering and comfort is the cause of it all. Its sad. For some of them they will always wonder why they always can't have / sustain a relationship but they would never look at the mirror and ask themselves :""So am I the cause and problem?""$$Basically these guys just go for the girls' looks mostly  so I think they deserve to get their hearts broken.  If they had really looked carefully and got to know the girls well, they would know who are the fakes and those who are really worth their time. So go figure.$$Really good hearted girls may not look like a million dollars all the time because most of them are busy earning their own salaries and taking care of their aged parents.  But once they get committed, they sacrifice their love, time and money nurturing that relationship. So those guys who only look for appearances   I still think they deserve the ""superficial"" girls that come with high maintenance and a truckload of  complaints ! :) haha$$The thing is a guy gets labelled an asshole when he cheats. But girls are always let off. Somehow even being defended by her friends and male friends also with reasons saying she had a reason to cheat. Puikkkk. Cheaters are disgusting.

The streets & rivers were narrowed down. Trees were hugely reduced because of population and over developments. If Manila structures base their building designs like of the era gone by, Manila could have a distinct character for foreigners and locals alike to marvel.

Model: Alicia Teng ","Update: As of 27th June, Fish & Chicks has a new outlet in the basement of Cineleisure. YAY!!$$i get that it is nice, but fish skins, burgers, fish and chips, crabs, come on la.... there are nicer things to eat right. lol$$Tried it recently. Not worth the hype. Can't really taste the salted egg nor the chilli crab. As good as eating the normal fish and chips.$$The worst fish & chips I have ever tasted. Waited for 3hrs, fish over cooked & zero salted egg taste. Not worth for money & time.$$Went over at 6pm on Friday. No Q. Ordered for 2 pax. Even clarified with the staff whether it was only that 1 plastic bag to take away. Reached home, zero sides. Gravy too sweet, batter tasteless. Didn't go back to change as we don't live nearby and we had a sick baby to look after. As a food establishment that allows and handles tabaos.. We felt cheated of our 4 sides.$$Please do not waste your time with this store. 

The salted egg had no inkling of salted egg in it. It tasted like some mashed potato sauce. 

The Chili crab tasted like Chili crab, but slightly diluted. It did not go well with fish and chips at all. 

Garlic rice was nothing special. Just oily rice with a hint of garlic. Tom yum rice is a disaster and can't even be called Tom yum rice. 

Herb infused fish, tastes like sour, salty fish. 

I am not being harsh, but the food they sell isn't worth travelling to experience. It's below mediocre and I'd rather opt for the kopitiam food below my house.$$Went at 925pm and they were already closed. Chefs were still cooking and the counter still had the 15min waiting time board on. Counter staff rudely told us ""sorry we are closed"" while closing cash register and not having any eye contact. Oh wells. 

We went over to Murphys a few feet away and im Glad we didn't dine at Fish & Chicks.$$BengBeng Lim is this what u talking about.. Not prata lah. Is fish n chips$$Wonder if there is a salted egg prata shop in singapore🤔🤔🤔$$Went to the place but didn't like the fish and chips. Ate them both. But chicken chop was good. Bad intro.

How to Get There:

What is it?
In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

What is it? 
The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) is the premiere showcase of the arts in the country. Founded in 1969 under the Marcos regime, it still continues to hold the most celebrated and award-winning plays from around the world. At night, it's therapeutic to watch the fountain lightshow — a colorful oasis by the side of the main road, in the middle of a busy metro.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
In the main lobby of the National Theater, you'll notice three large Capiz-shell chandeliers hanging from the third-floor ceiling. They symbolize the three main geographical divisions of the Philippines — Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

Great taste and many health benefits in short!$$Coconut water is a great alternative to sports drink to stay well hydrated  after a workout!! It's low in calories, naturally fat- and cholesterol free and contains super high in potassium are just some of the many wonderful benefits it provides. What's more, it has a clean tasting, naturally sweet, nutty and refreshing taste makes it even more super duper delicious!! Unlike some other brands out there, UFC coconut water is only sourced from fresh and natural young coconuts from Thailand, under the strictest quality to ensure the consumers receive the finest product!! 

That aside, I really hope to win to win the coconut water as I recently started working out (that's was one of my 2016 resolution) and since discovering the amazing benefits of coconut water, I've never ever am touching those sugary sports drink again!! The down side if I must say is that coconut water cost anywhere 1.5X to 2X more than sports drink, and winning them would help me save a bit!! HAHAHAHA All the best$$I would like to win a carton of UFC Coconut water because I often drink coconut water because of its nutritional properties. It contains all the essential electrolytes and helps hydrate the body efficiently which results in little to no muscle cramps during my training.

The only hill station in Rajasthan, Mount Abu is both a popular hill resort as well as a place of pilgrimage since the famous Dilwara Jain temples are located here. It is a pleasant green oasis of lush forested hills set in the barren desert scape of Rajasthan. 

Mount Abu is situated at the southern tip of the Aravali range, the hill retreat owes its cool climate to its rich flora covering the entire hillside that includes coniferous trees and flowering shrubs. During the period of the Maharajas, it was used as a place of leisure by the royalties. The place presents an interesting contrast of British style bungalows and holiday lodges with various tribal communities residing amidst the thick lush forest on the hills surrounding the region.

I should, I suppose: my fiancée is from the Manila area) and it's a country that grips you and never lets go. Granted: NAIA will first deter you. Granted: you will get a culture shock from the utmost mayhem that ensues once you leave terminal 1 but once you're past those hurdles you're in for an experience. First of all: the people.  They speak good English, always have time for a smile and a chat and are generally very helpful.  Second:  the environment.  Don't be deterred by the urban jungle known more commonly as Manila but venture out to the islands.  I definitely developped a soft spot for Palawan and Siargao.  Accommodation:  like any county it knows the good, the bad and the ugly but usually the prices are reasonably (particularly when compared to anything we have here in Western Europe) and the service (this is definitely something I have come to love about the Philippines) is excellent.

Ha ha.$$I didn't have to travel to 30+ countries to figure out that the Philippines is the best😉$$He mean that Phillippines  is the most beautiful over 30 countries he visited is becuz of the culture and the hospitality of co filipino's, most of all the mother nature$$It was written once the country is liked by GOD he will let whole world know about it, many more like him will mention so much adoration about Philippines until all will agree this country is heaven on earth. Not just our economy (property) cinderalla story, or our military advancement , or our people excellent work (BPO/medical care nurses most liked service, Engineers, Professional and many more) and our unparalleled warm attitude towards foreigeners. Even in competition GOD already shown many times in different categories oN how He favored us to win the 3 top post. Another story Arab country from Dubai company Kampac Oil Group believe its worth it to fund $15 billion worth for railway system Manila to Pangasinan as they knew our economy will grow 3 times more which will make us the leader in Asia that is excluding using our natural resources such natural gas worth $26.3 trillion in West Philippine Sea our rock formation China forcibly reclaimed now a man made island, our rich deposits like palladium the south if not same amount as Russia next to them. How about our unlimited hydrogen fuel in short what ever the world need we have it. Imagine if Philippines will have the access back to thousand tons of gold bars then the country will become superior. These are just small part of signs and wonders one by one taking shape revealing. The more we love GOD the more blessing will come to our shore. Only those who chooses to be blind will not see all this thing from happening simultaneously. GOD wants to show to the world Philippines will be the center of Faith, easy sample is the concerts audience is all facing center stage see our geographic location. If anyone still think NOT true be our guest as Philippines will start showcasing to the world.$$Thanks Alex Sherack for openly sharing your thoughts on how ""BEAUTIFUL"" our beloved Philippines is! You're absolutely right... Our country is the ""MOST BEAUTIFUL""... Walang katulad, walang kawangis!! God bless the Philippines.$$Indeed our country, the Philippines is beautiful! It's just sad to think that our government is making it less appealing to the world.$$Having travelled to most of the world, I only recently holidayed in the Philippines.

So let us all try our best to let the tourists feel our hospitality- Filipino style and let them all feel the goodness of Filipinos. There are still other destinations that need government support in development.$$I'm an Aussie happily married to a beautiful Filipina been many times and wanted to retire there but sadly what hurts the Philippines and turned me off was the total corruption of small time government officials who wanted their fees under the table before I could get me permanent citizenship including one of my wife's distant relative but the people "" The normal citizens "" of the Philippines are the magnets to go back I don't go to the tourist spots I love living the life of the locals in Ilagan Isabella also the pollution is a big turn off but slightly acceptable$$It's a good place to visit. Especially the islands outside Luzon. 

But if you wish to move here, live in the provinces. Metro Manila is sooo bad ... maybe except Makati or Bonifacio Global city.$$Really true because another German  which stay in our neighbour house is hook up to Philippines  until now.

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one 😂😂 damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london 😍😍 my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it 😂$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin – Singapore’s 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy! It's the most unforgettable dining moment.$$There's this place where you pick what food you want, and it get delivered to you like a speed train on a conveyor belt after the chef has finished your order.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Taal Lake, Batangas

What is it like? 
Since 1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. The most recent large eruption was on this day back in 1965.  Although considered active, this small volcano has been quiet over the last few decades. As a matter of fact, now there are hiking tours and overnight camping packages on offer.

Fun Fact: 
Want to know what it's like to swim inside a volcano? You can in Crater Lake. It's said that the high sulfuric content has medicinal properties. Some people have even scuba dived here. But don't stay too long. The lake's water also has high concentrations of boron, magnesium, aluminum and sodium in salt form.

I forgot the name if the restaurant .$$I've been here once. Beautiful place. Magnificent but what disappointed/angered me was that this place had so many horses! Some of them were malnourished and asked to carry heavt tourists up.. they were so skinny and some were so sickly. Please travel by foot if you ever go up this volcano. We travelled by foot and it was the most satisfying feeling in the world at its peak.$$Md Mehdi Hasanzz Please refrain from posting ads here to avoid being banned. Thank you.$$Yes! This is a great place to take your family for a weekend getaway. I can't wait to visit here again with my husband!$$A big misconception is that many people believe that Taal Volcano is part of Tagaytay City. It's not! It just happened that Tagaytay is one of the highest point in the area where you can have a perfect view of the volcano and lake.

Tagaytay City however is where one can view both of them. Because of the cool weather and relative cleanliness of this city, it has became the most popular tourist location. It offers comfortable place for busy Manila dwellers. 
Sadly however, development is taking its toll in Tagaytay. Condominiums rise up and threaten its natural scenic beauty. As a resident of Tagaytay, we hope the local government exercise better Urban Planning than other cities. We expect that more roads are built before the traffic becomes more serious as it currently is.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tubbataha Reef is the mecca of Philippine diving, and a superstar in the international diving scene. It's accessible only by live-aboard dive boats between the months of March and June. You have the chance to marvel at 11 species of sharks, over 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 12 kinds of whales and dolphins, and get this — 10,000 hectares of reefs.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

Fun Fact:
Aside from being a marine sanctuary, Tubbataha is also renowned for being a bird sanctuary. A lighthouse islet, at the southern tip of the South Atoll, supports a large number of seabirds which nest there.

this is totally the camera for me. I've been eyeing a flip screen camera for so long. with this camera, there will no longer be failed selfies, cutting off faces or wrong positioning. IT WILL ALWAYS BE PICTURE PERFECT <3

thank you TheSmartLocal for sharing this awesome post! love your other food and travel posts as well.$$Taking photos is what I usually do during the weekends when I'm out of camp. Dedicating photos to Instagram (@jonaskohh) and my personal blog (glimpsedthrough.blogspot.com), it can be a little troublesome to bring DSLR out and therefore Panasonic Lumix GF7 will solve the problem of bringing a bulky camera out during the weekends.

With the ability to pinpoint a subject with a touch of the screen and let the camera determine the correct focus and exposure, it definitely helps to take great Instagram photos or even photos to be uploaded onto my blog! 

With a build in wifi and providing easy connection, I can easily transfer photos from the camera to my phone and with that, I can upload them to Instagram right away! 

Apart from taking photos of still life, I will also take photos with my friends and with a 180 degrees tiltable monitor, selfies will definitely be a breeze!$$Dear TheSmartLocal.com!

I would like to own this cool Panasonic Singapore newest camera, Lumix GF7! Why? Reason is that simple!

Firstly, I love photography and it can be stress to take a nice photograph without a good camera that can focus my object well or the setting of the exposure can take sometime to adjust to the correct setting especially in our sunny Singapore!

With Lumix GF7, it can solve this problem for me! I simply need to pinpoint a subject which I want to capture by simply touch the screen and the camera will determine the correct focus and exposure or I just tap to take a photo without need to adjust anything!

What I like about this Lumix GF7 is that, I could wefie with my friend by selecting Selfie function! This camera in build 180 degree tiltable monitor where I can take photo with my best buddy by choosing Buddy Shutter or Face shutter! I think we will prefer the face shutter where we just need to cover our face with a waving hand to capture the photo!

Not to forget the coolest function will be Easy Wi-Fi!! Why? I can simply connect the camera or any of the smartphone or tablet and I can start sharing the photo images to my friend instantly and we could post to Instagram or Facebook immediately!

I will really love to own this camera!! :)

Hope that I can win the Lumix GF7 so that I can bring my Instagram photos (@raphaelhugh) to the next level! Won't need to rely solely on the iPhone 6 any longer haha. Thanks!$$I definitely would love to be the winner of the new Panasonic LUMIX GF7! 

Here are my reasons why (5 reasons in total...does this increase my chances?): 

1) it takes WONDERFUL photos in bad lighting (when I did my research I was pretty amazed by the photos that it was able to capture in different lighting conditions)

2) Wi-Fi connectivity!!! Say goodbye to the traditional and painful way of uploading photos on to Facebook/Instagram. In addition, it always takes pretty long for the photos to appear on fb due to laziness (we have been all there, haven't we?) Now, with wi-fi I can immediately share all my photos to Facebook and Instagram! What a dream! 😍

3) HIGH QUALITY SELFIE FUNCTION WITH AN 180 LCD TILT SCREEN PLUS BEAUTY FUNCTIONS!!!! MUST I SAY MORE?????? 

4) Interchangeable lenses *.* *.*

5) Did I mention that it LOOKS and FEELS incredible? Seek, classy and light. Just what I need. 

Best. Fashion. Accessory. Ever.$$1 Key function: 180° Tiltable Monitor for Selfie with Face Shutter & Buddy Shutter

Pardon the cheesy line, it's love at first sight! 😍 Really in love with its chic and stylish look which is like a classic camera. It will be the perfect companion on my cafe hopping adventures and my brother's (Weihong Peh) hunt for elusive places (which is the reason why I click on this post). Read reviews that it's easy to use (so not as intimating as a DSLR for an amateur photographer like me) but powerful. It's able to capture shots & colours under low lights, which is essential on my food hunts. Plus, I can now easily take selfies and wefies and upload it quickly with its inbuilt beauty and Wifi functions (yeah!). Most importantly, it's light! I can take LUMIX GF7 with me wherever I go and take shots single handedly. Awesome! 

I have trips with family and friends up coming. Will be perfect to have LUMIX GF7 with us to capture these memorable moments. Thank you @TheSmartLocal.com  for sharing this post and giveaway! Will really really love to win and own @Panasonic Singapore LUMIX GF7 please.$$Liked & Shared! <3 
Definitely the NO WIFI password Connection to share beautiful photos instantly from the camera to my Iphone! Instagram worthy photos hurray! Pls let me win, this will be my first selfie and wifi camera for my coming trip! Thank you TheSmartLocal.com & Panasonic for the chance! 😊$$Built-in WiFi with Easy Connection its so convenient to upload photo onto instagram !$$Hello! I'd love to win this camera for a lot of reasons but I'll just state one key reason as requested. 

The WIFI connection! 
Just because it makes things so easy, especially for someone lazy like me! No longer have the excuse to procrastinate sharing the beautiful pictures taken with PANASONIC LUMIX GF7 (If I win).

Thanks!$$I love the 180 degrees Tiltable Monitor which would allow me to take photos together with family and friends :) In addition, the Built-In WiFi would enable me to post photos on facebook and instagram without going through the trouble of transferring the photos onto my computer or phone first. Winning this camera would allow me to finally seriously pursue my interest in photography, which was always deterred by my lack of funds to purchase a quality camera or phone :( Thanks to TheSmartLocal.com and Panasonic Singapore for providing such an opportunity :)$$It has a motion activated shutter, 16 megapixels with the wide angle lens kit and even built-in wifi with easy connection! I'll be going on a school trip to Hong Kong in two weeks for 5 days and to the Philippines for a little more than a week shortly after that, and I'd love to document my trips without the hassle of having to film with my dslr which would be heavier and less compact. Would totally love to win this!$$Panasonic Lumix GF7 Camera has this very special and important function for a very Singaporean like me, the 180degrees Tiltable Monitor for Selfie!!!!!!!!! 
Everywhere must take selfie right hahaha 😂 with the built in wifi, can easily upload to Instagram/Facebook for a very kiasu me hehe 💖$$I can transfer the high-quality photos straight to my phone and INSTAGRAM THE YUMMY FOOD AND PRETTY SCENERY!!!!!! :D with the dual shutter button, i can now stand on the right side while taking selfie w my friends!!! :D$$Lightweight camera that produces quality photos, along with wifi function that allows me to share all my instagram worthy photos, and of course, more selfie time with the 180 degree tiltable screen!$$3 inch tilting touch screen, 22 filters and built in wifi!!! Perfect for selfie and out door shoot with instant updates to phone and social medias!!!! 16 megapixel, full HD video and weighing at 266g with batt and memory card? Omg!!! What else can you ask for? Awesome camera for everyone!!👍☺️$$My favourite function is the wifi function which allows me to upload my photos instantly to instagram! Best for instagrammer like me plus the quality is much much better than a phone. Hehe i would like to have this to take nice shots! Thank you :)$$No password wifi connectivity - great for sharing photos on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, blogs and even more social media sites in an instance.$$One function of the Panasonic LUMIX GF7 I like the most would be that it has Buddy / Face Shutter that allows users to take selfies with simple gestures such as bringing faces together or just a wave of your hand! It's such an interesting design to the selfie experience! grin emoticonnnnnnnnnnnnn :) :) <3",0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The same or similar activities will be held in all the ASEAN countries, which will lead to improvement of the environmental and economic situation in the ASEAN countries and the Commonwealth of GDP growth.
First.
Quote: ""In the Philippines, for the year on average, there is more than 35 earthquakes (on average by 3 earthquakes per month) magnitude of 5.0 - 5.9, one earthquake of magnitude 6.0 - 6.9 or 7.0 - 7.9, then this country can be considered one of the most seismically active areas in the world. ""
Philippines - a country of many mountain formations. Mountain formation, adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates of thousands of years are in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. Take two bricks to hold them together metal strip, and will be heated. According to the law: solid body expands when heated, bricks expand and collapse. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists "". The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate slipped under another"" And such, and the smaller joints in the Philippines and around it - tens and hundreds.
Treatment. Cooling Philippine land and water in the surrounding seas. Terms reduce the amount of power and ground and underground earthquake and tsunami 7 years - 15% per year.
The second - the restoration of the water balance.
Within three months, it will be organized the production of crystal clear drinking water, and enriched with all kinds of trace elements, including iodine,
Drinking water in the first year will go to hospitals, schools, preschool centers of large cities and tourist centers, and then as the water production growth will fully satisfy the needs of the entire state.
Irrigation water will ensure the restoration of rivers and ground and underground reservoirs in the level and purity. This will increase the productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, increase in agricultural and meat dairy products), and the cultivation of new forests arrays. You will be met and many other works.
Conclusion.
Such proposals Philippines will not get from anyone, and all the disasters will increase and the number and power, and destroy the economy.
Visas in the Philippines nor I, nor the managers are not needed. Better to call me as a specialist for three months. During that time I, or one of the managers of our bearings, and someone left who - no, but a visa is not the main thing.

Clark, Pampanga

What is it? 
It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

How to get there: 
Fly into Clark from Incheon, Singapore, or Hong Kong.

Or take a bus from Pasay or Cubao.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

Anilao, Batangas

What is it like? 
The town of Anilao may not have white sand beaches, but its underwater environment is its biggest attraction. Dubbed as the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines, its deep waters teem with marine life and an abundance of corals and reefs. For non-divers – the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

Fun Fact: 
Diving conditions in Anilao are ideal for divers of all experience levels. The water temperature is consistently warm, and the surface is typically calm and smooth throughout the year.

The only place in Seoul that I felt a little unsafer was Itaewon at night but that place doesn't feel much like Korea anyway$$Yes..it's true...i'm travel by myself between Anguk to Itaewon and plus sightseeing in Myeondong and end up in night market in Insadong..it's nothing bad happen..even i'm back to my hotel at 2am!!..$$And if you ever need to use a cellphone, Koreans are very kind about letting you use theirs.$$I feel safe but only worried about Language Barrier.$$The only places not safe are the sidewalks where the motorbikes will run you over...and at the pedestrian crossing where Korean drivers ignore the traffic lights. Night and day.$$I agree to Ow Wee Yang. It's all bout the language barrier. XD But I'm willing to learn the korean language / hangul$$no worry, Korea is very SAFE country  ^o^$$But why not easy to fly go to the korea frm hongkong. $$for me, korea is safe place to travel alone. no need to worry about language barrier since we can communicate with sign language.i try it many time and so much fun^^and many of them can speak english especially in seoul.$$We've lived in Korea for 2 years now with two small children, and have been ALL over the place.

The Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary & National Park is situated at the tri-junction of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka on the North Eastern Slopes of the Nilgiris. An erstwhile game reserve, Mudumalai was declared a wildlife sanctuary in the early 1940 by the then Madras Presidency.

With Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Karnataka) in the north, and Wynad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala) in the west the region forms a single, continuous viable habitat for a varied range of wildlife and is a part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. While Mudumalai’s western half receives the southwest monsoon, the eastern tracts receive the relatively gentler north-east monsoon which results in a diversity of vegetation and typical migration of herbivores.

It is located halfway through Panglao along its coast facing the Bohol Sea. It is a sprawling property which covers 16 hectares. The topography of the resort is diverse. It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

Sanchi’s stupas, monasteries, temples and pillars dating from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The most famous of these monuments, Stupa 1, known as the Great Stupa, was originally built by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, the then governor of Ujjayini, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant from the adjacent town of Vidisha. Their son Mahindra and daughter Sanghamitra were born in Ujjayini and sent to Sri Lanka, where they converted to king, the queen and their people to Buddhism.

The Sanchi hill goes up in shelves with Stupa 2 situated on a lower shelf, Stupa 1, Stupa 3, the 5th century Gupta Temple No.17 and the 7th century temple No. 18 are on the intermediate shelf and a later monastery is on the crowning shelf. The balustrade surrounding Stupa 2, carved with aniconic representations of the Buddha, was added in the late 2nd century BC under the Satavahanas.

The adjacent Gupta temple no.17 was hailed by Sir John Marshall as one of the most rationally organized structures in Indian architecture. Though small, it was a herald of all the principles which went into the engineering of an Indian temple in the early medieval period. The Buddhas in the perambulatory surrounding Stupa 1 are not contemporary with the Stupa but belong to the Gupta period in the mid-5th century AD. The monastery and the temple with the tall pillars adjacent to Stupa 1 and the temple near the monastery on the crowning shelf illustrate the evolution of the architectural form after the 5th century Gupta temple.

Please PM us your Full Name, IC number, and HP number, and we'll get back you on how to collect your prize.$$1) I will always take away my uneaten food at a restaurant, no matter how fancy. Great for lunch the next day!
2) bring my own Tupperware if I know I'm gg to buy food back for lunch in office etc 
3) reduce use of plastic bags by not asking for/returning plastic bags at places like bubble tea shops. Also bring my own bag when I go marketing. Drives the stall holders crazy but I have significantly reduced my plastic bag consumption 
4) use newspaper to pick up dogs poo instead of plastic bags. 100% biodegradable!
5) recycle every paper made carton or plastic container that comes through my house$$1. Don't use paper tissues. A cloth handkerchief is evergreen and very useful.
2. Invest in a cloth Tote bag and carry it to the supermarket. Say no to plastic bags.
3. Recycle properly and segregate your waste properly.
4. Don't waste water and instruct your house help to turn off taps when not using. Install low capacity showers n cisterns at home. Don't overwater plants in your garden and use water left from washing Vegetables to water plants.
5. Don't print unnecessary documents. Use e- tickets, e- receipts etc. Ask your bank to send you email statements. Same for utility bills, mobile bills etc. 
6. Donate old clothes, books, bags etc. 
7. Don't waste food. Leftover veggies and meat can be used as stuffing for sandwiches or rolls. Cook/order only how much you can eat.
8. Try and use reusable utensils, bottles etc.
9. Carry a plastic bag in your handbag always. Use it to carry stuff during emergencies or impulse shopping or your umbrella. Dry it and use it again. I see people wasting a lot of plastic bags for their umbrellas at work or in malls.
 That's all from me folks 😊$$Firstly, watch this video to feel inspired: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDQcBQUDpw It has to begin with a lifestyle change. Fret not, baby steps!                                           1) Just like the Meghan Trainer song, say ""NO"" to things like straws in your drink, plastic or paper bags at stores, and receipts                                                                  2) Make a grocery list when you go shopping to avoid buying impulse items                                                                                               3) Attempt buying 2nd hand clothes/bags instead of new ones (one man's trash is another man's treasure!                                            4) Buy detergent and dish soap in boxes instead of plastic bottles. Cardboard can be more easily recycled and made into more products than plastic                                                                                   5) Whenever possible, bring your own reusable container to dabao food or bring home your restaurant leftovers                                      6)Instead of buying juice in plastic bottles, make your own fresh-squeezed juice or simply eat fresh fruit. Not only does this cut down on plastic waste, but it's also better for you because you'll be getting more vitamins and antioxidants and less high fructose corn syrup:)       John Oliver said it best in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xwLWb0lLY, 1 earth, we got to do our part for it;)$$[W]ELL, you've got to challenge yourself to reduce food wastage today with the tips below! :)

[A]VOID cluttering the fridge, freezer and pantry. Pack things neatly and visibly, always move older products to the front so you consume them first.

[S]PLIT or SHARE the giant portion dish if eating out with friends so you don’t waste the large sized portions usually served in restaurants.

[T]HINK before shopping and cooking. Try shopping with a list with necessary food items on it and shop with meals in mind. Cook while thinking of making use of leftover food ensuring you eat everything you buy.

[E]XPIRATION dates suggest how long the product is likely to remain at its best quality when unopened, but it's not a safety date. Hence most foods like unopened item properly stored stay fresh past the “use-by” date. Don't throw these food immediately after the expiration date is due.$$I try to reduce wastage doing the following:
1) buy condiments in the smallest size possible, so there is a higher chance of using them up before expiry.  same with produce.  anyway, fresher is better
2) I try not to cook more than the amount that my family can consume. well, if they are not full after eating, just eat more fruits later on!
3) i freeze ripe fruits like grapes, strawberries, blueberries and bananas if i see that my family won't be finishing them any time soon
4) i use my own shopping bag instead of plastic bags.$$1. I always bring my own tupperware when I go out to eat! Used my own container for places like acai project (below!), cocowhip etc:)
2. I minimise the amount of packaging I consume by using my own bags when I go grocery shopping and by supporting eco products like a biodegradable toothbrush so that whatever I throw away can return to the earth! I also use handkerchiefs instead of tissue paper because every little bit counts, no?$$I didn't have frozen spring onion pancakes so I fried a roti prata in spring onion oil. 
I didn't have spicy bean paste so I used hoisin and chilli oil. 

Tadah: Easy Jian Bing 

1. Make it a point to just use whatever u have at home.
2. Scour the web for easy recipes that look good to u. 
3.Experiment with flavours.

Credit to thewoksoflife for inspiration$$When life gives you left overs from last night, make an aglio olio with everything on it :-) I also make omelets with left over potatoes and meat. Other than this, we segregate our trash at home and put them at the disposal bins below our apartment for recycling.  The food waste and other biodegradable items are put in a bin and are being used by the gardeners for the plants. Nothing is wasted in our apartment :-)$$Buy only what you will eat within the week so you dont waste food which expire or spoil easily.

Also, try to make takeaway boxes to lunch from overnight food. Eg, making fried rice from leftover rice and adding some ingredients.

Share your food if the portion is too big so there is no wastage! You can even use parts of food like the skin of fruits as fertilizer to your plants! <3$$1) I use the fibres leftover from juicing fruit juice as plant fertilisers n DIY face mask
2) Bring along a container to my canteen when buying food. It's also role modelling to the kids in my school.
3) Use leftover food and recreate another new dish the next day. For example I used leftover fried rice to make cheese baked rice!
4) Basically my rule of thumb is to try reusing everything more than once when possible. 

Maximise usage to minimise waste!$$1. When you have fresh vegetables in your fridge and you know you'll be eating out for the next few days (as Singaporeans do!) blanch them and store in a ziplock in the freezer for future use! Saves the veg from going bad, and saves cooking time for the next time you need to whip up a quick meal!

2. Use all vegetable scraps (carrot skins, celery bases, onion tops/bases, etc) to make your own homemade vegetable stock instead of throwing them away

3. Bring your own Tupperware when tabaoing food outside. It saves the use of plastic/styrofoam disposable boxes, and if you can't finish your food, you already have it stored in a Tupperware which you can keep in your fridge to finish up or repurpose into another meal later!$$Be Minimalist by 
1. Cultivate our mind & emotions.
2. Focus on the essentials - consume less but enjoy more.
3. Appreciate the art of making something. Eg: Hardwork of farming/cooking or sewing clothes/shoes.
4. Strive for better yet not marginalize others.$$Reduce food waste by:
1) buy only required quantity 
2) cook only portions that can be consumed
3) can't finish, put food in Tupperware and store in the fridge for following day's consumption 
4) share big quantity food  neighbors and friends 
5) avoid being too greedy when dine out and order too many food 
6) don't be kiasu and can't finish food taken during buffet time 
7) bear in mind many children are starving at less developed countries 
8) generous in food donations to needy families$$1. Cook only the amount you and your family are able to eat, the remain ingredient could keep to use tmr. If there any part which not able to eat such as veg head/root. Feed to pet living in the house. If no pet, cut into smaller pieces and buried into your plant soil.

2. Left over food can either feed to dog or keep in a container into the fridge. 

3. If eat outside, ask for less rice or request small plate and share with other. 

4. If no appetite to eat anything, and u hungry, have a meal replacement instead, such as protein shake or cereal.$$My family is a coffee drinker and we brew fresh coffee every morning, instead of wasting the brewed coffee ground, we use it as plant fertilizer and DIY anti cellulite body scrub! And instead of throwing unused vegetables away, we use it to re-grow new plants and harvest new vegetables for the family to eat home grown organic vegetables. And instead of throwing peeled fruit skin, we use it to clean dishes (leftover lemon skin), Polish shoes (leftover banana skin), we also use orange skin as DIY room freshener (no chemical) and so many more! Here are my tips to live green to reduce waste ❤️$$1. Order about 5-10% less than what you think you will need 
2. Allocate leftovers for the next meal
3. Drink more water / eat more fibre related foods to fill more full easily$$We bought a steamboat stove with grill plate. Cook on spot what you want to eat, remaining can cook other dishes or make sandwich/salad/wrap for next day! 😉$$Buy in moderation and clear everything in the fridge before buying more... Keep lookout for clearance sales in Marts and have a budget in mind before shopping...$$Thanks TheSmartLocal.com for the generous giveaway! Some of my tips are:

1) Reuse/ recycle - e.g. used yakult bottles can be washed and be used as stationeries holders
2) Be kiasu - bring your own container/reusable bags when buying things
3) Go electronically - avoid/minimize printing of papers
4) Donate useful items to charitable organisations 
5) Compost food waste (my company is currently doing it!)
6) Pass on the list to others!

Hope to be one of the lucky winners! ^^$$Before the currency was invented, people trade. They trade livestocks, food for services, clothes for food, among others. And this is one of the ways we can reduce our waste. Instead of buying new clothes, we can trade our old clothes with our friends for some new or fresh styles. How about trading your old crib for some new toys for your kids? You can buy plenty of secondhand clothes and items online. They are cheaper and you are actually recycling too :-) We minimise the use of resources this way. Great way to go green!$$We minimize waste in our home by:

1) Segregating our trash and putting them in the recycling bins.

2) Up-cycling glass bottles and plastic containers. We turned the old ice cream container into an art organizer for my kid and the oatmeal container into a toy jar. It's good to teach them young about the value of recycling. 

And of course, the glass bottle is turned into a vase and spice jars. I but my spices in bulk and use the old glass jars to store them in. 

3) Use cotton re-usable diapers instead of the disposable ones. I save a lot of money and I save the environment too because I reduce the amount of plastic being thrown out. Also, instead of using serviettes or kitchen papers, use a washable dish towel for wiping surfaces. 

4) To reduce energy wastage, we open the windows to let the sunshine and the air in so we don't have to turn on the lights or use the airconditioning all the time.

Every little bit helps. Joy Sung join :-)$$1) Shop smart during grocery shopping. We go to the supermarket three times a week, once during the weekends and twice during weekday nights and buy groceries for our cooking. This way, we will not ""overstock"".

2. When eating out, i will order for the family with two young girls but not myself. This way, I can finish up the leftover food. 

3. In the event of leftovers after a cooked meal, we will store them in the fridge, reheat the next day and packed them for lunch in the office

4. We store our food in correct places. Fruits which does not require refrigeration must be stored in a cool dry place to maximise their life span. 

5. Adopt FIFO concept when storing food in the fridge. Always consume the food you put in the fridge first. 

6. Buy pre loved toys for the children and hand them down to orher children. 

7. Bring your old bags when doing shopping$$If only there's some form of platform or app for people to share certain items and can buy together eg: I probably only need 100ml out of 300ml of soya sauce as I don't cook often, or 2kg out of 10kg rice etc, yet paying lesser. This will keep wastage to the minimum since you only buy what you need. By recycling the bottles or packaging you had used before, helps to keep wastage to the lowest too.$$After we have gotten our new home, we have to shop and manage our things wisely as all the things bought means $$ going out.
Towards a Zero Waste Challenge:
1) Research for recipes that we want to whip up and buy what we need instead of buying the ingredients first and think of what dishes to cook.
2) If we have unused food in fridge, we'll research for dishes that require them! 
E.g. We bought a packet of 5 salmon fillets, we've tried baking it and pan frying it! We'll always have packets of potatoes and carrots in our fridge as it's always easy to make a meal with roasted veggies! Whenever we bake fish/chicken, we can always pair it with roasted veggies. This helps us to ensure we eat healthily and we do not have too much unused food in the fridge!
3) If we bake a cake or make any desserts, we'll share them with our parents or friends so that they don't go bad in the fridge and our family and friends will also give us feedback to improve our desserts!
4) I'll always use the envelopes for my bills as rough paper. I do not have to search for foolscap or notepad!

About the zipline, this is a new venture so a lot of people don't know about it yet. You should definitely go with a backup map or contact information to show to taxi drivers when you go. 

The zipline tower is right on the far right end of Jumunjin Beach (when looking at the ocean). The beach is fairly well known so that should give the taxi driver an idea of where to go.

Taoist Temple, Cebu City

How to Get There:
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

What is it?
The Cebu Taoist Temple was built in 1972 by the Chinese community. Both worshipers and non-worshipers are welcome to visit and see the colorful statues and structures. 

Fun Fact:
While the rituals held in the temple are for devotees only, you can drop some coins at the wishing well for good fortune.

If you have friends who will travel to Hong Kong Island with a tight budget, please ask them to avoid dorms (9/8/7/6/4/3 bunk bed) that spread on a few floors in an apartment mansion (next to locals, they need to go to work in the morning). You might pay lots of money just to sleep on mattress on the floor (far over-priced and incredibly cramped). Hot water may run out 5 minutes after shower (small electric heater). You also need to pay for towels and flip-flops. The sum you pay may be more than an economy hotel. Besides, there’s no time saving as you need to wait for the washrooms with some travelers (e.g. 30 mins). You can see some good comments but it’s a ""trap"". If you see there're many beds available and choose to stay, you will be regretted. As I said before, it's a ""trap"". Beware. Search different website, compare and choose carefully.

http://visitph2015.com/ ","Where exactly in Quirino is     this festival?$$Sorry this message is a bit long winded .                                                                                                                           Quirino is one of those provinces in Luzon that’s still off the tourist radar. Formerly part of Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino became a separate province in 1966. While most provinces in the Philippines are known for something concrete, Quirino’s identity has yet to be formed. It was this air of mystery for an “off-the-beaten path” destination that made me more eager to visit the province. The province is still raw and rugged in terms of facilities, but has a lot to offer in terms of natural attractions and eco-adventures. Nature-tripping and camping, caving, spelunking, trekking, rafting and outdoor sports are just a few of the activities that you can do here. The Sierra Madre mountain range provides a natural barrier on the eastern and southern border of the province and the Mamparang Range on the western part. Right now, it’s only accessible by land from Isabela, but roads are currently being built that will link it to other provinces. There is no airport in Quirino Province. The nearest airport is located in Cauayan, Isabela, which is about 1.5 -2 hours away by land. Several Bus lines (Five Star & Northern Luzon Bus Line) ply the Manila-Quirino route daily while NA Liner and KMS ordinary / aircon ply the Baguio-Quirino route daily. Aircon buses also ply the Manila-Santiago (Isabela route). From the Santiago terminal, you can take a van or jeepney to the different towns: Diffun, Cabarroguis, Aglipay and Madela, from where you can transfer to Nagtipunan. If you’re in a big group, rugged vehicles like jeepneys are the best way to access the mountainous areas that are the jump off points for tourist sights. The rugged roads and dirt tracks in mountainous areas are actually great for Motocross riders and mountain bIkers. There are no private motorcycle or bicycle rentals available yet in Quirino, but some groups are planning to offer this in the near future to cater to tourists. There’s currently a wakeboarding park and hotel being constructed in town. Expected completion is March 2015. The Motocross Cup held every June, in celebration of the Governor’s birthday, draws in thousands of motocross enthusiasts from around the country. Governor’s Rapids, a tributary of the mighty Cagayan River, is famous for its limestone formations. According to locals, there’s a waterfall inside a cave that you can only reach by riding a boat here. A 37-chamber cave system ideal for spelunking, with 8 chambers developed for caving for enthusiasts of different levels of ability. About 80 percent of the total land area of Quirino is covered by mountains and highlands. We got to enjoy a great view of the countryside while toploading on a jeepney on our way to Nagtipunan. The town of Nagtipunan, where the Cagayan River cuts across, is ideal for camping and eco-tourism activities including rock climbing, trekking, swimming, boating, rafting, excursions and fishing, among others. Capitol Plaza Hotel & Restaurant in Cabarroguis, the capital of Quirino, offers comfortable rooms for business and leisure travelers. It’s the largest hotel in the province, has a decent restaurant and large swimming pool, making it popular for local events.

MPC Abrasa Hotel. Gundaway, Cabarrogquis, Quirino                                  There aren’t a lot of big restaurants in Quirino, but there are several eateries serving specialties of the Cagayan Valley region                              Ilokano cuisine seems very popular, including dishes like dinakdakan (an appetizer made of grilled pig’s parts blended with pig’s brain or mayonnaise) and igado (a meat dish made from strips of meat and other internal organs such as kidney, heart, and intestine).     One of the more unique food finds was Royal Tubikoy, a combination of tupig, bibibgka and tikoy. The native delicacy made of glutinous rice, coconut pulp, milk, sugar, cheese and shortening is produced by RNB Bukohan and Eatery, Aurora West, Diffun, Quirino. Contact no: 0926-5384956.                                                                 Fossilized flowers are Quirino’s one-town-one-product. While they look ilke dried flowers, fossilized flowers are actually made of alibangbang or butterfly leaves that have been dried, bleached and dyed. You can buy this in the Quirino Pasalubong Center right next to Capitol Plaza Hotel. There’s also a larger showroom and factory in town, where you can buy flowers in bulk. Other products that you can take home for souvenirs include wood carvings, indigenous handcrafted baskets and bags. Food items of interest include mountain rice, Tilanggit (tilapiang danggit), banana chips, polvoron, sampaloc candy, veggie kropek, veggie noodles, and native cakes.            Quirino has two seasons: wet & dry. According to tourism officials, the best time to visit is during the summer months. However, some activities, like caving, river rafting and trekking to waterfalls can be enjoyed all year around, even during the rainy season.

Quirino’s main festival is the Panagdadapun Festival held every September 8-10. The fiesta, which was first celebrated in 1999, showcases the province’s unique culture, convergence of people, and colorful history.
The Aquero Patronal Festival is celebrated every February 14th at the Nuestra Senora de Lourdes Parish, municipality of Aglipay.
Each town has their own respective festival as well.

The Simhastha Kumbh is an unrivalled celebration in India. The most popular legend regarding the origin of Kumbh Melas is the Samudra Manthan or 'churning of the ocean'. Gods and demons competed ¬ercely in the churning in search of the divine nectar of immortality. During this epic battle to capture the Urn (Kumbh) containing the nectar, drops of the precious liquid fell on four places – Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Nashik and Ujjain. Hence, river Kshipra became the enhancer of life and to celebrate this event since then the grand festival came in vogue. Kumbh Mela, is held once every twelve years at these four places and attracts millions of devotees.

Grand Simhastha, on the Ghats of the glorious Kshipra

The Ujjain Kumbh is celebrated when Jupiter ascends into sun sign Leo's quarter or the Simha constellation of zodiac, which is why it is called 'Simhastha'. The Simhastha is special in Ujjain as it is the seat of divine Mahakal - the Lord of all times. The ritual of bathing in the holy waters of Kshipra begins on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (March-April) and continues on various dates until the full moon shows up in the following month of Vaishakha.

Simhastha 2016 will begin on 22nd of April and will continue till 21st of May.

Sadhus of various sects from across the country assemble in Ujjain and mingle with ordinary people as they take their ritual dip in the holy waters of the Kshipra.!

Let us tell you the myth about this girl “Tatsuko” in the golden statue.
There was a girl, Tatsuko, in the area of Lake Tazawa. Everybody knew she was beautiful and attractive. One day when she realized she truly owns beauty, she started clinging to it. She did not want to lose neither her beauty nor the youth. She wanted them forever that she went to shrine to ask for a help. “Guanyin”(enlightenment being in Buddhism) suggested her to drink water of the lake as much as possible. She kept drinking with suffer, gradually, she turned into “tatsu” (dragon). Since then, she started living in the Lake. Her husband experienced the same thing in the northern lake. He, also in a dragon shape, came to Lake Tazawa, and they have lived together. Having two owners, Lake Tazawa got deeper and deeper.

How to Get There:
Fly into Puerto Princesa from Busuanga, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo or Manila. 

What is it?
The series of protruding limestone formations unique to Palawan make the province home to lakes as well. These lakes are formed when water is trapped in the spaces in between the limestone cliffs. 

Fun Fact:
A Palawan getaway wouldn’t be complete without limestone cliff diving. The otherworldly rock formations make a picturesque backdrop for jumpshot-off-the-cliff photos.

I had a first pair of GEOX years ago, it was so comfy, and i would love to win a new pair cos the old one was worn to bits :p I could see that a new pair of GEOX boots will keep me warm when i travel to cool climates!!! :)$$Subscribed, liked & shared! I always have trouble on what shoes shall I pack when I travel. Thanks to this post, I am sure going to get a Geox product regardless if I win the voucher or not. But with the voucher, it certainly allows the let me have more pairs!$$When creating a pair of shoes, it is often a struggle between form and function. Not many can strike that fine balance between form and function -- GEOX shoes stand out not only because they have mastered this balance, but they have upped the ante by adding comfort to its highest possible level. 

I have never owned a pair of GEOX before but I truly believe that GEOX lives up to its name as I have seen a pair of GEOX that has been with my friend for almost 10 years. I want to win this GEOX voucher so that I can have a chance to experience this kind of relationship with a shoe! And then influence another person to get GEOX! Thanks in advance for this opportunity!$$Subscribed, liked & shared. Nope, I'm not winning this for myself. I'd like to win this for my mother. She would be traveling to Japan next month and the climate there is said to be really cold. She has never seen snow in her 62 years of living and she intends to wear her track shoes there as she's a thrifty woman. Therefore I sincerely hope to win this voucher so that I can buy her a pair of winter boots to keep her feet warm when she travels to Japan next month. That's the least I could do as a daughter I suppose and not let her wear track shoes while walking in the snow (: happy 2016 to you guys anyway! Cheers*!$$I should win this because Chiang Mai is a lovely place and I'm singing its praises because I have been to this city, had memorable memories and would love to return again. With its breezy mountain weather, cheap food and many cultural places of interest. It's amazing and way better than Bangkok if you are more into the Arts and Cultural sort of person. I did participate in the festivals like Loi Krathong (floating the boat on water) and Lanna (floating lanterns), it's awe- inspiring. And I wish to return to experience the wonder sight of the Sakura blooming and check off my bucket list too!$$I would like to win this for a very special someone Samantha Lee. She is my fiancee. She likes to travel around the world with me. She can definitely have this pair of boots to walk the world with me. Really hope to win this for her.$$I have been travelling a lot and realised that having a good trusty pair of shoes for travel is very important. Many times I have to pack like a pair of sneakers, pumps, slippers etc into my luggage which takes up a lot of space and weight, not forgetting those bulky thick winter coats when travelling to cold countries. Geox is a trustable brand for its comfyness which is stylish, at the same time, to match with all types of outfits! With this pair of boots, I don't have to worry about packing so many shoes into my luggage anymore! Hope I can win this and own my first pair of Geox! 😊🙆$$I should win because I only wear GEOX's shoes after I have foot problems.  It's the only shoes that helps me walk like a normal person again!

I should win as I am a big fan of GEOX especially because of its  technological innovation and Italian style.

In Geox shoes and boots, a patented system consisting of a microporous membrane placed on top of a perforated rubber sole allows heat and humidity to escape from my feet, and keeps the shoes fresh and comfortable all day. :D Despite this enhanced breathability, many Geox shoes and boots remain waterproof and that's crucial living in Singapore where it can rain anytime anywhere! :)$$Liked & Shared!

What is it?
Club Paradise Resort is surrounded by a house reef which is easily accessible to divers and has a diverse marine system. Near this reef is the feeding ground of sea turtles and dugongs (sea cows) – the gentle giants of the sea. There are tours that take you along the coast of Busuanga for some dugong-watching.

How to get there? 
Fly into Puerto Princesa from Busuanga, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo or Manila. 

Fun Fact: 
Some believe that stories of mermaids came about when lonely sailors spotted dugongs swimming in the ocean, and mistook their shape as that of half-woman, half-fish creatures.

Working a job and trying to cook meals for my family is a trying task. It can be tougher  to be a working mom especially when you have a tough job or work long hours. So canned sardines are my favorite quick meals after a long day.  Sardines are packed with nutrients of every kind, and the canned fish are actually even better than the fresh, because with canned sardines, you’re eating the whole fish including the bones that are soft enough to eat, providing a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats in one tasty can!  My daughter loves tomato  sardines with melted cheese and broccoli.  My husband loves chili sardines with rice/noodles.  For me,  I prefer deep fried sardines with eggs &  toast = sardines french toast!  The ways of cooking is endless.  😁😁😁

Tarsiers of course and spectacular fireflies but I also saw sunbirds and a Philippine hawk owl where this photo was taken on the hotel veranda <3$$Para Sa Mga Nagdadalawang Isip Para Iboto Si Mayor Duterte please read this:

The attacks against Mayor Duterte is so intense. I've never seen such attacks against a frontrunner in the past 2 National Elections. With just few days left, these will even intensify. If you are a supporter and thinking of withdrawing your vote for Duterte because of his issues, brace yourselves and remember the reason why you supported Duterte in the first place. We've started from the bottom, now we're here. Change is coming. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future. This man has a huge sincere heart that I believe will benefit the country.

Maraming nagsasabi na ""if you want change, start in yourself at wag iasa sa magiging pangulo."" I agree, pero wag nating kaligtaan na marami ding mga tao na kahit kaya nilang simulan yung pagbabago sa sarili nila, kailangan padin nila ng isang tagapanguna na kaya silang tulungan na mangyari yung pagbabago na hindi lang sa sarili nila kundi sa kabuuan ng isang bansa. I believe that Duterte is the man.

Everytime he talks about his country and the change that he wants to bring, he is very sincere. Para siyang stand-up comedian bago magstart yung 2nd debate sa TV-5 (joking about Mar going to restroom and not knowing a single person from the audience), nakakatawa. He is known for his gutter language at offensive siya minsan. Sabi nga ng iba parang di siya nagiisip bago magsalita. But everytime he speaks about his love for the country and concern for his fellow Filipinos, he is very sincere. He has the most heartfelt messages. Sincerity makes the very least person to be of more value than the most talented ones.

He is also the candidate na hindi uhaw na uhaw na maging presidente. I believe it’s because his heart is really for the people and not for the position. He said many times that he will not die if he does not become a president. He said he will not apologize for who he is even if he lose the presidency.

While the other candidates in the last debate promoted themselves as the rightful president and expressed their confidence in winning the election, he simply said, “Wala akong hangarin except for my country. And I pray to God that the nation will be enlightened with His Grace, and you can choose the leader, bahala na kayo kung sino, the one who can make it happen.” Did you see that? Tayo na daw bahala. Di niya tayo pinipilit o pinapakiusapan na siya ang iboto. Also notice, his desire is for the country and his prayer is not for the people to be enlightened by his track record, leadership and platform (though those were really good), but be enlightened by God’s grace. He did not rely on himself and his achievements, he entrusted everything in the Grace of God.

I don’t want to sound like a priest but I hope that the religious leaders noticed it too. Only Duterte and Miriam mentioned in their closing speech that they are praying to God for the welfare of this nation. You see? Si Mayor Duterte, palamura, womanizer daw, corrupt daw, murderer daw, in other words makasalanan. But he is seeking God’s grace in this endeavour.

I’d rather support this “sinner” who depends on the grace of God than those religious leaders and self-righteous politicians who depend on themselves. I’d rather vote for someone na hindi “disente"" at hindi atat na manalo kaysa dun sa sumisigaw na siya ang mananalo. I will choose Duterte for his sincerity and desire to make sure that his fellowmen are safe and free from criminality, drugs, and corruption.

Sabi ng karamihan magdesisyon daw ayon sa character, moralidad, at kakayahan ng isang kandidato. Nope, ang desisyon ko ay base sa sinseridad at pagdepende ng kandidato sa biyaya ng Diyos. Because God’s grace can transform someone’s character and morality into better. But it cannot change a self-righteous person simply because they won’t even see the need for that Grace because they just depend on their own goodness.

Now, what if one day I realized that I supported the wrong person? Then be it. Life goes on. We just learn from it. In fact, we have been making bad decisions in electing Senators, VP and President in the past. Who knows this time, we’re making a good one. They say that a vote for Duterte is a high risk. Well, I'm taking the risk because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. I don’t really think that this 71 year old man would like to be remembered as a bad leader. I believe that he wants to leave a legacy that will change the course of this country.

It is apparent that there is a very strong opposition to stop the Davao City Mayor. But the greater the opposition, the greater the opportunity. An opportunity to stop the dominion of the elites and oligarchs. An opportunity to fight, suppress and stop drugs, crime and corruption. An opportunity to clean the government and the system. Change is coming. Lets DU it! Duterte for President!$$Yesterday's river cruise at Loboc, Bohol. 😍🇵🇭 EarLa Navarro$$Well known with its powdery white sandbar and crystal clear water.

""THE LEGEND SATAY SINCE 1952 AT BANDUNG""
West Java. Indonesia

Sate Kambing Hadori can be regarded as a living legend in the culinary specialties of Bandung that still exist today. So do not be surprised if this sate echo has echoed to the entire city of Bandung, even outside the city. So famous, to the extent that there is an anecdote that later developed in the community Bandung that if there are people named Hadori it will be then referred to as a handyman satay. Sate Kambing Hadori certainly have not name any names, but typical culinary symbol and at the same time struggle to exist.

Sate kambing is part of the cuisine of Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. It is very popular in the country, especially in Java. Sate kambing is the Indonesian name for mutton satay, since it is made of goat meat. This food is made by roasting goat meat that has been mixed with seasoning. A set of Sate Kambing usually consists of the satay itself, complemented by a sauce made of soya sauce or peanut sauce. Some people eat it with rice while others prefer to eat it with traditional rice box named lontong or ketupat. In some areas sate kambing is sold together with another popular food named gule kambing (goat soup). Sate can also be made by other meat e.g. meat of buffalo, chicken, fish, and others.

Clearly, if a culinary tour in the city of Bandung, do not miss to stop by the Sate Hadori

The exhibit runs until December 25th, but right now we don't think there will be any more K-pop stars making appearances. We'll let you know if anything changes, though!$$Winter in Korea occurred in the month of December to early March, now to enjoy the winter in Korea are some pretty interesting places to visit by us. Nami Island or also called Naminara Republic. Located in Bangha-ri, Namsan-myeon, Chuncheon-si originally not an island. This is the island Bukhangang River, which was made as a result of dam construction Cheongpyeong. Circumference is about 6km, and the area is 430,000. There grassplot than 260,000 in the middle of the island. Nami Island is a beautiful and interesting island to visit with family, friends or spouse during the spring and winter. Because in addition to having natural beauty, Nami itself has a sweet romance and memories when we visit there. And that is strengthened by the story of a love story of the drama 'winter sonata'.

You must already know the story korean drama ""Winter Sonata"" which players Bae Yong-jun, Choi Ji-woo and alm. Park Yong-Ha. Winter Sonata is a love story that is able to anesthetize the audience. The story of this drama is about love first has enormous power. Power is capable of uniting the two lovebirds even though many things have become hindrance of their relationship. Almost certainly you'll like the 2002 series is made in Korea. Besides interwoven stories that are packed very beautiful, background paronama winter is very captivating to watch. Nami Island in the drama is created, so Nami Island became world famous.

In addition to Nami Island, Winter in the city of Seoul is also quite interesting to enjoy. Because along the sidewalk in the winter, many vendors sell snacks winter is quite popular as roasted sweet potatoes, roasted chestnut, hoppang kind of steamed bread, and bungeo-ppang fish-shaped bread that is in filled with red bean paste. Although Korea has grown rapidly and is more modern, but traditional snacks are still there and not change and can bring us back to childhood for the ancient Korean society. Winter in Korea is very cold, windy and dry, so this is a nightmare for our skin. Do not forget when you come to Korea during the winter always apply moisturizer to the skin that are not easily dry and wrinkled. Hehehe ......

If a vacation in the winter, not afdol if not try the game skating on the ice at the Everland amusement park is popular in winter. Skiing and snowboarding are the most exciting games in the winter, because it's a lot of visitors who arrive in this Everland. In winter there are also several festivals are held to enliven the winter, like Taebaeksan Snow Festival. This festival is one of the most interesting festivals in the country and popular Korean ginseng and this wave. In addition, tourists can also enjoy a visit there and follow the race to form snow with a gift that was quite interesting. Kite festival in the winter is also quite interesting in Korea. Not to mention the concerts are held in this season, which presents K-pop that has been popular in the world, such as Super Junior, Shinee, Fx, SNSD, Beast, TVQX, Wonder Girl, Big Bang, 2NE1, T-ARA and other other. Well, how do you want to try a visit to the State which will terkanal ginseng, natural beauty, culture, and his K-POP in this winter ??.....C'mon guys visit in the korean.
The ski travel program includes daytime activities such as ski instruction, amateur ski competitions, snowboard competitions, and sledding competitions, while featuring some nighttime events like Korea traditional dance and modern performances. There are also a number of additional special events, discounts and free gifts for visitors.
In the recent years, the number of Southeast Asian tourists for the winter season has increased because of the snow covered mountains and the fun and thrills that are offered at the ski resorts in Korea.

It’s a ferry ride to Hong Kong Disneyland! Check out the details of Star Ferry's Water tour here: http://bit.ly/2kIZwO0$$This trip is amazing I did it on the 9 th Jan for my 60 th birthday with 6 other friends we did the lunch package which includes the boat crossing and lunch or afternoon tea at the Walt hotel , we went on the 11 am ferry and came back on the 6 pm ferry it takes about an hour each way but there is a bar on board and your ticket includes a drink and snack the trip back is lovely as it dark and you see Hong Kong in its glory , the meal at salts hotel  was very nice and they also made me an amazing birthday cake , you also get access to the Disney transport so we went and had a look around all the hotels ,the cost was approx £40 per person including lunch but just the round trip is about £20 , we were lucky enough to be treated like royalty on the boat as we were the only 7 people on it going out and on the way back there were 4 more people but they were tour guides . Worth doing for a special occasion$$I was in HK a few years back, been  on the star ferry but did not know there was a disney land ?? Is it recent?$$Once in a lifetime experienced Jan 28, 2017 ... its Chinese New Year... from Macau to Hong Kong... and its raining hard when we get there... oh oldies like us can't enjoy the Disney land any more just picture pictures only... happy enough at the gate rather than to pay that much anyway its raining you cant do much walking too inside... do other options back to the malls and do some window shoppings.... happy enough  :-)$$Took my 4 kids here whilst on a busman's holiday 2 years ago, and they loved it, the ferry was great.

a baby
girl named Marry. Her mother couldn't
take
all the
crying, so she decided it was time for her
to
go. She
buried her baby alive in her back yard.
After she
buried her she could still hear Marry
crying.
So she dug her back up and stabbed her
one
time in the arm,
and buried her again. Marry cried harder,
but a few
hours later it stopped. At exactly 12:42,
Marry died.
She bleed to death. Now her sprite
haunts
the
world. When your sleeping, she stabs
you in
the
arm and watches you bleed to death.
And
that's how she got the name ""Bloody
Marry"" this is the true story
of her. She wants everyone to feel her

Batanes, Luzon

What is it like? 
The ten islands of Batanes are among the northernmost places in the Philippines. They have very unique topography, where green pastures merge with a contrasting white shoreline. Chadpidan Beach, Sabtang Beach and Nakabuang Beach are the most popular ones.

Fun Fact: 
The islands lie in a strait between the Philippines and Taiwan. Turn on a transistor radio and you'll pick up signals from Taiwanese radio stations!

6375,67558139928_10153554682914929,"Batik is a technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to whole cloth, or cloth made using this technique. The word of batik is derived from the word “ambatik” which means “a cloth with little dots”. The suffix “tik” means “little dot, drop, point or to make dots”. Batik may also originate from the Javanese word “tritik” which describes a resist process for dying where the patterns are reserved on the textiles by tying and sewing areas prior to dying, similar to tie dye techniques. Another Javanese phase for the mystical experience of making batik is “mbatik manah” which means ”drawing a batik design on the earth”.

Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting or by printing resist with a copper stamp called a cap. The applied wax itself resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to color selectively by soaking the cloth in the one color, removing the wax with boiling water and repeating the process if multiple colors are desired.

Batik which made in the island of Java has a long history of acculturation, with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures, and is the most developed in terms of pattern, technique and the quality of workmanship. On October 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian Batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. http://ow.ly/RydRE

What is it like? 
Makati City is one of the most urban cities in the Philippines, filled with tall office buildings, shopping centers, and entertainment hubs. There’s no place for boredom here. You’ll always find it bustling with lights, sounds, and conversations.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Fun Fact: 
The city is actually a location for a world record: The Guinness World Record for the Biggest Fashion Show. Over 2,000 professional and amateur models walked down runways sporting designs from the best of the country’s fashion brands.

Our Ayala Center in Cebu Business Park and the Cebu I.T. Park and in the uptown Mango Avenue, Osmenia Boulevard & the North Reclamation Area plus the downtown Cebu City can equal Makati City.

Plenty of high rise skyscrappers are competing each other everywhere and the night lights here are so bright and dazzling it looks like the Champ Elyesse in Paris, France. Makati has no world class beach resort & diving sites while Cebu has plenty.

Who wants to live in a place where everything becomes fast and junk; fast foods-junk foods, fast sex fast happiness fast life junk life? This is a place where only the fittest can live to enjoy and Makati is a place for the rich and famous the poor live near rivers and canals who serves as embankment for the coming flood.
