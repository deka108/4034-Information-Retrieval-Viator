Planning a family getaway but only got a weekend to spare? Genting Highlands' theme park may have closed, but here's whole list of activities for both the young and old! 

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/visit-gentingPlanning a budget weekend getaway? Genting Highlands' theme park may have closed, but here's a list of activities you can enjoy with your family!","Let's critique the author's points.

2. Price is enough to put anyone off. With The coach price i can even fly to bangkok. And who even enjoys bus rides? Seriously. 

3. I ' ve never really heard anyone giving food as a reason to visit genting. Congrats, you are first

4. WOW! You actually still book hotels based on stars!!! Impressive. Why not look up tripadvisor and marvel at the reviews of this worn down hotel?

5. Really? You prefer to go up the mountains to do that? You mean you can't do that in singapore? Oh MY.

6. Nice, you mention it's cheaper than singapore, but than the whole malaysia is. What you fail to mention is that places like penang and KL are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. Picking at straws already?

7. i'll sponsor you glow sticks, if you actually think bowling in a glow in the dark bowling arena is fun, and worth a trip to genting. 

9. It'll be exciting for five minutes, until you realise you're looking at just trees tres and trees. Have you never been on that cable car?

TLDR; poorly written article, worst i've ever read on travel. Load of lies.$$I've just came back from last weekend genting trip...can't say I don't enjoy because I did especially when you're with the best people, it doesn't really matter where u go.. 

The food nope..I could only count two good enough place to eat and the others are just fast-food if you're okay with it.

We played arcade for fun and karaoke and just bask in the cool air.

The only buffet we had was  coffee terrace but I saw one big cockroach over there near the coffee and tea. Enough to put me off that station. But the other food spreads are good enough,thank god.

The customer service over there have dramatically declined. SERIOUSLY. Plus, check-in time at 3pm. And if you are to check in at the counter, there's a charge and if you were to check in early,there's also a charge. Plus, pay your precious wifi and can only use at the lobby. Just go starbucks people and chill and get ur coffee and wifi there. 

Other than that, I will still go Genting just for a short vacation with family or friends. My best holiday place is Bangkok still though, first on my list. üëç$$1 reason not to visit for now.

What is it? 
This island group is composed of the main Olango Island and its six satellite islets. The site is a wildlife sanctuary that serves as a pit stop for migratory birds that come from as far as China, Japan and Siberia.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Fun Fact: 
The seven islands of the Olango group are joined together by a continuous reef. This makes the site a nice diving spot as well.

We were raised to drink our Kopi out of plastic bags; and call every Tom, Dick, and Harry 'Uncle' and 'Auntie' without batting an eyelid; but here are 13 oddities of Singapore life as seen through the eyes of a foreigner.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/living-in-singaporeFrom drinking out of a plastic bag, to generally despising the hot weather: these are some of the weird things that Singaporeans do which us foreigners wouldn't expect!","I moved from the UK to Singapore about 2 months ago. I can relate to most of these, especially point 4!!!$$Very interesting article which I can relate to as my wife is originally from Singapore. However let's not forget about the massive amount of plastic pollution that comes with all the food and drink packaging, as well as plastic bags used. We go back to what I call my second home a lot, and each time we notice the continual disregard for disposal packaging / plastic bags used at food & drink outlets and supermarkets. In this modern day and age we should be more environmentally conscience, and using more decompostable/biodegradable packaging should be the norm! I know this mainly comes down to government policies. Moreover the government does all the recycling for residents; people don't participate in their own waste management thus they do not see the importance of sorting out their rubbish and recycling, unlike countries in Europe and even Japan who are really good with residential recycling. Everyone needs to do their part in helping to reduce land waste as it's one of the most serious threats to our planet. Besides that, Singapore is still a great country to visit.$$I went the other way around ... relocated from Singapore to London last year. It's the same way ...So many things I miss about home, and so many cultural nuances to learn!$$Not just Singapore, in Malaysia it's exactly the same as well. I'm originally from Malaysian and currently studying in Edinburgh and I'm very surprised I've never seen ants and cockroaches here before... which is really odd$$It is good that the foreigners are mixing enough with the locals to even notice these differences. It used to be that ""expats"" kept very much in their own circle of friends, culture n habits, that by the time they leave they hv not much clue about the way of life of the country they had lived in for a while. I had a foreigner friend who thought she was going for a scary adventure when she visited the ""heartland"" and hoped none of her friends saw her doing it. And eating out of plastics,...you got to be kidding.$$Love this. ... thanks for posting. ... we are true blue  Singaporeans. .. !!
'Hot to death.  Hate the sun!'
Can  lah. .cannot. .can  can. .
Auntie. ......
I do get made when someone  calls me Auntie. .hahahahaha$$Used to be banana leaves and condensed milk tins with raffia tied in a loop through the lid.$$Put the maid up in the broom closet and then say she's treated ""like one of the family.""  

Nice family.$$Point 3. The kids go to communal areas to play, and the dogs just poo on their walks or get brought out to poo i suppose!$$That drink they will hang it every where.. I luv SG. Been there for 12 yrs.. Nice food. Nice country.. Nice people... Full of fun.. Best foods.. Everything...$$Lol!  Yes, I have already shopped for CNY decoration and will take down Xmas deco after Jan 1 & put up CNY deco.     2017 is roaster year üòäüëç$$Yup.. its christmas but they already putting up decorations and advertisements for cny!$$Helen Tan Alan Tan hope u guys are good at point 5 by now..$$For number 3, some owners have pee trays at home for their pet to do their business$$Not forgetting the unique method of ""reserving""/ chiok your seat at hawker stalls with tissue paper packets.$$Joyce Jordan - do you remember we seen the locals eating ice cream sandwiches ?

An opportunity to chill out from the noise and to rediscover Singapore, and definitely to recharge for the coming week.

http://japan-magazine.jnto.go.jp/en/special_koji-honpo.html ","thanks for Love        LOVE    JAPAN$$Dear Sirs,                             
For 5 years I am an active user of SONY VAIO LAPTOP and SONY PLAYSTATION and very satisfied with the SONY products. For 6 years I use mobile phones from Apple and that what I have to complain about, that happened to me in these 6 years with any of my Apple products.
Through the media, my attention was drawn slowly but surely on the SONY deals on smart phones and was on November 22, 2014, I became a member of the Sony family, because I bought the Sony Xperia Z3 COMPACT (IMEI 355179065283809). First of all I was annoyed that I had not sooner worried me the phone because I loved the design, battery life and until I broke the glass of the back in my pocket by the software about two weeks ago and I injured my finger , Although I have understanding that it may be different in reality than promised in the ads, but that the back so fragmented, although it has come to a pointed object, surprised me very much.
I brought the phone to the competent charging and not surprised that I did not meet the warranty conditions and had to pay 90 TL for changing the glass back. Finally I sat down on it. It has lasted two weeks until I got the phone.
I realized immediately that the Proxmity sensor was not working and was told by the service that the Geraet was incorrectly installed and repaired it. After all the trouble I used the mobile phone full of joy and bought an expensive protective cover to protect it from further unexpected accidents.
But the blow came faster than expected and has brought the camel's back. Last night as I wanted to put me into the car, the phone fell out of my pocket on the ground, there was a height of 30 cm. The glass of the front and the back broke, even though it was in the case is a thousand pieces. I can not afford absolutely no understanding that the phone after a fall of 30 cm can come into this state. None of my friends can not believe it that the phone came with a simple fall into this state.
I'm really disappointed in Sony because they have such bad use or sensitive material, without considering that there is some device (finally a '' MOBILE '') which should withstand some shock or mishaps. For me it's just firmly around held between two panes of glass with fine black-cheap plastic thing that simply join in anything. Frankly, I'm disappointed in myself that I have the Sony familiar advertising and have too little research on the user comments had experienced in the hundreds same.
I can not understand that Sony has chosen as a marketing strategy that finally we have no complaints million per country, only a few hundred. I also do not see that it enters the warranty conditions, although the choice of the material just heard of being attributed to producers and for which the user is not enough information has been advised of the sensibility of the glass.
I should point out that I will do everything possible to make my consumer protection claims and as long as this publicly manifest until I get my right because SONY  Turkey does not take any action and they do not give my money back or change my phone!!! Please help me about this problem as you do to your customers in the United States Of America and United Kingdom and Japan.
With best regards

3344,240054519398747_1013108762093315,"To anyone who has shared moments over socials with our local mountain guides, exchanging stories in the campsite under starlit skies or along the trails, I'm sure one way or another, you've heard them share about how much their livelihoods have been helped by being a guide or a porter.

Carrying one's heavy pack along with the items of the rest of the group throughout the duration of the trek, which could last up to 10 or more hours per day depending on the trail, is something mountain guides and porters are willing to sacrifice for in exchange for a better source of income.

Where majority of our provincial lands' main source of livelihood rest in farming or fishing, most of these guides go back to such labor when they have no group to guide in the mountains.

But being a guide can earn four to five times more than what one can earn from fishing or farming in a day, and that is why they are willing to make the sacrifice and even eager to do so. At night in the campsite, they take shots of local rum, not to get drunk, but to ease their bodies from the pain and protect themselves from the cold. 

With better accessibility to the mountains, locals who lead groups visiting as guides or as porters, certainly have a better chance of living, and more money to feed their families.

We shouldn't take it against them for making a decent living out of being a guide or a porter. While there are those local communities who sadly and unfortunately abuse this opportunity, there are still those who do not and are very adamant about providing job opportunities for the locals while at the same time preserving the natural habitat of the mountains in their community.

From among these are the guides I met in Kanlaon Volcano in Negros. They limit climbers to 10 per day and require permits for any mountaineer visiting. They uphold the model for responsible mountaineering.

Last time in Summer of 2014 my wife and our girls went in mid-May and I went (because of work) in mid-June. For that month, I took a few lessons from a Korean neighbor to show up, surprising my wife and her parents with my new Korean reading abilities. It was easy to learn (as everyone says), I sure did surprise them with my reading in the car coming home from the airport, and what's most-- I still kick myself for never learning earlier when I lived there for 4 years!$$I taught myself the alphabets through internet and variety shows and now I can read em in moderate speed and Im constantly learning new words every day and how to use them.

I really hope to win the glasses for her to choose her favourite stylish glasses from them so to surprise her.$$Liked, followed and shared. Amazed with Owndays' simple price system and approach of owning a spec that matches one's lifestyle, fashion style and personality. Really like the posts on your FB! Been on a search for a pair as my present spec is few years old and couldn't seem to find one that fit my face size that I like. Hope I'll get to win this so that I can look great even as the bespectacled me! P.S.: saw a FB post about the lenses being able to block out the haze? That will be amazing for sensitive eyes.$$Early last year, I started experiencing severe vision blurring after I had stopped using contact lenses due to eye infections, which prevented me from reading books and computer fonts. My friend is an optometrist and she suggested that I let her take a look, turns out to be corneal staining. I had to refrain from contact lenses until it recovers but mine was a rare case and took almost a year to clear. 
I am so used to wearing spectacles now but the disadvantage is that my current pair does not go with all outfits, so I hope to win a pair of trendy glasses from Owndays to have more outfit choices (& maybe snap a hipster shot? ;)).$$What I really hate about wearing glasses is that some are just too heavy & uncomfortable that I often got headache after wearing it for whole day. Hope #Owndays  can help me find the PERFECT PAIR!$$I want to have a pair of spectacles which can highlight my eyes and bring out my personality. P.S. Is there a pair of glasses that can block out the haze? 
Instagram: macaron_macaroon$$I have been wearing this pair of glasses for 3 years and or so I take good care of it but regardless of how careful i am, glasses are bound to get damage by wear and tear overtime as currently i am serving NS and dropping of glasses are bound to happen :(

As you can see both the frames and lens are scratched and it really affects my vision especially at night which i have to deal with light glares and it makes me really uncomfortable!

i've heard of OWNDAYS long ago and been visiting different outlets whenever i chance upon to and i would say their designs i like would cost quite abit and for me as an NSF serving the 2 years in my country would already cost half of my 1 month's pay so i would really appreciate it if OWNDAYS is gives a pair of prescription glasses.

Kryvyi Rih is a city where human labor in alliance with nature has created unique landscapes and man-made lakes which is unique anywhere in the world. Welcome to the universal city where you will also find traces of life of the Aryan tribes, Scythian burial mounds, centuries-old oak trees, fantastically shaped rocks near the river banks, mountain stream in the desert, the Martian soil, waterfalls, caves and much more.

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University‚Äôs Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don‚Äôt welcome science. They didn‚Äôt provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport‚Äôs History.
That‚Äôs Why I Couldn‚Äôt to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Best Regards
Yours Cordially

Oftentimes, visitors get trapped in malls or in the four walls of their hotels and go home missing the real Cebu experience. The beauty of Cebu is far beyond what Cebu City is. The pristine beaches are a bus-ride away and some require crossing the seas to nearby islands. The luxury resorts in Metro Cebu may offer comfort but adventure is beyond the city. I think this is what makes Cebu an all-around island. It caters to any type of traveler - shiny malls for shopping, a vibrant night life for any type of party-goer, high-end resorts for those who have more to spend for picturesque selfies, highland adventure for those who want to take risks, crystal clear waters for the beach bums, spiritual journey to those who need some boost of faith, challenging mountains to conquer, a diverse marine life and more than anything a people ready to welcome any type of traveler from the world all over. All these in one island set Cebu apart from the rest.

To anyone visiting Cebu, get out of your hotel. Walk the city streets. Take the bus to its quaint towns. After all, Cebu isnt just a city. It's one hell of an island.$$Dont miss this 10 tourist spots in cebu too!

adapters for different countries are such a pain to begin with, let alone needing to charge everything I need to charge via USB from iPhone to GoPro to Power Bank to Quodos Light. (wah, see, 4 items, just nice)

no more fighting for power with my Macbook, Camera Batteries, Flash Batteries, omg - everyone travelling with me will hate me less for hogging all the power but anyways!! 

then they should just get their own xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger + power bank too hahahaa.$$Would love to have xPower PB10Q Power Bank... Always wanting to travel and capture my favourite moments. But somehow my phone goes into Low battery and did not have the chance to take my special moment! Hope this will help enhance my gadget efficacies...esp when I'm a gadget amateur!! Hope to win this!!$$Liked and shared! I would like to win the xPower PB10Q Power Bank as a birthday gift for my boyfriend! I think these power banks are made for people like my boyfriend who on internet for 24 hours, playing games, researching, snapping pictures especially, navigating at the same time even when overseas. We love traveling and will travel at least once or twice a year therefore, we really like to own this powerful gadget! (:$$i would say that xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save me when i am travelling, i need to charge my portable wifiegg and phone so that i can last a day with wifi when i travel !$$The charger is a lifesaver especially when I depend on my iPhone to capture moments on top of communicating and navigating. I also like to share the moments I capture and also revisit them during my free time. This charger ensures that there will never be a moment I can't capture. The multi 5 USB ports just makes things even better! Now 4 other friends enjoy such certainty as well (:$$I need that xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger during travelling. There's limited power supplies in the hotel room. Sometimes, u will forget to bring power extension too.

It's always a pain to charge everything at night from phones to cameras, flash batteries to Power Bank. With this awesome xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger, there will be no more hogging to the power supplies! :)$$I would love to gift the xPower WC3QT travel charger to my boyfriend as he often charges his devices (laptop and especially phone as he always play game)! It's important that he gets all his devices charged up and be ready for both school and work, and also when we travel together at a later time of this year! Since he's such a forgetful person, this multi-functional charger would benefit him a lot!$$I m always lugging around 3 portable batteries as I need to charge my iPhone and iPad! Please rescue my shoulders as they are aching everyday from the load I carry. I need xPower DC5S Charger to charge my iPad, my phone and my portable fan to keep me from fainting in this heatwave.$$The xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save my life because my phone's battery life is quite short. It would definitely need a mid-day charge if im using it actively as my GPS$$I think the xPower PB10Q Power Bank would be very apt to save my life from a dead phone. It's less a question of need but one of want, as my current portable charger is good for one charge and is the size of a KitKat. So this is less of an entry into a lucky draw, but more of a plea for a better, longer, phone life. PLEEEEEEAAAASSSEEEE$$xPower DC5S Charger will save my life whenever I'm overseas cos the number of available sockets in hotel rooms are either too far apart till my items are everywhere or there are simply not enough sockets for me to charge my phone/dslr battery/portable charger. With this, at least I can consolidate all my tech devices together without having to worry about leaving one behind! :)$$Liked & shared. I hope I can win the xPower DC5S Charger as I'll be going overseas next month & my family of 4 will be squeezing in one hotel room! This means that we need to fight for the electrical sockets to charge our devices when we reached back in our hotel room. So it would be perfect to owe the xPower DC5S Charger to increase the efficiency by charging so many our devices at the same time! Furthermore, the added advantage of the xPower DC5S Charger is that it comes with a removable handphone stand so that our devices will not be wandering around and we can save the hassle of finding them! :-)$$Liked and shared!

I definitely need the xPower DC5S Power, though it's a close fight with   xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger.

Given that I usually travel with someone else, getting enough power points for our numerous gadgets is a massive headache.

Count this: Camera (ok, not fair to count it cos it doesn't use USB but it does take up one power point on its own), portable power bank, phone, tablet, smart watch, and iPod (yes, I'm old skool... Cos I don't wanna drain my phone's batt.) and then multiply by the number of travelers and you roughly get the idea of how many power points we will need if not for the multi-USB charger. I can bring my own travel adaptor for just one charger and that's it.

Wei Ling Bimira, you'll agree...$$xPower DC5S Charger will definitely be a life-saver, not only for myself, but for fellow travellers in my group, especially on long road trips with no power source in sight. =)$$Item: the xPower PB10Q Power Bank. I need it to charge my phone whenever it runs out of battery whilst im overseas. Caused me to not be able to take photos and even, record beautiful moments.$$xPower PB10Q Power Bank will be my life saver!
I'm a heavy phone user and can't last a few hours without my phone!

What is it like?
The Danao Adventure Park offers eco-adventure tourism lovers another face of Bohol. Some of the many varied activities include kayaking, river trekking, rappelling, rock climbing, and visits to cultural heritage sites.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Tagbilaran.

Or take the Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry from Cebu to Tagbilaran.

Or take a boat from Cebu or any of the major cities in Mindanao to Tagbilaran.

Then take a bus or van to Danao.

The zipline in Danao is the Philippines's longest and tallest, running half a kilometer from one mountain to another. Only for the most hardcore adventurers, the zipline has been dubbed the ""sui-slide."" It's certainly not for the faint of heart.

When packing your bags for Boracay Island, shoes should be the least of your concerns. You'll be walking barefoot on the powder-fine sand most of the time. And sitting on it.

Come dusk, young boys and girls take to the beach to begin sculpting impressive pieces of sand art. For a small fee, they can even personalize the sand art for you!

A vinta's sail is made up of vertical stripes of assorted colors that represent the colorful history of the peninsula's Muslim community.

Fun Fact:
Vinta is also the name of a Moro dance performed to commemorate the migration of the Filipinos. Dancers imitate the movement of the vintas by balancing on the tops of poles.

Olu Deniz, a beautiful inland bay that stretches behind the cape, is now closed to yachts. The reason this heavenly place is called Olu deniz (""Sea of the Dead"") is attributed to the following legend;

Once a father and son were caught in a storm here and were in danger of sinking. The son claimed that if they approached the rocks ashore they could take shelter in a cove. The father on the other hand asserted that their ship would be driven onto the rocks and break up and that there were no coves around here anyway. In his terror of running around on the rocks, the father knocked his son (who was at the helm) into the sea with an oar and took over the helm himself. Just as the ship was about to hit the rocks on the cape, she turned into this calm, smooth watered bay. 

This is the reason they say the bay is called the Sea of the Dead, whereas what with the pine clad sandy beach stretched out like a tongue, the name ""Paradise Bay"" would be more fitting.

The Blue Lagoon of Olu deniz has calm, crytal clear waters which makes it ideal for a variety of water sports and a very safe place for children to swim. Part of the lagoon is now a protected area (and it`s a national park).

Will be traveling to Seoul to meet my niece for the first time and I was thinking hotel. But with all the wonderful reviews and opinions on hostels, I think I changed my mind. I will also try to incorporate a stay in an hanok. Thanks everyone :)$$3 - guest houses these days are comparable to hotels with sufficient comfort at a good budget...leaves you more pocket for many other activities to do in Korea :)) 

I wish to try 4 someday too.$$I've been to korea 4 times.. I'm prefering hostel because it's cheaper than hotel.. most of the hostel in korea are very clean and comfortable and worth for money.. since i'm a budget traveller.. i'll choose hostel as my fav accomodation most of the time during my stay in korea..üòÅ$$I always look for guesthouses since I travel alone most of the time. The price is quite affordable for people who don't mind small rooms and average cleanliness. You also get to meet new people during your stay~$$I haven't been to Korea , it depends on how much budget you have and where to go . For us who does not have a lot of money , but enough to visit Korea , a good budgeted place is much more affordable for us . Hanok will be good and a good affordable tour guide will be good .. I would love to experience to be living among Koreans , your culture , food , and much more . Thanks üòú$$Definitely hostel, the cheapest and most of the hostel near to public transport station.
I went twice to korea, i hope my 3rd time can be a hanok, wanna try... haha...$$It depends on my budget for the trip ~ but mostly my 1st priority is hostel bcos by staying in the hostel I can meet other travellers. However, occasionally I would like to stay at the hanok to experience the traditional culture of Korea or at the hotel as a reward for my self ^^$$Since I am a budget traveller, I always stay in hostel/guesthouse whenever I travel to Korea. But I also want to try to stay in a hanok if I can find an affordable one near the subway.$$for my 3 times visiting Korea, i stayed at hostel/ guesthouses. much cheaper and its clean. no problem at all. and i am comfortable with the staff :)$$Its depends on the budget. I would like to stay at the hanok house. If i travel with my family, i like everyone stay together.$$We came to Korea last fall and stayed in an AirBnB near Seoul Station. Is was really affordable for 2 people and close to everything! We plan to do it again this fall when we come back.$$I have never been to Korea, but that is in my plan. 
I think, because I love the classic style and history I would choose Hanok. That is beautiful, traditional, there is the soul of the Korean architecture. However I know that is expensive, I would choose it for just a short time period, than move to a hostel. There you can meet with lot of lovely people and that is not expensive, so you can save your money as well.$$For a budget traveller like me and sometimes solo traveller, hostel/guesthouse because it's cheap and I get to know new friends and it feels homey with the local owners/receptionist. I learn more about the culture. Money saved on the accommdation will be splurged on food and shopping. Still on my list on my list is the Hanok stay.$$I have been to Korea twice and have stayed there for a month each.  For a long staying traveller like me, I prefer to stay on a guesthouse considering the budget for accommodation.  I have stayed on guesthouses in Hongdae, Busan, Jeju and PyeongChang and everything was clean and organized.   The owners are very welcoming and helpful.  But I would love to try Hanok someday. Do you have any recommendations on affordable hanok to stay in?  Í∞êÏÇ¨Ìï©ÎãàÎã§.  üòä$$For my next trip I'm definitely staying at a Hanok house!!! I love the architectural beauty and simplicity of these houses and I've always wanted to stay in one. My last trip I stayed at an airbnb, I wasn't impressed.$$Hostel/guesthouses because usually it feels as if you are staying with a friends family so you learn more about the local culture. There is more of a personal touch. And Hanok stay also was surprisingly comfortable and a very unique experience. Anyone who visits Korea should try it at least once.$$I have stayed in AirBnB places and have found it much more affordable, especially since I can cook a few meals and do laundry easily. I would love to try a hanok but there is no way I could sleep on the floor.$$For my second  trip to Korea Ihave booked Hostel in the Hongdae area in Seoul as I love this area very much and would  like to meet other people$$Hanok. I always got good price and the experience was perfect. Due to the small size of the Hanok Guesthouses I could create a friendly relationship with the owner, they even acted like being my mother :), by which l could get closer to real Korean life.$$Annyeong KTO teams, i prefer to choose hostel because it's cheaper and affordable for me ... But someday i want to try to stay in a Hanok because it's very unique and beautiful. I want to feel how to stay in Korean traditional house like i usually see in Kdrama. Kamsahamnida üòÑ$$Hanok and I'd like to try to rent an apartment one day to live the Korean life but I think its so expensive.

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University‚Äôs Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don‚Äôt welcome science. They didn‚Äôt provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport‚Äôs History.
That‚Äôs Why I Couldn‚Äôt to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Best Regards
Yours Cordially

It is located in the central east of Akita Prefecture. The deepest point of the lake is 423.4 meters and shape is almost perfectly circle. However cold the weather can be in winter, the Lake is so deep that it wouldn‚Äôt freeze at all.

Let us tell you the myth about this girl ‚ÄúTatsuko‚Äù in the golden statue.
There was a girl, Tatsuko, in the area of Lake Tazawa. Everybody knew she was beautiful and attractive. One day when she realized she truly owns beauty, she started clinging to it. She did not want to lose neither her beauty nor the youth. She wanted them forever that she went to shrine to ask for a help. ‚ÄúGuanyin‚Äù(enlightenment being in Buddhism) suggested her to drink water of the lake as much as possible. She kept drinking with suffer, gradually, she turned into ‚Äútatsu‚Äù (dragon). Since then, she started living in the Lake. Her husband experienced the same thing in the northern lake. He, also in a dragon shape, came to Lake Tazawa, and they have lived together. Having two owners, Lake Tazawa got deeper and deeper.

She lists 5 reasons why Marine Parade GRC voters should vote for The Workers' Party. (Okay she gotta work on her listicle writing skills lol)

http://mustsharenews.com/sylvia-lim-goes-all-buzzfeed/ ","In my opinion, 5 reasons not to vote for WP as follows:
1. Wayang Party (WP) - make a lot of noise at rally but keep quiet in Parliament
2. Flip flop like roti prata, first, your party - Gerald complained about too much foreigners 4 years ago. Now he complained about the u-turn on immigrant policy which is hurting business ?? So what do u all want? Complain everyone can but where is your proposed solution 3? 
3. Like to launch personal attacks on PAP candidates - called LKY a liar and Shanmugan a barking dog - is this ur so called a first world parliament ??
4. Greed for Power - have not shown us results in terms of managing a GRC well yet going after a few more GRCs n SMCs. 
5. Growing Arrogance - see themselves as the best of the best n disregard the other opposition parties - if you can't respect others how do u expect others to respect you$$1. So if we vote for WP, there will be less senseless change? Can the WP stop it?

2. Three bad policies? There's an entire book on his achievements. Go google it.

3. People don't understand or know how difficult it is to persuade anyone to come forward and be a Minister. Having to balance conflicting demands from all sectors of society is an impossible and thankless task. Whoever becomes a Minister will always suffer brickbats because no policy can satisfy everyone. Ask yourself, how many people are willing to put themselves in the firing line knowing they can never satisfy anyone, and they will be flamed no matter what they do. Yes, Chuan-Jin can still contribute in other ways, but how many are willing and able to be a Minister? It is so damn hard lah, please.

4. Accomplished team? I looked up Bernard Chen and he has only worked for only less than one year. And you expect me to believe he can run a town council?? YJJ and the rest have only started to work the ground this year. Previously, only saw YJJ in Joo Chiat and nowhere else. I don't think that's as accomplished as the rest of the MPs who have been here for more than one term.

5. Agree, and national interest to some like me means Vote PAP to make the Opposition work harder!$$WP stop talking nonsense lah... I am not going to vote for you.. my vote goes to PAP.$$So what solutions do u have for the above huh???$$OK....  What actually ARE the 5 reasons ?$$Since when this site became political?

Both a volcanic island and a marine reserve, this island has become a favorite diving destination in the southern Philippines.

this is totally the camera for me. I've been eyeing a flip screen camera for so long. with this camera, there will no longer be failed selfies, cutting off faces or wrong positioning. IT WILL ALWAYS BE PICTURE PERFECT <3

thank you TheSmartLocal for sharing this awesome post! love your other food and travel posts as well.$$Taking photos is what I usually do during the weekends when I'm out of camp. Dedicating photos to Instagram (@jonaskohh) and my personal blog (glimpsedthrough.blogspot.com), it can be a little troublesome to bring DSLR out and therefore Panasonic Lumix GF7 will solve the problem of bringing a bulky camera out during the weekends.

With the ability to pinpoint a subject with a touch of the screen and let the camera determine the correct focus and exposure, it definitely helps to take great Instagram photos or even photos to be uploaded onto my blog! 

With a build in wifi and providing easy connection, I can easily transfer photos from the camera to my phone and with that, I can upload them to Instagram right away! 

Apart from taking photos of still life, I will also take photos with my friends and with a 180 degrees tiltable monitor, selfies will definitely be a breeze!$$Dear TheSmartLocal.com!

I would like to own this cool Panasonic Singapore newest camera, Lumix GF7! Why? Reason is that simple!

Firstly, I love photography and it can be stress to take a nice photograph without a good camera that can focus my object well or the setting of the exposure can take sometime to adjust to the correct setting especially in our sunny Singapore!

With Lumix GF7, it can solve this problem for me! I simply need to pinpoint a subject which I want to capture by simply touch the screen and the camera will determine the correct focus and exposure or I just tap to take a photo without need to adjust anything!

What I like about this Lumix GF7 is that, I could wefie with my friend by selecting Selfie function! This camera in build 180 degree tiltable monitor where I can take photo with my best buddy by choosing Buddy Shutter or Face shutter! I think we will prefer the face shutter where we just need to cover our face with a waving hand to capture the photo!

Not to forget the coolest function will be Easy Wi-Fi!! Why? I can simply connect the camera or any of the smartphone or tablet and I can start sharing the photo images to my friend instantly and we could post to Instagram or Facebook immediately!

I will really love to own this camera!! :)

I AM SOLD ALR!! I really hope I can win this!! I've been wanting to get a camera for myself since ages ago. However being a full time student means not being able to work and earn enough to get a new camera. Hence, I really hope that I'll be able to win this so I can capture pictures with my loved ones and upload it to social media. This camera would be perfect to capture pictures and memories with my mum and my dad and being able to print out a quality picture to hang up on our walls!! :) With a camera like this I'll be able to capture the happiest and most candid photos of my parents and surprise them with a photo album!! <3$$Here's three functions of the Lumix GF7 that impressed me and which I'm really keen about!

1) Built-in WiFi function (here's to uploading Instagram-worthy shots immediately after taking them)
2) 180 degrees tiltable screen (high quality selfies guaranteed)
3) Jump Snap function (by using your phone as a remote control, capturing good jump shots have never been easier!)

Hope that I can win the Lumix GF7 so that I can bring my Instagram photos (@raphaelhugh) to the next level! Won't need to rely solely on the iPhone 6 any longer haha. Thanks!$$I definitely would love to be the winner of the new Panasonic LUMIX GF7! 

Here are my reasons why (5 reasons in total...does this increase my chances?): 

1) it takes WONDERFUL photos in bad lighting (when I did my research I was pretty amazed by the photos that it was able to capture in different lighting conditions)

2) Wi-Fi connectivity!!! Say goodbye to the traditional and painful way of uploading photos on to Facebook/Instagram. In addition, it always takes pretty long for the photos to appear on fb due to laziness (we have been all there, haven't we?) Now, with wi-fi I can immediately share all my photos to Facebook and Instagram! What a dream! üòç

3) HIGH QUALITY SELFIE FUNCTION WITH AN 180 LCD TILT SCREEN PLUS BEAUTY FUNCTIONS!!!! MUST I SAY MORE?????? 

4) Interchangeable lenses *.* *.*

5) Did I mention that it LOOKS and FEELS incredible? Seek, classy and light. Just what I need. 

Best. Fashion. Accessory. Ever.$$1 Key function: 180¬∞ Tiltable Monitor for Selfie with Face Shutter & Buddy Shutter

Pardon the cheesy line, it's love at first sight! üòç Really in love with its chic and stylish look which is like a classic camera. It will be the perfect companion on my cafe hopping adventures and my brother's (Weihong Peh) hunt for elusive places (which is the reason why I click on this post). Read reviews that it's easy to use (so not as intimating as a DSLR for an amateur photographer like me) but powerful. It's able to capture shots & colours under low lights, which is essential on my food hunts. Plus, I can now easily take selfies and wefies and upload it quickly with its inbuilt beauty and Wifi functions (yeah!). Most importantly, it's light! I can take LUMIX GF7 with me wherever I go and take shots single handedly. Awesome! 

I have trips with family and friends up coming. Will be perfect to have LUMIX GF7 with us to capture these memorable moments. Thank you @TheSmartLocal.com  for sharing this post and giveaway! Will really really love to win and own @Panasonic Singapore LUMIX GF7 please.$$Liked & Shared! <3

Pls let me win, this will be my first selfie and wifi camera for my coming trip! Thank you TheSmartLocal.com & Panasonic for the chance! üòä$$Built-in WiFi with Easy Connection its so convenient to upload photo onto instagram !$$Hello! I'd love to win this camera for a lot of reasons but I'll just state one key reason as requested. 

The WIFI connection! 
Just because it makes things so easy, especially for someone lazy like me! No longer have the excuse to procrastinate sharing the beautiful pictures taken with PANASONIC LUMIX GF7 (If I win).

Thanks!$$I love the 180 degrees Tiltable Monitor which would allow me to take photos together with family and friends :) In addition, the Built-In WiFi would enable me to post photos on facebook and instagram without going through the trouble of transferring the photos onto my computer or phone first. Winning this camera would allow me to finally seriously pursue my interest in photography, which was always deterred by my lack of funds to purchase a quality camera or phone :( Thanks to TheSmartLocal.com and Panasonic Singapore for providing such an opportunity :)$$It has a motion activated shutter, 16 megapixels with the wide angle lens kit and even built-in wifi with easy connection! I'll be going on a school trip to Hong Kong in two weeks for 5 days and to the Philippines for a little more than a week shortly after that, and I'd love to document my trips without the hassle of having to film with my dslr which would be heavier and less compact. Would totally love to win this!$$Panasonic Lumix GF7 Camera has this very special and important function for a very Singaporean like me, the 180degrees Tiltable Monitor for Selfie!!!!!!!!!

I am waiting for the day my mobile banking apps can let me withdraw and deposit cash, i believe that day will come$$As an 18 year old man / boy / guy / student, technology has vastly improved my life. 
First of all, lets talk food. Applications like foodpanda, deliveroo, mcdelivery , ect has made ordering of food through calls a thing from the past . We can order food so easily now,  by just tapping, swiping, ordering and paying . "" Hardworking"" and ""busy"" students like me don't have to waste time , going to a hawker centre or fastfood restaurants to queue and wait for food now . There are even apps like Honestbee and RedMart  , that delivers groceries to our homes. 
Secondly , we have applications like zalora , cotton on , sephora , that allows us to order fashion items back to our homes without travelling. We can even buy gifts for our friends through apps like these . Its fast , easy and definitely it has made our lives more flexible . 
There are so many things i can say about technology , though it has it's downs , the ups greatly overthrows them . It's 1:36 am and I have school tomorrow , so imma go now .

Mobile applications have also made it possible for us to pick up languages and other skills during those bus rides & MRT rides, turning self-improvement in our packed school/work lives from a fairy tale to reality. :) With all this advancement of technology, we are now more inspired to further technology, and imagine a better, more flexible future for ourselves. :)$$Liked and shared

I am a InDIYpendent Singaporean in overseas too. I remembered during my last customer visit in Shanghai. When I boarded the plane bound for Shanghai, I saw many business travellers boarding the planes with cakes and gifts for their clients or maybe their loved ones. As a InDIYpendent, I simply place my cake orders from a portal and they delivered to my hotel. So simple. No sweat.$$The advanced in technology has made travelling a less-hassle, enjoy our favourite food as and when we want and also time-saving when it comes to shopping and grocery buying. This was not even possible 5 years ago and we can see how fast technology has progress to enable us to lead a fuss-free life. What i envision in 2030 to be more convenient and faster than the current technology just like those in superheroes movie XD$$1. Like and share THIS post
2. Technology has made life more flexible. We can now order food online and have it delivered to our homes. Video Chat with family from oversea. It is like they are just next to us. And we no longer need to go to the library or book store to get the books we love. Just dowload the ebook for your reading pleasure anywhere and any time.$$The convenience technology has provided us can be felt not just by customers, but also by those working in the f&b line. Taking of orders used to be by paper and pen, which is not just troublesome and time consuming, and order papers could be easily lost or destroyed. But now with technology, we can easily key in the orders into the cashier and immediately both service and kitchen would have machines churning out the orders without mistake through wireless internet. And now customers can get their food and be happy B| 
(liked and shared~)$$technology has made life more flexible in three ways. 
one, when i am stuck in a deserted toilet with no toilet paper i no longer have to use my socks or wait 300 years for someone to come, i can just call someone with my handphone to come down with supplies.
two, when i am the loner at the party i no longer have to stare around awkwardly, i can whip out my phone and pretend i have a life and so many people are messaging me oh gosh.
three, when i see all the cool new phones and lappies i gotta catch em all so technology has given me new and innovative ways to become a poor and bankrupt student.$$Long long time ago when I was in my late teens and early twenties, I have many friends who broke up because one partner is going overseas to study. A few more years down the road came msn then Skype and now FaceTime. If they are born in this era, they wouldn't need to break up la. They have the flexibility to video call on PC/ Laptop or FaceTime/message/call using various phone apps. Technology have saved many ‚ù§Ô∏èrelationships‚ù§Ô∏è.$$Liked & shared!

No more letter writing which take time to reach my friends save on paper and effortlessly to stay in touch! Tagging Jennifer Ong Boon Chye$$I love how technology allows and helps me in communicating with people on the other side of the world. I would look forward to every night as i would be able to video call my mom as she moved to Thailand. We would talk about everything and anything HAHAHA it almost felt like we were side by side and things were the same like when i was a little kid. I am kind of an awkward potato andddddd im an introvert. I used to bury my head in books and not socialize with people of my age but playing online games has helped me out tremendously as it made me feel comfortable talking to strangers and connect with people from other parts of the world. From chatting behind a computer screen and slowly to video chatting with my best friend from maplestory. She has helped me to become a more social person and made me feel comfortable in my skin because I was made fun of alot in school and was an outcast. But, she was there for me and I would always look forward to going home and pouring my emotions out to her. She was a good listener. She taught me to create a blog and let me share about my life experiences. I'm so glad technology was invented and really glad that i have met my first true friend :)$$Technology has made life so much more flexible in so many ways. Communication is one of the aspects that have become much more convenient. Previously, once the date and time have been fixed, it is hard to change it at the very last minute. With smartphones, we can now create group chats and update everyone on the date and time to meet with a simple message. Also, it has allowed many cross-border exchanges, be it travelling or business deals, and strangers, friends and even families are able to connect despite being in different countries.

Look forward to more exciting developments in the next generation of technological advancements. Hope I can still keep up with it in my 60s, 70s... :) Our lives will be more intertwined with technology!$$Technology has made my life easier and more convenient. From online banking to online shopping to ordering your taxi from your smart device. All it takes is a push of a button and sometimes you may not even have to own a credit card to enjoy having everything sent to your doorstep. Yes, some shops accepts COD! :-) But what I love most about these modern conveniences is that I get to spend more time with my kids and husband. The time supposed to be spent in walking to Sheng Siong and hauling 30 kilos of grocery with 2 howling kids in tow is now better spent playing catch in the park or watching movies at home with my feet propped up. Other than that, I am on extended maternity leave because I can work from home and submit my reports online. How cool is that? Perhaps I will order that chicken rice from that flying boat after all.

Liked n shared!$$As Singaporeans, we love our food as much as we love our choices. With the advancements in technology, not only has our food become more delicious, dining has become more fun as well.

For instance, many would agree that having sushi off the conveyor belt not only allows us to dine at our own pace, the myriad of choices is also part of the fun. 

Having Korean BBQ wouldn't be as fun if the meat came to your table properly grilled as opposed to cooking it to your desired doneness, thanks to technology that makes it possible for diners to grill the meat and eat it right after.

And what about designing your own fluffy pancakes from bottles of pre-coloured pancake batter? 

All these dining experiences would not have been possible if technology did not exist - no longer do we need to prepare food beforehand before sitting down to a meal with friends or family - with technology, even the cooking can be an activity that bonds people.

We cannot deny that the future of food is closely linked with the advancement in technology. After all, one day we may be able to have our meals in a self-driving vehicle while taking in the beautiful scenery - life does not get more flexible than that. ;)$$Technology made our lives easier by allowing us to read almost everything and anywhere via our smartphones, so now I can just read stories and articles (esp thesmartlocal articlea :P) on the go!",2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sorry, but  isnt that nazi's symbol? omg. really sorry ._.$$In eastern teachings swastika means eternity or higher being while during WW II Hitler's Arian movement meant what it the world has become to known it as much twisted & malevolent value to such a peaceful symbol!$$The swastika was the symbol of good fortune, prosperity, and longevity in many Far Eastern countries. The word swastika comes from the Sanskrit svasti, which means good fortune, luck, and well-being. In Buddhism, the swastika represents the turning of the ‚ÄúDharma wheel‚Äù, and thereby promotes goodwill, compassion, and generosity to all sentient beings. Regrettably, Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party borrowed the swastika in the early 1900s, reversed it, and used it as their party emblem during World War II. Not only do the Nazi swastika and the ancient swastika used in Buddhism and Eastern cultures differ in meaning, the Nazi swastika is also slanted, resting on a point, and has right angles bent in a clockwise direction. The traditional swastika lays flat and is counterclockwise.$$The ""swastika"" symbol is seen all over the Buddhist temples!  It is actually a VERY ancient symbol with that has been used by Hinddis (?

What is it like? 
On the first day of September, the Filipino Christmas season unofficially begins. Christmas trees and star-shaped lanterns start to fill the streets. Schools start to put together plays about the birth of Jesus Christ. Christmas remixes of the year's most popular songs start to play on the radio. The whole country is transformed for a solid four months. It's the longest Christmas celebration in the world. And it also has a good claim to being the happiest. 

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
Adults or children form groups and visit homes at night to sing carols. When given change, young carolers typically sing a thank-you song in Filipino that goes, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so kind, thank you!"" When given change money, the song changes to, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so stingy, thank you!""

http://visitph2015.com/ ","Where exactly in Quirino is     this festival?$$Sorry this message is a bit long winded .                                                                                                                           Quirino is one of those provinces in Luzon that‚Äôs still off the tourist radar. Formerly part of Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino became a separate province in 1966. While most provinces in the Philippines are known for something concrete, Quirino‚Äôs identity has yet to be formed. It was this air of mystery for an ‚Äúoff-the-beaten path‚Äù destination that made me more eager to visit the province. The province is still raw and rugged in terms of facilities, but has a lot to offer in terms of natural attractions and eco-adventures. Nature-tripping and camping, caving, spelunking, trekking, rafting and outdoor sports are just a few of the activities that you can do here. The Sierra Madre mountain range provides a natural barrier on the eastern and southern border of the province and the Mamparang Range on the western part. Right now, it‚Äôs only accessible by land from Isabela, but roads are currently being built that will link it to other provinces. There is no airport in Quirino Province. The nearest airport is located in Cauayan, Isabela, which is about 1.5 -2 hours away by land. Several Bus lines (Five Star & Northern Luzon Bus Line) ply the Manila-Quirino route daily while NA Liner and KMS ordinary / aircon ply the Baguio-Quirino route daily. Aircon buses also ply the Manila-Santiago (Isabela route). From the Santiago terminal, you can take a van or jeepney to the different towns: Diffun, Cabarroguis, Aglipay and Madela, from where you can transfer to Nagtipunan. If you‚Äôre in a big group, rugged vehicles like jeepneys are the best way to access the mountainous areas that are the jump off points for tourist sights. The rugged roads and dirt tracks in mountainous areas are actually great for Motocross riders and mountain bIkers. There are no private motorcycle or bicycle rentals available yet in Quirino, but some groups are planning to offer this in the near future to cater to tourists. There‚Äôs currently a wakeboarding park and hotel being constructed in town. Expected completion is March 2015. The Motocross Cup held every June, in celebration of the Governor‚Äôs birthday, draws in thousands of motocross enthusiasts from around the country. Governor‚Äôs Rapids, a tributary of the mighty Cagayan River, is famous for its limestone formations. According to locals, there‚Äôs a waterfall inside a cave that you can only reach by riding a boat here. A 37-chamber cave system ideal for spelunking, with 8 chambers developed for caving for enthusiasts of different levels of ability. About 80 percent of the total land area of Quirino is covered by mountains and highlands. We got to enjoy a great view of the countryside while toploading on a jeepney on our way to Nagtipunan. The town of Nagtipunan, where the Cagayan River cuts across, is ideal for camping and eco-tourism activities including rock climbing, trekking, swimming, boating, rafting, excursions and fishing, among others. Capitol Plaza Hotel & Restaurant in Cabarroguis, the capital of Quirino, offers comfortable rooms for business and leisure travelers. It‚Äôs the largest hotel in the province, has a decent restaurant and large swimming pool, making it popular for local events.

One of the more unique food finds was Royal Tubikoy, a combination of tupig, bibibgka and tikoy. The native delicacy made of glutinous rice, coconut pulp, milk, sugar, cheese and shortening is produced by RNB Bukohan and Eatery, Aurora West, Diffun, Quirino.

While they look ilke dried flowers, fossilized flowers are actually made of alibangbang or butterfly leaves that have been dried, bleached and dyed. You can buy this in the Quirino Pasalubong Center right next to Capitol Plaza Hotel. There‚Äôs also a larger showroom and factory in town, where you can buy flowers in bulk. Other products that you can take home for souvenirs include wood carvings, indigenous handcrafted baskets and bags. Food items of interest include mountain rice, Tilanggit (tilapiang danggit), banana chips, polvoron, sampaloc candy, veggie kropek, veggie noodles, and native cakes.            Quirino has two seasons: wet & dry. According to tourism officials, the best time to visit is during the summer months. However, some activities, like caving, river rafting and trekking to waterfalls can be enjoyed all year around, even during the rainy season.

Quirino‚Äôs main festival is the Panagdadapun Festival held every September 8-10. The fiesta, which was first celebrated in 1999, showcases the province‚Äôs unique culture, convergence of people, and colorful history.
The Aquero Patronal Festival is celebrated every February 14th at the Nuestra Senora de Lourdes Parish, municipality of Aglipay.

The event is starting from 1:00p.m., but here is a secret tip that you can enjoy Yabusame!
Try getting up early to visit morning practice in the shrine. You can take your time among so few spectators and closely watch archers harmonizing themselves with horses, their skill with their spirit in the crisp morning air. They will take you back a millennium to the age of the Samurai.

What is it? 
It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

How to get there: 
Fly into Clark from Incheon, Singapore, or Hong Kong.

Or take a bus from Pasay or Cubao.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

First of all, NOT EVERY ONE reads Hungul. Not everyone speak Korean. So tourists are usually stuck with a lot of confusion on sign boards. Information overloading is rampant in Korea. One signboard with too many confusing inforaiton. And the Heading is: INFORMATION. And that is the only legible word.  KTX ticking is another big confusion: no return tickets, foreigners need to be a MEMBER to get discount (who cares to be a MEMBER?), and schedules all in Hangul, and ticket office no one speaks English. SUNCHEON Bay was high on my agenda. But I dropped the idea because moving around in Korea is pretty painful. Maybe I will drive my relative's car down south next time. I am not here to Spike Korean Toursim Board. But you really have to put your act together to improvement tourism in Korea. No wonder Tourist only know Seoul and Busan, and miss out ALL OTHER cities in Korea. Putting Sun Cheong here is meaningless, because for an enthusiastic tourist like me, (even if I read Hangul), its too painful to get from Seoul to Sun Cheon, and a risk of getting stuck in Sun Cheon with no hotel/motel to stay overnight.$$Yes indeed! An amazing scene of autumn. A lovely season to visit Korea!$$Autumn is so lovely season!$$what a belissful and wonderful pictuers from the automn in south korea$$Part of the experience of traveling is getting to experience another culture, another language.

In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

The earthquake that rocked the mountain on the 5th of June, 7:15am triggered landslides along with rocks and boulders that tumbled down, destroying trails and sadly, taking lives. Joseph was found beneath a boulder, in the heroic act of shielding two of his guests. Unfortunately, the three of them didn‚Äôt survive.

Joseph was last seen hugging two of his guests, in an attempt to protect them, using his body as a shield, an account related by his fellow mountain guide colleague, Sharulnizam Suhaji. Sharulnizam describes Joseph as an easy-going person with a good heart, soft-spoken and always kind. 

Joseph has been a member of our team for almost 2 months. He has brought nothing but good memories and experiences for our fellow climbers. A man of courage and uncompromising thoughtfulness. His good-will and high-spirits will forever be remembered by all the lives he has touched.

Please stop breaking down MRT!

http://mustsharenews.com/causes-of-train-breakdowns/Why do our trains break down? Find out here.","The infrastructure is not catered for 5.9 million population. In any time. Excess of 30% moving in peak hour will inadvertently crush the transport system. System will stressed whether the company do the maintenance is another thing. Lapses occur and now busy fixing it. Will it work? Time will tell.$$More to come...6.9m then 10m...$$The real problem is that the older main MRT lines have not been created with redundant tracks. Meaning you cannot fix any line without shutting down the line. 

This is why the MRT is not open 24/7. 6 hours in the early morning is devoted to maintenance. This is also why the newer lines have a third track. 

But for the original red and green lines, any kind of long term shut down is unthinkable because so much of our transport now revolves around the MRT. And yet any strategic overhaul of a rail system of our size requires at least 6 months. And the infrastructure is getting older and older.

Do you like rice, but don‚Äôt own a rice cooker? No need to worry, you can cook rice in a pot!
First, wash the rice and place in a pot. Add water (rice to water ratio is 1: 1.2) and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it is boiling, cover with lid and let simmer for 12-15 minutes over low heat. Remove the pot from heat (with the lid still on) and let steam for another 10 minutes.
With these simple steps, you can taste soft, fluffy rice whenever you want!

Let us know if you agree or have other tips for first-time visitors.Hong Kong is an incredible city and what I consider the gateway to Asia. Just about every local speaks English here so for first-time travellers to Asia,...","Stayed at Largos Hotel near Nathan Road during my first visit and I must say the location is perfect! Fact: For my three-day stay I toured around the city by foot. The only times I rode public transportation were from the Ferry Port going to my hotel and Bus going to the airport. I think t'was a great experience. I really enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the city coz my hometown is pretty much laid back and HK is quite the opposite! Will be back soon for sure!$$Usually i live near causeway bay mtr or, better for me, near tin hau mtr, whitfield Street.  Some tips: West Kowloon culture park...if you Like running go to quarry bay riveraide park so tou can enjoy also a view og kowloon bay. Take the bus from Central to repulse bay and Stanley market...then catch up some small beach for enjoy sun and quiet...come back to North and take a walking on the Mid Levels...then stop for get some good and drink there. Go to Tsim Sha Tsui At 8pm and enjoy the simphony of lights, so nice and so commercial..then so annoying maybe! Don't miss to taste an egg tart and take the ferry to come back to Island.$$I've always stayed in Hotels on, or near to Nathan Road. Everything from the various Markets to high end shopping. And the McDonalds (for the western palate). However, I'd like to try staying across the water next time. Maybe down near the Ding-ding tracks.$$We stayed at Courtyard Marriott in Sha Tin.  A little out of the way but if you time it right, there is a free shuttle that takes you to TST and back.  During our 2 weeks there, we really enjoyed this hotel especially the executive lounge - great snacks and drinks for free!$$You missed my favourite place to stay in HK which I'm not mentioning- you mentioned places around it- as I don't want it any better known than it is! :)$$Langham place (cordis) most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in.

Nice to be out of the complete hustle and bustle but feel like you are in the midst of HK.  Great bus links and eateries around as well as having amazing views of the park and harbour.  Definetely my choice whenever we visit :)$$These places are obvious locations and for tourists who want it safe but where money is not an issue. Other locations next to these locations such as Sheung Wan, Causeway Bay, Hung Hum, and even Tung Chung, are cheaper and just as convenient. The author should explore more than where all the tourists go.$$Loved the Excelsior Hotel on causeway bay . Hotel overlooks the noon day gun which is fired everyday at 12 noon$$Tips for whom travel by themselves to HK in the first time are to ask any information at the booth for visitors at the airport (a red booth), they advise clearly and stay in hostels in Mong Kok not expensive.$$Every time I've stayed in HK it's been at Garden View on McDonnell St, Central and it's a short walk down to the Peak Tram, a little further and you can walk to Central or Admiralty/ Pacific Plaza. Have to agree with the review.$$Courtyard at Connaught Rd. I loved walking around and discovered by accident the elevated walkways. Incredible.

Many guys just admire pretty girls from afar, hoping they could talk to them. Picking up girls is an intricate art, but we got it down to a science. Here's something new from our ""Talking to Strangers"" series.


Our aim is simply to help more Singaporeans meet each other, so they have more options and find more suitable partners for themselves. But this guide is not for everyone. If just the thought of girls being 'picked up' offends you, please don't read it.


Remember, the golden rule is to always be a gentleman. Be as transparent as you can, respect her and remember that she is your equal.

http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/pick-up-girls-sgMany guys just admire pretty girls from afar, hoping they could talk to them. Picking up girls is an intricate art, but we got it down to a science. Here\'s how.","There are so many things I could say about this article but I will limit them to the ones I can articulate well in the short amount of time I have. In an article entitled ""how to pick up girls"" promoting the woman as ""equal"" and not a ""prey' is mind-boggling if not shocking. As a woman, I am not sure how to feel, upset or pleased. Secondly, if the motive of the article is to ""find suitable partnerships"" I am not sure your title and some of the recommended tips, some of the language used is achieving the purpose. I  normally enjoy your postings, however, (as a recently returned Singaporean to Singapore and a humanitarian) if this describes in  nutshell how the  courtship processes begin then it speaks volumes (not heart-warming ones) about the moral and social fabric of the society. As an influential source that I'd like to believe your website is, I'd love to see ways of reforming this pretty sorry state.$$Ben Tan haha you know I find this article funny. I find this whole thing funny. Women preach equality and independance and strength.. you know what I wanna see? For once I'd like to see a girl with balls--yes BALLS--big enough to walk up to a guy she likes and talk to him. Not just stand there like some sexual butterfly giving out pheromones like she's queen bee. And while she's at it, how bout she pay for her own damn first date because chivalry is a girl's worst expectation. The guy doesn't even know if you're worth it and yet he's paying for you?! TIMES HAVE CHANGED PEOPLE. Foot your own bill, talk to guys, stop eye-fucking them, and for goodness sake don't expect a guy to impress you because he doesn't need your requirements of him. He doesn't need you to tick off your checklist in your pretty little heads because he actually loves from the heart. Wanna be equal? Here's a formula for you. LOVE IS A TWO WAY STREET. It's not about picking up girls. It's tough love people, deal with it.
Yours Sincerely

A big thank you to everyone who participated, and to GEOX for sponsoring this giveaway. Head down to the nearest outlet for their ongoing sales this weekend!$$Liked, Shared and love to win $100 GEOX voucher! I had a first pair of GEOX years ago, it was so comfy, and i would love to win a new pair cos the old one was worn to bits :p I could see that a new pair of GEOX boots will keep me warm when i travel to cool climates!!! :)$$Subscribed, liked & shared! I always have trouble on what shoes shall I pack when I travel. Thanks to this post, I am sure going to get a Geox product regardless if I win the voucher or not. But with the voucher, it certainly allows the let me have more pairs!$$When creating a pair of shoes, it is often a struggle between form and function. Not many can strike that fine balance between form and function -- GEOX shoes stand out not only because they have mastered this balance, but they have upped the ante by adding comfort to its highest possible level. 

I have never owned a pair of GEOX before but I truly believe that GEOX lives up to its name as I have seen a pair of GEOX that has been with my friend for almost 10 years. I want to win this GEOX voucher so that I can have a chance to experience this kind of relationship with a shoe! And then influence another person to get GEOX! Thanks in advance for this opportunity!$$Subscribed, liked & shared. Nope, I'm not winning this for myself. I'd like to win this for my mother. She would be traveling to Japan next month and the climate there is said to be really cold. She has never seen snow in her 62 years of living and she intends to wear her track shoes there as she's a thrifty woman. Therefore I sincerely hope to win this voucher so that I can buy her a pair of winter boots to keep her feet warm when she travels to Japan next month. That's the least I could do as a daughter I suppose and not let her wear track shoes while walking in the snow (: happy 2016 to you guys anyway! Cheers*!$$I should win this because Chiang Mai is a lovely place and I'm singing its praises because I have been to this city, had memorable memories and would love to return again. With its breezy mountain weather, cheap food and many cultural places of interest. It's amazing and way better than Bangkok if you are more into the Arts and Cultural sort of person. I did participate in the festivals like Loi Krathong (floating the boat on water) and Lanna (floating lanterns), it's awe- inspiring. And I wish to return to experience the wonder sight of the Sakura blooming and check off my bucket list too!$$I would like to win this for a very special someone Samantha Lee. She is my fiancee. She likes to travel around the world with me. She can definitely have this pair of boots to walk the world with me. Really hope to win this for her.$$I have been travelling a lot and realised that having a good trusty pair of shoes for travel is very important. Many times I have to pack like a pair of sneakers, pumps, slippers etc into my luggage which takes up a lot of space and weight, not forgetting those bulky thick winter coats when travelling to cold countries. Geox is a trustable brand for its comfyness which is stylish, at the same time, to match with all types of outfits! With this pair of boots, I don't have to worry about packing so many shoes into my luggage anymore! Hope I can win this and own my first pair of Geox! üòäüôÜ$$I should win because I only wear GEOX's shoes after I have foot problems.  It's the only shoes that helps me walk like a normal person again!

Having a good, comfortable for long walks and weatherproof pair of boots is extremely important to me especially since I have flat feet which makes walking for long periods of time challenging. Even Timberland boots only lasted maximum of 3 hours of walking for me when I travel.

I should win as I am a big fan of GEOX especially because of its  technological innovation and Italian style. Geox's footwear exemplifies this style and innovation, thanks to original designs and exceptional breathability. In Geox shoes and boots, a patented system consisting of a microporous membrane placed on top of a perforated rubber sole allows heat and humidity to escape from my feet, and keeps the shoes fresh and comfortable all day. :D Despite this enhanced breathability, many Geox shoes and boots remain waterproof and that's crucial living in Singapore where it can rain anytime anywhere! :)$$Liked & Shared! I wish to win this because a pair of waterproof boots is important to me as I love to explore places with wet terrain and not to mention that my feet would be able to breathe in them too!$$like and shared. would like to win a pair of winter boots for upcoming trip in New Zealand! heard that GEOX boots are light and comfortable!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/52-things-to-do-in-singaporeSome say Singapore is boring. I say that's complete bullshit. Here's a bucket list of 52 things to do in Singapore before you die. You will never be bored again.","And massages by the Singapore Visually Hadicapped?$$Do you know, besides SOTA being covered with greens.  We do have a butterfly trail in Orchard Road?  Real butterflies, purposely lured to Somerset down to Dhoby Guat with the selective planting of flowers along the walkways?$$For Asian Civilisations Museum, there was and is plenty of activities there for free.  Most recent was the Holloween Night.  And its free!$$Eat at Annalakshimi and pay as you wish.$$And have great Samosas and Chai Masala at the Sikh temple. Free of course, but ladies will need to have a shawl to cover their heads as they go into the temple.$$Then there is the Sembawang Hot Springs?$$Reflections at Bukit Chandu, I redirected a school with plenty hyperactive boys to visit that WW2 museum there.  Walk thru Hort Park where there are plenty of spaces to run around as well plenty of old school swings and plant covered little shelters to sit and generally have a cosy chat, hike up the little hill to the museum and hike down the other side.$$Thank you for sharing. You could include the MBS laser light show that happens everyday for free. Nice view of our CBD buildings at night too. :)$$This is a good starting point but not sure they are the top 52. Here are some other ideas, in addition to noting that 1/Legoland is in Malaysia and doesn't count! 

2/ Food Playground or another cooking school is a great way to learn about Singaporean cuisine - get involved
3/ Krangi memorial on ANZAC Day
4/ Sembawang Yacht Club
5/ Add in the view towers on Pulau Ubin and MacRitchine
6/ Visit a local brewery - tiger or jungle beer
7/ charter a boat with friends to see outer islands
8/ one of them has a crab festival - name escapes me
9/ East Coast Parkway Hawker Centre has chilli crab and can sit on beach - also reasonable price but annoying to get to
10/ Sentosa Fort
11/ Dragon boating, get involved before Christmas row competition which goes along boat quay
12/Go to the Paranakan house owned by NUS
13/ Malay Heritage Centre near Arab street - good for a feed but alcohol free
14/ The Green Corridor - where railway used to be -good for chilling, picnic and walk
15/ See a Chinese Opera around Hungry Ghost

What is it like? 
When fish swim in the same direction and in a coordinated manner, the behavior is called ""schooling."" But when they're together, interacting, it's called ""shoaling"". Fish shoal for protection against predators, better chances of finding food, and better chances of finding a mate ‚Äì a shoalmate! You can watch schools or shoals of fish when you go snorkeling in Puerto Princesa's marine attractions, such as Honda Bay.

Fun Fact: 
Fish don't just randomly join a group. Like people, they pick who to hang out with ‚Äì who their mates will be. And generally, they like large shoals with fish who are healthy and resemble their appearance. This is because a fish that stands out will be easy prey.

Raiding it almost cost a Network for Animals activist his life.
We located the building in the south of the Philippine mainland. An innocuous house at the end of a dirt road, hiding a grim secret: an illegal dog slaughtering operation, protected by well-paid security guards, who swung into action every time the killing commenced.

Our team secretly monitored the building. The heat, humidity, mosquito and ant bites took their toll. But it was nothing compared to what the poor dogs would experience:
Forced into rusting metal cages, their sensitive noses would know the aging scent of canine blood on the air. They must know their time is short, because those cages are hell-on-earth. Excruciating temperatures, horrific humidity, and nowhere to rest but on-or-under the bodies of your cell mates. No water. No food. No hope.
The illegal slaughterhouse owner earns more than $11,000 each month and protects his business with a pistol and fierce temper. Our team leader Mel and his companion Perry knew this when they were discovered hiding in bushes on July 14th. Mel ran until he almost fainted, but Perry was not so fast, or so lucky: He was captured.

Mel quickly returned to the slaughterhouse with the only available policeman. When it became clear that Perry had been abducted, four more officers arrived. Achingly slowly, the terrifying situation was diffused. 36 dogs were seized, and eventually our teammate was returned safely from the hostage situation. It could have been so much worse.$$WE LOVE AND PROTECT THE NATURE IN THE PHILIPPINES!

Visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a unique and exhilarating experience. Spectacular scenery, white sandy beaches and swaying palms combine with monuments and museums, world-class diving, swimming and sun basking make this a truly out-of-the-world experience. 

The Archipelago contains 362 volcanic islands scattered in the Bay of Bengal, with only 37 of these being inhabited. These lush green islands have colourful historical past, with strings of invasions by the French, Dutch, Japanese and British and wars between settlers and the native tribes. The Cellular Jail, where hundreds of Indian revolutionaries were imprisoned during the Indian freedom struggle, still stands tall. 

Descendents of these political prisoners and the local tribes of the area are the inhabitants of modern day Andaman and Nicobar. The tropical rain forests that loom close to the seashore are home to unique species of birds, and to tribes that still haven't learned to use fire.

Hi Helen, it is possible to rent an international taxi at the airport (there are booths inside the airport near by the arrival gates).

If you find that there is enough space and the cost for 4 bus tickets is similar to a taxi it might be okay.

If not, you might want to just take an airport bus like the one featured here. There will be buses going to Insadong, you can just ask at the ticket counter.$$Hi, KTO, thanks.

This just in - you can visit Dubai on holiday WITHOUT eating grass for the month. Did you know airfares cost just $383 and 5-star hotels cost less than $200/night? 

That's even cheaper than a vacation to Tokyo! 

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/budget-dubaiDubai is dubbed the city of dreams for good reason, and here's how you can explore this captivating city for under S$1,000!","If you are there for a shopping spree, head down there just before hari raya. They usually have a massive sales on the already competitive retail pricing. e.g. 1 belt from armani exchange can cost as much as 140 SGD, over there its just slightly over 80 SGD factoring in the exchange rate on an average day. 2 biggest mall, Dubai mall and mall of emirates. u can easily spend an entire day in each mall due to the massive landscape and plethora of shops. 

Point 7, if you are opting for the dune bashing, it is priced differently by the location and experience. I went for the more expensive package and its worth every penny. Dont scrimp on this and short change urself on the experience when u have endure a grueling 7+ hrs flight to there. 

Burj Khalifa is too beautiful to give it a miss. Book and reserve ur tickets online as it is often sold out. Its linked to the dubai mall and u can have ur shopping there. If u r interested, the aquarium is also in the mall. 

Weather is harsh and you will consume alot of water. Go grab the 10 liter pack to ur room and refill ur personal bottle from the 10 liter pack. Most hotels provide free maps for tourist in their lobby. Gold souk, spice souk and Dubai museum are within the walking distances from metro station. Dont take the taxi as not all their drivers are honest and being stranger to the place, they can take u for a roundabout ride with the meter rocketing and no one is the wiser.

One of the hotel I stayed before Avenue Hotel. Near to the metro for traveling and with plenty of brochures in their lobby for activities to embark on in dubai for tourist.$$Point 1: u can cut down ur cost by going for 3 stars hotel if u just need a place to crash for the night instead of having a luxury slp over. There are plenty of hotels to choose from and some of them even throw in the breakfast and WiFi into the package. Choose one that is within walking distance from the metro and u will have an easier time travelling around

Point 3: their metro is not like our mrt system and is abit confusing. They cluster a few stations into one zone. When u are buying ur ticket to board the metro, the fare is charged by zones instead of stations. Point to note, if u get a single zone ticket, u can travel to any stn within that zone for a trip. On the next trip, u can just top up this ticket and board the train to the next stn within the zone. But if you wanna travel to stns within other zones, u need to get a 2 zone ticket and this means additional costs. If I recall correctly, they have different charges for single zone or multiple zone ticket for travelling, so it might be wiser to look up more info on this when planning ur trip$$Ifah Majeed reading abt DXB and i got reminded of you!$$Angela Simon - this looks more fun.

Taal Lake, Batangas

What is it like? 
Since 1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. The most recent large eruption was on this day back in 1965.  Although considered active, this small volcano has been quiet over the last few decades. As a matter of fact, now there are hiking tours and overnight camping packages on offer.

Fun Fact: 
Want to know what it's like to swim inside a volcano? You can in Crater Lake. It's said that the high sulfuric content has medicinal properties. Some people have even scuba dived here. But don't stay too long. The lake's water also has high concentrations of boron, magnesium, aluminum and sodium in salt form.

This is a great place to take your family for a weekend getaway.

It just happened that Tagaytay is one of the highest point in the area where you can have a perfect view of the volcano and lake.

Mr. Trump,

I try my hardest not to be political.  I‚Äôve refused to interview several of your fellow candidates.  I didn‚Äôt want to risk any personal goodwill by appearing to take sides in a contentious election.  I thought: ‚ÄòMaybe the timing is not right.‚Äô  But I realize now that there is no correct time to oppose violence and prejudice.  The time is always now.  Because along with millions of Americans, I‚Äôve come to realize that opposing you is no longer a political decision.  It is a moral one. 

I‚Äôve watched you retweet racist images.  I‚Äôve watched you retweet racist lies.  I‚Äôve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy.  I‚Äôve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to ‚Äòpay the legal fees‚Äô of those who commit violence on your behalf.  I‚Äôve watched you advocate the use of torture and the murder of terrorists‚Äô families.   I‚Äôve watched you gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.   I‚Äôve watched you compare refugees to ‚Äòsnakes,‚Äô and claim that ‚ÄòIslam hates us.‚Äô  

I am a journalist, Mr. Trump.  And over the last two years I have conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of Muslims, chosen at random, on the streets of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.  I‚Äôve also interviewed hundreds of Syrian and Iraqi refugees across seven different countries.  And I can confirm‚Äî the hateful one is you.  

Those of us who have been paying attention will not allow you to rebrand yourself.  You are not a ‚Äòunifier.‚Äô  You are not ‚Äòpresidential.‚Äô  You are not a ‚Äòvictim‚Äô of the very anger that you‚Äôve joyfully enflamed for months.  You are a man who has encouraged prejudice and violence in the pursuit of personal power.  And though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are.

what is KTO??$$@Yan Amore Pioggia: We are the  KTO (official Korea Tourism Organization). ^^ Have you seen our website? Please check it out when you have time: www.visitkorea.or.kr.$$how on god's green earth are people confusing KTO with KBS? they are two totally different entities in two totally different industries and do totally different things! they only share one word in common: korean. LOL anyway, KTO is a great ambassador for korea...keep it strong! :-)$$Oops!! Someone mix up KTO with KBS??? No no no!! Please be rational when we need to tell what we think and what we need to the world. Please do not bombard the parties which didn't involve in this disgraceful issue! 

BTW, KTO, I really like Korea but this issue is a true let down...I can accept the boycott of JYJ in other issues (like QTV issue, the members are banned from the music programme, etc...) however an honorary ambrassador on behalf one government are banned from the show? No way - it really looks ridiculous to international world, and it seems to us that: even government can be brought off or need to kneel down in front of the pressure from private sector.$$I love Korea and I like KTO because you are doing a great job to spread Korean love everywhere. But honestly, Korea is lossing respect and love because of the JYJ incident with KBS and Jeju. I think fans just want to raise attention from everywhere so I just posted on your wall ^^. I hope that you wont misunderstand JYJ fans just because of those comments. And it would be great if the problem is solved fairly and the bad ppl are punished$$JYJ incident has been an example of how cruel part of entertainment world and it possibly can happen in other country as well with other actress/or.  We totally understand, the scope of KTO is much wider - it's more than just entertainment world, it's all bout Korea country, the  people and their habits, unique culture, yummy culinary world, and promote the entertainment world as well, as part of the korean wave program.. keep spreading Korea's world to us, i love to hear the updates... btw, like the profpict,been to Carribean bay and Ocean world last year, those are the two of my fave place to challenge my adrenalin$$Thanks for your understanding everyone! It would be nice if the KTO had a little more power when it comes to the entertainment industry, so that we could give our fans a stronger voice. Maybe someday?$$KTO represents a wider scope (Kculture, Kentertainment, etc) but it would be very appreciated if it also has a strong voice. I hope your government will take note that Korea is being promoted heavily through its entertainment industry. And with what happened to JYJ (who was heavily promoting Jeju) , i don't think it a presents a good image of Korea, that it can just drop someone off at a very short unofficial notice. I still hope that this will be rectified asap.$$I like Spaland in Busan...totally amazing!! Really a good treatment after crazily jumping and crying in JYJ Busan Concert :-) Thinking getting back to Busan by end of this year to see the Maple, and of course to visit Spaland again (HEART) 

@KTO Thanks for your feedback as at least we know the messages are well delivered. It would be great if you can gather the comments and pass to the related government officials.

Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don‚Äôt welcome science. They didn‚Äôt provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport‚Äôs History.
That‚Äôs Why I Couldn‚Äôt to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!

I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.

The bridge is supported by 43 spans rising 41 meters above the sea. It has a large arch beneath which allows boats to pass. It was designed by engineer Arvin Valderama and Christian Meynard Barnal and constructed over San Juanico Strait from Cabalawan, Tacloban City to the municipality of Santa Rita, Samar in 1969.

Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.


Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name ‚ÄúBantayan sa Hari‚Äù (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to ‚ÄúBantayan,‚Äù the name it's known as today.

1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
By which also ye are saved, if keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

ROMANS 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

1 JOHN 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

God loves you so very much:))

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

1JOHN 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye believe on the name of the Son of God.

God loves you so very much! All of us are sinners in this world who have sinned and rebelled against a holy righteous God and because of sin we have to face death one day. Sin is the reason we die.God came down to earth as a man in the flesh named Jesus Christ. Jesus became the light of the world to save sinners from their sins. Jesus died on the cross for your sins, shed all of his blood, was buried, and rose again three days later, according to the scriptures. He took your place of punishment for your sins so if you truly believe in your heart on Jesus and all that he did for you and put your faith and trust in his blood that was shed for your sins and trust in all he did for you on the cross, you may know that you have everlasting life and you will be saved the very moment you truly believe in your heart. God sees the heart of man. Will you believe on Jesus Christ today with all of your heart and trust on him and the shed blood that was shed for your sins?

Jesus is God manifested in the flesh!!!

JOHN 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

JOHN 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to heaven! There is no other way. No man, priest, pastor, church, religion, works, baptism, nothing but through Jesus Christ!

JOHN 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

ACTS 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

JOHN 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

1 PETER 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

We are all sinners and we are going to die one day and need to be saved from our sins to go to heaven

ROMANS 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.

ROMANS 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

ROMANS 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROMANS 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

We are saved ONLY by GOD'S GRACE!

EPHESIANS 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

ROMANS 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

REPENT, turn to Jesus Christ, put your faith and trust in him alone, truly believe on him and all he did for you.

JOHN 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

MARK 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

EPHESIANS 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise,

When you truly believe on Jesus with all of your heart call upon him from your heart..Salvation is a heart decision and comes from the heart.

ROMANS 10: 9-13 If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

The very second you BELIEVE in your heart on Jesus Christ and all he did for you on the cross for your sins cause God sees your heart and call upon the name of the Lord from your heart you will be saved. Salvation is a heart decision..Whoever comes to Jesus Christ he will in no wise cast out..Come to Jesus today and  get saved today..",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I hope to win this Fantastic giveaway so that i can bring my bff to USS and have a thrilling and exciting new year eve !$$Liked and shared!
I wan to celebrate the new year with my best friends at uss! Me and my bestie did our o lvls this year we are quite nervous of the results which will be released in jan 2017. I also have a bestie who went to ite and due to us seperated, we didnt have time to catch up with one another. We didnt even went out tgt this year due to our busy schedules and important exams. I really wan me and my besties to be able to go out and have fun nd relax and talk abt times where we were still tgt in the same school, same class, talking abt the stupid things which we did tgt etc. I feel that uss is just the right place for it. We nvr been to uss in a longgggggg time. I know that most probably on that day there will be alot of people and the waiting times for the rides will be very long. During that time we can catch up with life and ask one another abt the life we live in now. Like how was school, have any new crush which they like and can tease them abt their crush hehe.. So we will spend the time wisely talking to one another instead of using the phone while waiting for our turn on the rides. And some of the attractions dun even allow u to bring any of your belongings with you! Speaking of those attractions, i also can get to see my friends' reaction on the rollercoasters and i will most probably lmao during the whole ride haha(we sure love to make fun of one another)! XD
 Really hope that i can win the tickets as i wan to bring the girls back tgt to spend a day tgt and to forgot our worries and to escape reality temporarily. (Thanks for taking your time to read this.)$$It'd be wonderful if I am able to go to USS with a precious Friend of mine and share the countdown moment together :) it's been a long way we've both come along and having recently graduated from high school it will be great for us to end this year with each other's company and look back at 12 years of friendship!!$$USS is somewhere every tourist will wanna go. but wait, there's actually singaporeans that haven been there... and thats me! haha main reason is because i cant bear to spend the money bcuz i have fear of heights. time to conquer my fears...... wimmmeeee! <3 Yongda Tan$$Liked and shared this post!
Answer: I want to win tickets to New Year's Eve Party at Universal Studios Singapore‚Ñ¢ because I want to experience and watch Tribute act performing the hits of Katy Perry, LED Street acts and performances and Pyrotechnics and multimedia shows. Since the Rides are open all night*, I should not miss this golden opportunity!!!$$I wish to win the tickets for celebrating my last moment of 2016 and my first moment of 2017 hanging out in USS and with my family which USS is not everyday open the park to midnight with all rides are open so I wish for a good memory with good place , good music , most fun day for my lifetime .......$$Always wanted to count down at somewhere unique and special! Cos i didnt get to countdown due to places being very crowded, but uss is the best way to countdown as able to enjoy rides and fireworks just like in a wonderland full of fun and laughter! A great way to start a new year right!üòÜ$$Liked & Shared! 
I hope to win the NYE tickets so that I can celebrate üéâ the 2017 with a big üí• bang and do the countdown in USS!
Hope to spend the happy moments with my family and have a unforgettable night! 
KeKe Xiao Hui$$Because I wanna share this festive season insanity with my besties Kimberly Meagan Ray Yoe and See Toh Jia Xin and taking the battlestar all night long sounds like the best way to do it and it's my favorite ride of course.$$I've never been to a countdown before and I would like to make 2016 special. With all that happened in 2016, ending it in USS with my family would be the best ending that I could I ask for. It's a unique place and also I can only imagine the fun we will all have there!$$Liked & shared! Would love to win this as i want to celebrate with my bf! He is in the army and we have very very limited time. Most of the time when he book out, we spent it with our little girl so it would be great if we could win this so we could have like a day out just the two of us! Haha as parents, all the time are given to our child so hopefully, i'll get to win this so i could take this oopotunity to go on a 'date' w him haha$$I wish to win for my family since school close we only go window shopping nearby..If i win  i can bring them to USS as they been wanting to go.If i am lucky i win i only need to buy for my others kids.Hope i can be one of the lucky winners. join me too Zaidi Aiman Nana Ana Aizat Zaidi$$The Dad of my boy is the most special person in my life. He's the sole breadwinner of the family and always working hard to provide us with what the family wants. He not only will help out in household chores, he also spent time bonding with family. 

He is busy with work but often show his love and concern through little things he do everyday, he would make me honey water everyday before he goes to work and would also make sure the flask is full so that we would have enough water for the day.

I really appreciate everything he has done for the family and would like to surprise him with a trip to USS so he could have some fun and enjoy on the NYE!!$$Liked and shared post!
I would like to win this as it is really special to have a countdown party in USS, USS is also one of my favourite place and furthermore I love all the exciting rides there. Some rides are open all night long which means I can ride in the dark and it will definitely be extraordinary experience for me!
Thanks for this awesome giveaway!$$Liked and shared! 

I want to win this pair of tickets as my bf and i are really enthusiasts of amusement parks.  I hope to spend the day counting down with him in a place that both of us have never visited, together. It would definitely be a first and super memorable as we chat about our resolutions and enjoy the night lights at USS and ride together!
Please make my wish come true!!! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ We would of course post lots of pictures too!!! 
Thank you :)$$Hello Smart Local. I am someone that lives for such cheap (ok la USS very expensive for students like me) thrills. So getting the opportunity to get on rides at 1.30am would be the best thing that'll ever happen to me in 2016. Besides that, NYE was never celebrated in my whole 19 years of existence. I'm considered 'too young' by my parents and I'm not allowed to club or start my year with a bang bc not halal. Hence, my parents would actually support the idea of me celebrating New Years getting 'mabuk' (drunk/dizzy in Malay) on rollercoaster rides than on vodka or beer. So, this is my shot at winning them tickets. üò¨$$Liked and shared! I wna win this coz i have been staying at home to countdown for the past few years.... I have no plans for this year's countdown as usual but really hope that I could celebrate the new year in USS this year!!! If not my last day of the year will be as boring as other years... :($$Liked and shared.
I really hope to win this so that I can bring my parents along, they have never been to USS nor hardly any other attractions cos of their working life from morning till night. I hope i will be able to make their new year more enjoyable and give them some time off to enjoy like they deserved. :')$$Liked and shared.

I hope to win the tickets as 2016 is really really a bad year. Hoping to get a spin on a roll coaster shout out to welcome 2017 (hoping it can be a better year)

Most importantly, to spend time and fun with loved ones on such an rare chance on their special opening hours :)$$Why I want to win? Are you kidding me??? It's like a childhood dream come true to stay overnight in a theme park!! Just hope I won't turn into Princess Fiona when the clock strikes 12! Haha!$$Keeping my fingers crossed that I will win as it will be a special unique night to spend new years eve at USS!!! Never had such a night experience before and definitely will be one to remember for years!! Liked and shared$$Liked and shared! Would like to win so I could end my 2016 on a bang by taking all the scream-worthy rides in USS! Besides, what is a better way to celebrate 2016 ending and 2017 starting than creating happy memories with the awesome shows and cute mascots?

He is actually an American. When he was born, he was given the name ""Bruce"" by his nurse.

How do I know? Hong Kong was a British Colony that was dominated by the Chinese, and most likely would not have had an English name.

Model: Sean Foo ","Brent Gan Heard the truffle broth was a new item so I went to try the other day.

They toss the noodles in the truffle oil, then they put it into the broth - which is mixed with the truffle oil beforehand. Double serving of truffle oil, topped off with truffle slices.

Heavenly stuff man.$$So so only. Noodle like Wanton Noodles, serving little, soup base not strong.

The one Leon said that the review scores are damn baseless. Aloysius Koh$$Had this 3 months back. My date hated the truffle ramen so much that she whispered for us to stop eating and head to 4 fingers next door. Definitely didn't make an impression bringing her to that ramen bar.$$lol wasnt this the ramen bar which was utterly s*** when we went?

If you can't use Google Maps to save your ass, Downtown Line 2 opening this December is just what you need. Here're 20 previously ulu places you can now explore with ease!

Thanks to Land Transport Authority ‚Äì We Keep Your World Moving, we can now say goodbye to tiresome walks under the hot sun! 

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/downtown-lineWith Downtown Line 2 opening this December, here are 20 previously obscure places you can now explore with ease!","Hi. Please take your photo which shows hikers going through a tunnel down. You give the impression that the tunnel is part of a hiking trail. It is not! This is a biking trail and NOT open to hikers (per NPark's directives). Bikes come down the tunnels in speeds in excess of 30km/h and will not be able to take evasive action if there is a hiker there. Showing this photo gives the impression that hikers can use this part of the trial and this can potentially cause injuries to both hiker and biker.$$The pictures taken at the foot of the tunnel under the dairy farm trail section is not part of the ""Wallace trail"". This is part of the bukit timah mountain biking trail. Hiking is illegal and dangerous on all mountain biking trails. 

Posing at the foot of the tunnel seems picturesque. But please note that bikers will come down this slope from your back at high speeds. The transition from light to dark (in the tunnel) will make it difficult for bikers to see anybody standing in the middle of the trail.$$Nice, except that the ""tunnel"" is part of a mountain bike only trail. Bikers will be zooming downhill through that tunnel, not expecting walkers to be on the trail.$$I guess if you were on a bicycle or motorbike for years, you would have been to most of these places.  Regarding MTB trails, I give up, groups and clubs of people playing radio control cars in them. Making movies, standing in the middle of the trail chatting. Here's some advice: don't ever block a trail, if you need to stop or chat, move to the side or stay off the trail.  Get on a bike and go trail riding, you will understand what we mean.$$https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nparks.gov.sg%2F~%2Fmedia%2Fnparks-real-content%2Flearning%2Flearning-journeys%2Fguided-walks%2Fdiy-guided-walks%2Fancient-forest%2Fdiy-trail-guide.pdf%3Fla%3Den&h=xAQEkvCX9

You may not want to introduce your readers to somewhere which they will risk  getting themselves injured. As what some have already replied below, that section in your photo IS a mountain biking trail.

And people are already ordering Jesa foods anyway...","I used to read AAKs Blog hoping to understand Korean culture better now that I am living here, but was disappointed at how often he  unfavorably talks about US of A. I believe that we should respect our differences and appreciate that they don't need to be labeled ""right"" or ""wrong.""$$Really? That's so sad to hear.„Ö†„Ö† I just saw the site today and thought it was an interesting concept. Wonder if I should remove it?$$I know! There were some really great blog posts and I followed the blog and facebook, too. But as the year passed I realized that I was upset by more posts than I enjoyed. Still, maybe I'm overly sensitive? Check out a few of his posts... he posts on a variety of subjects.$$I think the issue of sometimes critical opinions regarding america is something any expat of their country is bound to do with the country they've moved to. You notice a number of things- changes in courtesies, changes in formalities, food, discrimination, the list goes on. We went through this a lot in japan as exchange students- we had people that didn't want to sit next to us on occasion on the train, no one holds open doors in Japan (not out of an effort to be rude, but just because it's not part of their common courtesy), american versions of food outside of mcdonalds and hard rock were usually hilariously wrong, etc. We became very critical of Japan, not because we didn't like it there (we LOVED it there- many of my friends are already back), but because in talking through the harsh realities, it helped us cope and adjust to the differences. Many of our Japanese friends were slightly shocked at our perspectives on occasion, but they couldn't deny that there wasn't any truth to it. The Korea seems to do the same sort of thing, except this time the foreign country is america and america is full of changes he has to be critical of to understand and cope and adapt to. Perhaps I'm more understanding because I know where he's coming from, but instead of seeing it as a personal attack (which is far from what he probably intends), see it as an alternate perspective of someone who hasn't been ingrained in american culture since birth and therefore has a fresh perspective on perhaps some of the more harsher realities of living here. :)$$@Mary: Very insightful! I've seen both sides of it...people for the USA being very critical of Korea and many Koreans being critical of the USA. I think you may have hit the nail on the head...more than anything it may be a way to fit a new culture into their mindset more than an actual attack. However...there definitely is a limit too. I guess a lot depends on not just WHAT is said, but HOW it is said!$$^I agree! There are of course things you shouldn't say, but I've not seen anything written in this blog that seemed to absolutely cross the line with this sort of cultural reaction. I HAVE seen people cross it, and it's pretty obvious when they do. And generally most critiques about a country are kept amongst those who are collectively together in the new environment, not shouted from the rooftops, haha. The only time I had japanese friends of mine hear me speak about my own critiques is when I had to speak to a group of out-going american exchange students about what not to do and what to expect when going to Japan. Otherwise I don't generally talk about that sort of thing, haha. But since 'The Korean' has made an open blog about it, I can see how that might step on some toes of people who can't yet share the same perspective, but at the same time it's a good resource for learning relevant information from a down-to-earth point of view I think. :)",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

""Perhaps we should focus on what we have in common -- Singaporeans and Malaysians are united by a common love for food.""

Let's just appreciate each other's food okay!The long-standing debate has been reignited: Whose food is better, Malaysia's or Singapore's?

Some Malaysians online have said their food is better, and slammed a few classic Singapore dishes. This won't end well...

https://mustsharenews.com/malaysia-singapore-food/","So if Singapore's food is nicer, does that increase our GDP? So if Malaysia's food is nicer, do their citizens become richer? There are lots of bigger problems to worry about than to squabble over something stupid like whose food is nicer üôÑ$$I'm a half&half, both SG n MY food carries their own charisma. Good in their ways.

Even among Malaysians, coming from different states can have different tastebuds. 

Some prefer this, some prefer that.

Having said so, I never wan to order kway teow soup wen in SG. Too bland for me. But I can have kway teow soup in Penang everyday whenever I'm there. My last trip I even lug in 3 kg of kway teow from Penang wet market before my flight home to SG.$$It comes down to the fact that Malaysia gives you more bang for your buck. It can't be helped with their currency crashing past 3 to 1, they are just much better in value. Skill aside, for the same price, the portions are better, the materials used are better. We can't compete with the cheap ringgit nor should we really want to.$$Got nothing to do with money or the exchange rate. I'm Singaporean born and bred but having lived in Malaysia for 13 years, nothing compares to Malaysian food hands down. Mamak culture is amazing not just for the food but the company.$$'local food' wise, SG really out la. With the less salt less sugar less this and that health conscious shit. Tasteless AF. 
Well, some place do have nice crab beehoon, frog porridge and that's all. 
Wan tan mee, Char Kuey Teow, BKT Yada Yada all CMI. 
International food wise (hotel buffets, Japs, Kor) SG wins by light years even when compared with our capital KL. Honestly.$$Suggestion: Make 2 people eat only 1 of each version, all day every day, for a month. And then allow them to swap. Then ask again which is ""better"". üëç$$now herbal soup, bak kuet teh all taste like salt water. Lor Mee cooked by china cooks got smell no taste. chicken rice e rice so salty e meat very bland. if give me chance to try, i will try malaysia food. food cook by malaysian chinese cook is better. their taste and our very close.$$I love both versions of hokkien mee and bak ku teh. My most memorable chicken rice was 30 years ago at a restaurant in old Klang road. Didn't think it exist anymore.  Believe the secret is in the source of the chicken.$$Singapore better: chicken rice, kaya toast (because the price allows thicker butter), Chilli crab, noodle soup

Malaysia: everything else except the above$$The two countries were and still are tied by kinship and history and families values. Don't let the boundaries blur this valuable human comnection$$Wah.

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Batangas from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
The town of Anilao may not have white sand beaches, but its underwater environment is its biggest attraction. Dubbed as the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines, its deep waters teem with marine life and an abundance of corals and reefs. For non-divers ‚Äì the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

Fun Fact:
Diving conditions in Anilao are ideal for divers of all experience levels. The water temperature is consistently warm, and the surface is typically calm and smooth throughout the year.

I came here after meeting my fiancee in Korea. She was a missionary and I was an English teacher. I really wanted to explore‚Ä¶","Haha, living here in Makati, I agree with most of it. Cold showers were at first a rude awakening, my wife's house, no hot water or A/C (we married last year, I stayed instead of us moving to my country, she is self employed). The Provinces are beautiful. Still not used to the pail and bucket, T.P. is in the house :P. I am thanked when providing exact change.  People are friendly, but one must keep in mind in an area like Metro Manila, it also has elements all large Metro areas have, a criminal element and some pick out foreigners, reality, must be self aware. And will get stared at by a few lol. Security is everywhere, the malls, businesses. I like it. I give Philippines 5 stars.$$As peace corps volunteers in Leyte, we always filled the bucket up hours before our  'showers'  so that the water had a chance to warm up.  But sometimes it was so hot and humid that the cold water coming straight from the pipe sticking out of the wall felt great!$$it's really nice to read nice comments from foreign friends who have visited and is currently staying in our country, Philippines is totally far from other superpower countries where almost everything is advanced in technology, clean and so on... Philippines is still one of the 3rd world countries, poverty is still every where, living in the province is definitely something to try, though you really have to leave most of the luxury and convenience technology can give in place of fresh air, beautiful scenery, simple living, great people, and everything is cheap compared to city life in the metro!$$Another thing is some people do charge you more for some stuffs thinking that you are a foreigner but then change the rates when you speak Tagalog fluently. Other than that cool and friendly people.$$Philippines is a lovely country & nice place to live in ( much nicer if you have a bit of money - thats the reality about it )...I lived abroad for quite sometime now, but, I always think & longing to go home as much as possible in the Philippines ( as always they say...there's no place like home where most of your family, relatives & friends are)...I'm going home in a month time to the Phils. for just a Holiday/break...I can't wait.$$I don't care about the brown-outs, cold bucket showers, unreliable wi-fi....it's part of Filipino culture....bahala na.

Tam-Awan Village, Baguio

What is it like? 
Baguio City is a city on the Cordillera Central mountain range, which is 1,600 meters above sea level. The place is lined with pine trees, and has a subtropical highland climate with temperatures going down as low as nine degrees Celcius during the cool months of December, January and February. ""The Summer Capital of the Philippines"" can get a little crowded during March, April and May, when people from other cities come for a visit to escape the urban heat. 

Fun Fact: 
Tam-Awan was built to showcase a model village of authentic Ifugao huts, which are expertly constructed without the use of nails. The compact huts are elevated to shoulder level by four sturdy wooden posts. Tam-Awan is a popular tourist site in Baguio City not only for its huts, but also for its art galleries, annual art exhibits, workshops and cultural performances.

_______

Three months after kicking off 2016 with a social media contest, the Department of Tourism (DOT) announced on Friday, 19 February 2016, the three winners of the photo-fail challenge, each bagging a trip for two back to the Philippines. The contest encouraged foreign visitors to post their best photo-fails taken in the islands, highlighting their fun and candid experiences in the country.

Bannered under the theme ""Visit the Philippines Again 2016,"" this year's tourism campaign aims to attract repeat visitors and new travelers alike to come visit the country and relive the fun experiences they had with their friends, loved ones, and even strangers-turned-friends.

Photo-fail images submitted by Jarne Uytersprot from Belgium, Chintai Kato from Japan, and Kaisa Kapanen from Finland were chosen among thousands who submitted their photos. These photo-fails highlighted off-guard moments of tourists while having fun in the Philippines.

Launched at the World Travel Mart in London, England last November, the social media contest invited foreign passport holders who have been to the Philippines to upload their own photo-fail versions on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook with the official hashtag #visitphilippinesagain2016. Winners of the contest will get a chance to re-do their photos taken in some of the top vacation destinations in the country.

""This social media campaign was our way to heighten up the excitement for big events lined up for the Philippines this year. 2016 is the year of 'again' and 'Visit the Philippines Again' will once more highlight the country as a multi-level experience destination filled with exciting activities and endless new discoveries, shared with their warm and fun-loving hosts, the Filipino people,"" says Tourism Secretary Ramon R. Jimenez, Jr.

Among the big events lined up this year are the Routes Asia 2016, Madrid Fusion Manila 2016, Flavors of the Philippines, Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2016, 2016 Ironman 70.3 Asia Pacific Championship, MTV Music Evolution 2016, the World Street Food Congress, and the Travel Blog Exchange (TBEX). The recent months also witnessed the Philippines' hosting of the ASEAN Tourism Forum in Manila and the World Eucharistic Congress in Cebu.

This challenge will be valid to the end of 2016 and the full terms and conditions of the challenge will be in the participation and filming consent forms.
