""THE LEGEND SATAY SINCE 1952 AT BANDUNG""
West Java. Indonesia

Sate Kambing Hadori can be regarded as a living legend in the culinary specialties of Bandung that still exist today. So do not be surprised if this sate echo has echoed to the entire city of Bandung, even outside the city. So famous, to the extent that there is an anecdote that later developed in the community Bandung that if there are people named Hadori it will be then referred to as a handyman satay. Sate Kambing Hadori certainly have not name any names, but typical culinary symbol and at the same time struggle to exist.

Sate kambing is part of the cuisine of Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. It is very popular in the country, especially in Java. Sate kambing is the Indonesian name for mutton satay, since it is made of goat meat. This food is made by roasting goat meat that has been mixed with seasoning. A set of Sate Kambing usually consists of the satay itself, complemented by a sauce made of soya sauce or peanut sauce. Some people eat it with rice while others prefer to eat it with traditional rice box named lontong or ketupat. In some areas sate kambing is sold together with another popular food named gule kambing (goat soup). Sate can also be made by other meat e.g. meat of buffalo, chicken, fish, and others.

Clearly, if a culinary tour in the city of Bandung, do not miss to stop by the Sate Hadori

Temples are beautiful and lots of mountains and parks around the country you can enjoy. It is a very safe place to travel around and cities have also interesting vibes and stuff going on.Korea is almost completely mountainous. Where the cities end, the mountains begin,I admire the way South Korea developed itself, it was a very poor country not so long ago.I want to visit south korea as just for the opportunity to experience a culture that is so different from our western cultures. Korea, even if it is a small country, has its unique culture, where traditions and innovations, old and new coexist. I would love to see  Haemieupseong Fortress, Rock-carved Triad Budha, Gaesimsa Temple .i want to see the 600 yr old hoya tree .i want  to take my  time in savoring the tranquility of this picturesque temple. Vasant Bokadia Gautam Jain Soni Shashi Hastimal Jain$$I would love to visit the birth place of Catholicism and learn about the beginning of Catholicism in Korea so Solmoe Holy Ground in Dangjin would be my  place of choice and I would take Kamoy Mclean Anna Marlok and Andrea Danciu with me <3 !!~$$I would love to take a break away from the busy city and visit the temples in Seosan Chungcheongnam-do  and also the Ganwoldo island with Nima Mudey, Rebecca and Rezwana Latif$$Definitely I want to visit Haemieupseong Fortress and Gaesimsa Temple with Aneta, Amby and Rochelle, Let's do it and travel to one of the most amazing country in this world!$$I love Korea but not just Korean I love all sorts of Asian cultres and one thing that I really like about Korea is the food, music, clothes, people, language. I love Kpop too but you people shouldn't bash people for liking or ""worshiping"" the singers that why there called ""Kpop idols"" and there is more music to Korea than Kpop. I hope one day I get to visit over there and see things like there Buddhist shrines and some of there Malls (Dongdaemoon, Namdaemoon, ETC.) Korea is a nice place and people  love it because Korea has a lot to offer! i have 2 reasons why i wanted to go there: 1) they are pretty much a ""green"" environmental community. 2) it's the technology capitol of the world!! moreover they seem to have the best looking people within asia from shows and things I've watched. But this is because beauty is something that they value over talent in so many entertainment industries. would love to visit as its my dream destination.e to see suncheon bay as Suncheon Bay is home to countless plants and marine life .i want to see Suncheon Bay Reed Festival that  is held every year in October, and ive heard that the bay is just as beautiful and charming any other month of the year.. as i love marine life it wud interest me much.  Vijaya Sakhala  Chandrakala Mutha Hemant Kataria Kavita Bokadia Gyan Jain$$Although I was in Korea more then 10 times, unfortunately I have never been inside the Myeongdong Cathedral and I have not been to Seosan city. I thinks it is a city with a very long history starting from Baekje period. But of course there are much more places which I have not seen yet. Recently many foreigners visit Seoul but for many non-Asian foreigners the biggest attraction is a countryside, Buddhist temples, places that coloured with oriental beauty, not the contemporary midernity, although DDP is gourgeous as well. Let's go see Korea one day together Наталья Похолкова Daria Nevskaya Иван Сиротин$$I guess Seosan is the place to be. Seems so beautiful! I want to go there with my lovely friends Mirella NavaJesse GamboaReinna Marie Ang 洪正蕾 . stamp tour seems neat too.. :)$$It was truly amazing to know that our Pope Francis will be visiting Korea.

These are some of the most raw confessions we've seen from Singaporean guys who had their hearts shattered to a million pieces.From catching their gfs red-handed at Hotel 81 to finding out through texts, 10 Singaporean guys share their ex-periences with us. 

https://zula.sg/singaporean-guys-cheated/","From my experiences most sg ladies are just playing hard to get. To them sincerity and a true heart ranks second to money and status. 

They are never satisfied with their other half. Constantly comparing their own partner with their friends's. When they see their girlfriends doing well and being constantly pampered by their bfs, they feel super envious and expect no less for themselves.

And when they realized that they could no longer feel good among their fellow girlfriends, they would have a change of heart easily. They could never take abit of hardship and would just ""abandon ship"" when storms come. In short they could never stand by their man. 

Materialism and hankering a life of pampering and comfort is the cause of it all. Its sad. For some of them they will always wonder why they always can't have / sustain a relationship but they would never look at the mirror and ask themselves :""So am I the cause and problem?""$$Basically these guys just go for the girls' looks mostly  so I think they deserve to get their hearts broken.  If they had really looked carefully and got to know the girls well, they would know who are the fakes and those who are really worth their time. So go figure.$$Really good hearted girls may not look like a million dollars all the time because most of them are busy earning their own salaries and taking care of their aged parents.  But once they get committed, they sacrifice their love, time and money nurturing that relationship. So those guys who only look for appearances   I still think they deserve the ""superficial"" girls that come with high maintenance and a truckload of  complaints ! :) haha$$The thing is a guy gets labelled an asshole when he cheats. But girls are always let off. Somehow even being defended by her friends and male friends also with reasons saying she had a reason to cheat. Puikkkk. Cheaters are disgusting. Just beacuse men dont talk much abt it doesn't mean we don't have feelings.$$Well guys have feelings too.

What is it like? 
Makati City is one of the most urban cities in the Philippines, filled with tall office buildings, shopping centers, and entertainment hubs. There’s no place for boredom here. You’ll always find it bustling with lights, sounds, and conversations.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Fun Fact: 
The city is actually a location for a world record: The Guinness World Record for the Biggest Fashion Show. Over 2,000 professional and amateur models walked down runways sporting designs from the best of the country’s fashion brands.

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University’s Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Best Regards
Yours Cordially

Magellan's Cross, Cebu 

How to Get There:
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. 

Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

What is it?
Magellan's Cross commemorates Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan's first contact with the people of Cebu on April 7, 1521. 

Fun Fact:
The original cross is actually encased within the planted wooden cross you see today, as a precaution against locals who chipped off small pieces for their rumoured healing properties.

One signboard with too many confusing inforaiton. And the Heading is: INFORMATION. And that is the only legible word.  KTX ticking is another big confusion: no return tickets, foreigners need to be a MEMBER to get discount (who cares to be a MEMBER?), and schedules all in Hangul, and ticket office no one speaks English. SUNCHEON Bay was high on my agenda. But I dropped the idea because moving around in Korea is pretty painful. Maybe I will drive my relative's car down south next time. I am not here to Spike Korean Toursim Board. But you really have to put your act together to improvement tourism in Korea. No wonder Tourist only know Seoul and Busan, and miss out ALL OTHER cities in Korea. Putting Sun Cheong here is meaningless, because for an enthusiastic tourist like me, (even if I read Hangul), its too painful to get from Seoul to Sun Cheon, and a risk of getting stuck in Sun Cheon with no hotel/motel to stay overnight.$$Yes indeed!

The f1.8-2.8 aperture is THE key feature that will help in my food photography to achieve that bokeh effect our iPhone cameras cannot do, when Kevin and I explore the many cafes all over Singapore!😊 He has been saying we should get a DSLR to take better shots of our food (because our cameras eat first😋), but who wants to lug a bulky and heavy DSLR camera around on dates?!🙄 This SONY Cyber-shot camera is the perfect solution🤗 And, SONY cameras have come a long way! My first digital camera was from SONY- I definitely share an affinity with and trust this brand!😁$$Listing only one key function of SONY's Cyber-shot™ DSC-RX100M4 doesn't do justice to this pocket size friendly camera! Known for its superspeed potential, it's packed with impressive features like an F1.8-2.8 aperture, a ZEISS® Vario-Sonnar T* 24-70mm lens, and shutter speeds of up to 1/32,000 of a second, it takes DSLR quality pictures without the bulk! Indeed an award-winning camera and so apt for girls like me who don't carry a big bag around 👍🏼🙆🏻 Being in this advanced technology century, where everyone is looking for WIFI on the go, having a built in WIFI in this beauty is a plus! Because it allows me to post any photos easily on the go onto my Instagram without having to transfer the photos to a desktop/laptop. How not to love this compact beauty? 😍 I hope I can win this and start posting more Instagram worthy photos😉 Thank you TSL!$$Love the big aperture to F/1.8. Make this camera perfect for food photography. The lens and also the shutter speed of 1/32,000 really make this camera a powerful little treasure to capture the precious moments! 

Just simply love love love it!$$Liked and shared.

RX100M4 has a F1.8-2.8 lens which make my photo Bokeh-licious (creating a very shallow depth of field), also the high ISO allow me to take supreme night shot with low noise. The high shutter speed of 1/32000sec allows me to capture sharp images when performing high speed photography. I believe this camera will help me in photography as I am love bokeh photography and night shot.$$The low aperture available with the Cybershot DSC-RX100M4 will allow me to take amazing pictures of food that has different layers, which happens that most of them are my favourites; think bingsoo, pancakes, cakes and waffles. Yay for desserts, will the cybershot camera, I can nail these with a great depth of field behind the food photograph. Cheers to instaworthy food pics. Thanks the smart local 🙌🏻$$SONY's Cyber-shot™ DSC-RX100M4 has so many impressive features and i especially love the shutter speeds of up to 1/32,000 of a second, perfect for capturing high quality pictures even when moving around! This camera is light and compact enough that i can easily bring it with me on my backpacking trips. :)$$As a hipster cafes lover, I've encounter some difficulties in taking nice food pictures especially lighting issues. With DSC-RX100M4, I'm more ready to upload into Instagram since the one-inch sensor in the lightweight and nifty camera is good for snapping photos in low light environment. And also, the weight and photo quality blew my mind. What's more could i ask.

The wifi sharing functions is useful for cafes lovers because I'm able to share all the on the table projects/Flat lay photos on social media such as Instagram.$$Liked and shared! I love compact the slim SONY's Cyber-shot™ DSC-RX100M4 is. That not only makes it easy and convenient to carry around for daily uses and at the same time we don’t have to compromise on the quality of the shots taken unlike other compact cameras. DSLR quality photos can be easily produced with this camera, just how great is that? Another favourite would be the 180 degree tilting LCD screen with that, there’ll never be blurry & pixelated selfies! Yay. Love how Sony manages to squeeze such amazing features and functions into such a small frame. :) Jian Sheng TheSmartLocal.com Sony Mobile SG Sony Mobile$$Liked and shared☺️☺️☺️ I've always faced difficulties in taking nice food pictures because of lighting issues and now I no longer enjoy taking pictures of food bec all the pictures just don't turn out nice. However, the one-inch sensor in the light and nifty camera is the best for capturing photos in low light, helping me to combat dimly-lit restaurants or cafes. Such a compact and light camera sounds like my best pal, simply just pop it into my bag and I'm ready to head out with my girlfriends. The wifi is definitely something to look out for because I'll then be able to share pictures on social media with my friends almost instantaneously❤️❤️❤️ I've been looking out for a compact and light camera without compromising all the features and I've seemed to found the perfect one! Hope to win this so that I can this new toy outfit some fun 💯💯💯💯💯💕$$I love its wireless capability and  compact size! I'm personally not a professional photographer, but I definitely love snapping candid photos on the go! (these are the best photos, aren't they!! 😁) The high shutter speed is thus really handy for a noob like me! 🤗 Woohoo!$$I love its 1 inch sensor which will help me capture much better quality photograph at night than using a mobole phone as i absolutely like to take photographs of the countless scenic view in the night. Furthermore, these 1-inch sensor that aids the high speed photography will definitely help me in sports photography which is also one of my greatest interest$$To be plain honest, having this compact Cyber-shot RX100M4 will become my ""bring-around"" camera. Personally as a film maker, i like to rubberneck at people's life, but it's impossible to bring my big DSLR or cameras around. This camera could help capture moments and also assist my ""photographic mind"".$$It is an excellent choice especially during travelling and hiking. The weight and video/photo quality just crushes and blow the competition out of the water! You cannot find any other camera with such ridiculous nice shots for this size.

The video and photo quality at this size is just insanely good. It is comparable to dslr but at such a small size that fits conveniently into your pocket. 

The wifi sharing functions is excellent for sharing your media content as soon as you take them and share it with your friends online on your social media such as instagram, facebook and youtube.$$Liked and shared the post! I love the fact that the camera will be able to take good photos in low light as this is definitely something I know my phone (yup I can't do without my phone's camera but there's only so much it can do at night haha) can't achieve! I would love to take photos that captures the mood and lighting at that time so it can recreate the ambience just by looking at the photo! Plus it's so compact, I can bring it around without having too lug a big bag around! :)

Really hope to win this for my sister as she has been longing for a camera for her upcoming exchange programme! Can't wait for her to share her amazing photos with us while we are stuck here in sunny sg! Talk abt the convenience of the wifi function 😉$$The sleek body enable me to carry out in my bag and the camera act like a DSLR. With the feature of capturing better quality picture in low light setting, this definitely help in capturing nicer picture in a low light setting restaurants or environment. Then I can upload my picture immediately to instagram with the in-built wifi!$$The ability of this pocket-friendly and sleek camera to capture quality photos in even low light is extremely appealing! Moreover, this seems highly convenient to carry around for people who are always on-the-go and would like to do so without the extra weight of a conventional DSLR. :)$$Liked and Shared! If you ask me what my favourite function of the SONY Cyber-shot Camera, it would definitely be the Super High Speed function in which I can take perfect candid photos of people around me. I love taking candid photos of people as these photos are usually the ones which show the real emotions of people at that moment. With this function I would definitely be able to take super clear and photos of high quality!$$SONY's Cyber-shot™ DSC-RX100M4 is a powerful compact camera which is super convenient for me to carry around during my mandatory weekend adventure. Extremely suitable for Instagram addicts like me!

One of my favorite function would probably be the Aperture. With Aperture as low as f1.8, I'll be able to achieve sharp and define bokeh photos!

MOST IMPORTANTLY..... All its incredible features made it suitable for all occasions, anytime and anywhere! Say no to all ugly and blurry photos and welcome a new generation of clear and sharp photography! ALL HAIL SONY!$$Love the compact size of this camera which doesnt compromise on its photo quality! The size makes it so convenient and is a camera which i wont be too lazy to bring out as compared to those bulky dslrs.$$I have never own a professional camera before so actually all the functions from SONY Cyber-shot are what I need to be able to snap my memories and help me to fulfill my dream of starting up my own YouTube channel! ☺️$$Liked and shared! Love that the camera is handy, and able to capture photos sharp and clear. It really matters when taking photos of food, every detail matters! 😊$$The 180-degree tilting LCD screen would allow me to take photos of a subject from a variety of angles, which makes it more interesting! The one-inch sensor means better photo in low-light condition. :)$$The in-built wifi for sure... What's the point of Instagram if I'm going to have to go home, transfer from the SD card when the moment's over? It's going to be great also for me to shoot my two furry kids with bokeh, giving it that dreamy look~~~$$Liked and shared !! 

I love the low aperture capability. It's absolutely crucial especially in low light conditions in indoor locations.

Guyam is a small deserted island of the coast of Siargao near General Luna. The island is visited daily by visitors on a boattrip or who come to just chill out for a while. It's a perfect little island with no facilities exept a toilet and 2 shelters. For a small fee the owner will allow people to stay on the island overnight. I've been in Siargao for over 2 months, the vibe of the island and the beauty of the surrounding islands make Siargao and incredible and addicting island. For a while have I been planning the right time to visit this island during the time when the milky way would be visible ánd when there would be no light pollution of the moon, also trying to lucky with clear weather. 

The milky is not visible like this with your own eyes, it is because of long exposure shots (20 seconds) that details of the milky way become visible and with postprocessing details and contrast are further enhanced. The settings used are ISO 1600, f2.8, shutterspeed of 20seconds. I used a D800 and 14-24mm lens, but any DSLR can capture this and even a good compact camera with RAW abilities.

Master trainers of cormorants dressed in ancient costume freely manipulate 10-12 wild sea cormorants to skillfully catch small trout.

There are actually many different and original cover designs depending on the area. If you pay attention to them, you may come across some interesting ones.

This one is from Yamanakako Lake, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The design features Mt. Fuji and swans, which Yamanakako Lake is famous for.

When traveling Japan, be sure to check out the different manholes and try to find especially interesting ones!
Or do you already have a favorite?

Seafood, especially crab, is one of the most vibrant and famous cuisine in Indonesia since it has so many islands which are surrounded by sea. So everytime I eat seafood here, it will reduce my homesickness. Crab is also my favorite food, it already tastes good without any seasoning. So I can't imagine how it will taste in soys-marinated sauce. I guess it will taste fantastic!

I suggested 'Gwamegi' (과메기) for you guys. When the winter season starts, one of my senior from Pohang gave me gwamegi. It is a famous half-dried fish which mostly eaten in the region of North Gyeongsang Province. My senior told me, we can only eat this kind of fish in winter season because it needs to be repeated freezing-defreezing outdoors. It tastes sweet, sour, rough, a little bit spicy; all in the same time. It is perfect to be consumed with garlic, chili, vinegared red pepper paste, wrap them around dried seaweed, and accompanied by a bottle of soju or beer. 🤤

Cc: Wendy William Christian Chandra Marcel Hidajat Winarto Hermawan Prajitno Aldo Pollardo Vincent Wirawan$$My Korean friend brought us to taste Sundae Soup on our first visit to Korea in 2012. Had Ddeokbokki and other street foods at Pochangmacha in Jeju for our dinner. Then we went to Gwanjang Market in 2014 to eat Sundae and Gopchang. For Hongeo, it's an accident for me... because Jeonju Makgeolli House served all sort of excotic foods as anju (안주) to consumed with Makgeolli. To be frank, if I knew it's Hongeo I won't eat it. It's an accident as I thought it's hoe (회). As a sashimi lover, I just put the whole slice inside my mouth. The aftermath was horror to my mouth... really shocking experience to mouth, my tongue and my nose! Stinky ammonia smell like public toilet was really unbearable. I had to drink makgeolli and haejangguk to cleanse and purify contaminated area by the smelliest food I ever had in my life.😱😱😱  My hubby ate the Snails and Beondegi too. He had tasted Beondegi at Soraepogu Fish Market and he said it tasted nice. But, knowing that it's silkworm pupa I just too hesitate to put it inside my mouth unless I'm drunk~! Maybe I'll challenge myself to eat this Beondegi and Sannakji next time! 😶$$I would say Beondegi but I tried that last November during my #VisitKorea trip beside the Cheonggyecheon stream so in April I'd like to try the Hongeo 😍. i expect this to be a little slippery but tasty. I am so looking forward to it.$$I would like to challenge myself with this....Cheonggukjang AKA “Dead Body Soup”. They say its odor is so strong and repellant to many. The soybean paste used for this soup is only briefly fermented, which means that much of its strong ammonia smell remains. It has largely whole soy beans which stick together with a slimy, gluey substance. But, despite the dreadful description and smell,they say it's incredibly delicious. Victor Valle Otero$$I would try them all, but since I have to chose only one, I think I'll side with Dak Bal. I also like pig feet and reeeallyyy spicey things, so it would be similar I think. Alsooo, I want to try bingsu so much... it's not as special as the others on this list, but those look absolutely delicious.$$I want to challenge myself with these two korean foods which are Maeun Ddeokbokki and Ganjang gejang. First, I want to try the one which is the Maeun Ddeokbokki. I saw this food in one of the korean drama. The first time I saw this food was I already think that this food was really good. I want to challenge myself to eat more spicy food like this spicy rice cake because I want to try to eat rice cake with mix of chili sauce. The one thing really good to this food is its easily purchased from street vendors anytime you want to eat this. 

             Since Im young I really like seafoods that's why Im anticipated to try Ganjang gejang because I want to try new taste and new meal beside of fried crabs. I want to eat this dish that made by raw crabs marinated in soy sauce. I will eat this crab meat with rice even with my bare hands until the last bite of it. 

        I recommend to others to try the stir-fried jjukkumi that marinated in red chili sauce because it has a great taste and good for health.$$안녕하새요.. I would like to challenge both 간장게장 (soys – marinated crab) and 닭발 (chicken feet) dish .. I would love to try  닭발 because I once saw Apink Chorong eating it on Apink Showtime and for 간장게장 , I fell in love for it when I saw Running Man member eat it on the show. There are various type of Korean dish that often shown on Korean dramas and reality shows. 
This event is good because it can introduce unique Korean dish to non Koreans. Based on my experience, I would like to recommend 떡볶이 (tteokbokki) for those who craving for late snack and tteokbokki cheese for those like less spicy food. And for those that want challenges, eat Beongdegi (번데기) (steamed silkworm larvae). 감사함니다 ~ <3$$I would try a few. The sundae (blood sausage). Gopchang (intestine) Hongeo  (skate) and Ganjang gejang  (soy marinated crab) sounds amazing. I actually have had maeun ddeobkbokki (spicy rice cake) I love spicy food but it was too hot for me.$$I would like to try 떡볶이 (ddeokbokki)!! I'm really in love with kdramas and this meal is very popular among them...I love spicy food and ive been told that ddeokbokki can be spicy so that sounds great.....

Another meal I would like to try but also i would recommend is ""heotok"" wich is the korean version of pancakes, right?? So thats it (theres a lot of meals Id Like to challenge like ""bulgogi"" or ""jajjamyeon"" i expected both to look and be appetizing)

Cant wait to try them all~~!!$$I would like to taste the Sannakji because this is what I am looking for when visiting Korea, to see and taste things I could not anywhere else. Seafood is what is not avaible everywhere. And if I like it, then the ganjang gejang can come. 🙂$$When I visit Korea one day I really want to try kimchi. I know it's not on the list but I love cabbage and fermented cabbage just sounds delicious. I am so curious about the street food there.$$I think Dwejimori, Ojingeochae, Bosintang and Onnuriye Donkatsu are challenging enough, but maybe with enough Makgeolli they will be just fine. 짠!$$I'd like to take on the Dak bal (chicken feet) challenge. I expect it to be gut-twisting spicy but my skin would glow from all the collagen I ate.$$탕탕이!!! 
I really want to try 육희낙지탕탕이!!  Minced raw beef and nakji with raw egg. Been wanted to try it since I watched Eric oppa made it on three meals a day.$$It'll be hard but I want to challenge Beondegi and Hongeo. They both are known to have strong smells so it'll be a hard challenge :)$$I would challenge the ganjang gejang. I'm not really big on sea food but crab marinated in soy sauce doesn't sound too bad !$$I would to try Beondegi (Pupa) ^^ After watch my friend's video about challenge to eat beondegi, i really curious about the taste, is it yummy ?? ㅋ But i think i'm so scared to eat it .. In Indonesia, we know about the food like beondegi, but we can't find it easily like in Korea. And yeah it full of protein and vitamin, i think i should eat beondegi as snack at my office if i'm feel so hungry 😂
Let's watch my friend's video ⬇
https://youtu.be/VQdEbmw-hW4

And i would to recommend Onnuriye Donkatsu (Pork cutlet). Just see this photo and you can feel the hoooooottttt ~~~ I really don't like spicy food but i would to try this one, maybe just a little 😅

If you want to try this, you can find at Onnuriye Donkatsu, 355-23 Sindaebang 2-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul; +82 2 823 8589

Thank you Korea Tourism Organization - VisitKorea for this event, so we can share about Korean food and get more new information about many Korean food 😁❤ #VisitSeoul #VisitKorea$$I would like to try Hongeo! I just simply want to know how bad it smells like.$$Challenge Accepted!
I would like try Dak Bal (Spicy chicken Feet). I really really like spicy foods. It's very temptating and make your body hot especially in the winter like now. In Nepal, we can find many nepalese spicy food but I would like to try it. I like the spicy food and it makes the food very delicious and make me sweat if i eat that. I like Korean Food because it's very delicious, flavour, spicy and have a unique taste. So i really really want to taste Dak Bal if i visit to 'Korea'. And taste in street food market like i watch it in K-Drama or any vlogs, it makes me so temptating 😋😋😋 #Korea_Food #Food_Lovers #VisitKorea ✌$$I would like to try 순대 when i visit to Korea. My friend tell me actually it is really taste good so i wish to challenge it when i go to korea =)

WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT #MIRIAM TOO ?

This election is not a show for personalities. This is not a show for entertainment. This is a show that will lead the future of our country and all the lives of Filipinos for years to come.

Miriam is battling lung cancer. It is a fact. Miriam is sick. Miriam may die anytime. But, just like all men, Binay, Poe, Duterte and Roxas may die also anytime. Miriam is just sick, but remains highly capable. Everyone knows that on the basis of qualification, all candidates, except Miriam remains on top. It is a fact.

Miriam ran in 1992 for president. She won the votes, but lost in the counting. Cory Aquino's ally Fidel Ramos won. Miriam did not surrender the fight. She ran as senator of this republic. She worked hard as legislature. She has been an RTC Judge, Agrarian Secretary, Immigration Commissioner, and United Nations ICC Judge. 

Miriam has no ""City"" to base her competence. And Miriam has no 3-6 month-worth of promises. But, she has all her bills, laws, and track records to prove her worth. Decades ago, before the rise of Duterte, Poe, Binay and Roxas, Miriam has been the Master of Anti-Corruption and Anti-Crime. She was there since then and until now. 

Unlike other presidential candidates, even Miriam lost once, she is still now trying to succeed the Presidential race in 2016. This is a symbol of #persistence and #perseverance. This is the will to win!

This country needs a #wise president to decide where this country will be heading. We need a leader who has a strong conviction and philosophy. We need a leader who has law and governance #expertise. We need a leader who can be a #model to all members of the society especially the youth. We need a leader who has the capability to handle #international concerns. We need a leader who is respected by majority not because of his dictatorial skills, but because of his #wisdom to steward this republic. 

We need a leader who has #academic, #professional and #moral#excellence. We need a leader like #Miriam. 

We need a leader with #decency, #quality, #professionalism and #integrity. #credibility, #Dignity,  #honest.  Strong,  Brave and Bold ! Intellectually Brilliant Leader! WORLD  CLASS LEADER!

We need Miriam. 

Why would you vote for someone ""lesser evil"" or someone ""good enough"" if there is someone like ""best choice."" 

Why would I vote for Duterte, Roxas, Binay, or Poe, if there is Miriam. 

Why would I settle for ""siya na ang iboboto ko kahit na ganun siya"" if there is something like 
""Siya ang iboboto ko kasi siya ang talaga ang tama at dapat.""

Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name “Bantayan sa Hari” (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to “Bantayan,” the name it's known as today.

What is it like? 
Club Paradise Resort is surrounded by a house reef which is easily accessible to divers and has a diverse marine system. Near this reef is the feeding ground of sea turtles and dugongs (sea cows) – the gentle giants of the sea. There are tours that take you along the coast of Busuanga for some dugong-watching.

Fun Fact: 
Some believe that stories of mermaids came about when lonely sailors spotted dugongs swimming in the ocean, and mistook their shape as that of half-woman, half-fish creatures.

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Cavite from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
It only takes a day to hike Mt. Pico de Loro. Though it's only 664 meters above sea level, the trail to the summit is difficult, but rewarding. Nestled in Ternate, it offers a view of mountainous landscapes and nearby islands. The best part is it’s only three hours away from Manila.

Fun Fact:
During the Spanish era, Mount Pico de Loro was a Filipino rebel’s camp and watch tower.

Rather, people give them to their family members, friends and coworkers. Tourist shops are filled with colorful boxes of local sweets and “Made in Japan” products.

Calle Crisologo, Vigan

What is it?
Calle Crisologo is considered the Philippines' most beautiful street. It's paved with cobblestones and lined with well-preserved Spanish ancestral homes. Strolling along this part of Vigan is like traveling back through time. Kalesas (horse-drawn carriages) are also common sightings. And you can even ride on one for a full-on blast-from-the-past experience. Calle Crisologo is one of the five places in the Philippines that have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Fun Fact:
An urban legend in Vigan tells the story of a Japanese general who fell in love with a Filipina who lived there. He married her, and they had a family. To protect them, he promised the parish priest that he would save the town from being destroyed by the war if the priest would keep his family safe.

Magellan's Cross, Cebu 

How to Get There:
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. 

Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

What is it?
Magellan's Cross commemorates Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan's first contact with the people of Cebu on April 7, 1521. 

Fun Fact:
The original cross is actually encased within the planted wooden cross you see today, as a precaution against locals who chipped off small pieces for their rumoured healing properties.

Hi Helen, it is possible to rent an international taxi at the airport (there are booths inside the airport near by the arrival gates). However, I wonder if four people's luggage would be easily stored in a taxi. If you find that there is enough space and the cost for 4 bus tickets is similar to a taxi it might be okay.

If not, you might want to just take an airport bus like the one featured here. There will be buses going to Insadong, you can just ask at the ticket counter.$$Hi, KTO, thanks. We have no luggage when arrived, just 1 carry bag each. Do the bus/taxi service person speak English or Chinese.

3. http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/todai-buffet - This MBS international buffet is pricey but worth it if you enjoy seafood and good Korean/Jap alongside your meal. It's started by a Korean dude and the restaurant even attracts Korean pop-stars.

4. http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/sumiya-orchard-central - You MUST look out for the discount brochure if you're thinking of heading here. Food is fresh flown directly from Japan three times a week.

Rice pounding is a Filipino custom still done in many small, rural villages. Pounding the rice allows the seeds to be released from their husks.

Fun Fact:

Many guys just admire pretty girls from afar, hoping they could talk to them. Picking up girls is an intricate art, but we got it down to a science. Here's something new from our ""Talking to Strangers"" series.


Our aim is simply to help more Singaporeans meet each other, so they have more options and find more suitable partners for themselves. But this guide is not for everyone. If just the thought of girls being 'picked up' offends you, please don't read it.


Remember, the golden rule is to always be a gentleman. Be as transparent as you can, respect her and remember that she is your equal.

http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/pick-up-girls-sgMany guys just admire pretty girls from afar, hoping they could talk to them. Picking up girls is an intricate art, but we got it down to a science. Here\'s how.","There are so many things I could say about this article but I will limit them to the ones I can articulate well in the short amount of time I have. In an article entitled ""how to pick up girls"" promoting the woman as ""equal"" and not a ""prey' is mind-boggling if not shocking. As a woman, I am not sure how to feel, upset or pleased. Secondly, if the motive of the article is to ""find suitable partnerships"" I am not sure your title and some of the recommended tips, some of the language used is achieving the purpose. I  normally enjoy your postings, however, (as a recently returned Singaporean to Singapore and a humanitarian) if this describes in  nutshell how the  courtship processes begin then it speaks volumes (not heart-warming ones) about the moral and social fabric of the society. As an influential source that I'd like to believe your website is, I'd love to see ways of reforming this pretty sorry state.$$Ben Tan haha you know I find this article funny. I find this whole thing funny. Women preach equality and independance and strength.. you know what I wanna see? For once I'd like to see a girl with balls--yes BALLS--big enough to walk up to a guy she likes and talk to him. Not just stand there like some sexual butterfly giving out pheromones like she's queen bee. And while she's at it, how bout she pay for her own damn first date because chivalry is a girl's worst expectation. The guy doesn't even know if you're worth it and yet he's paying for you?! TIMES HAVE CHANGED PEOPLE. Foot your own bill, talk to guys, stop eye-fucking them, and for goodness sake don't expect a guy to impress you because he doesn't need your requirements of him. He doesn't need you to tick off your checklist in your pretty little heads because he actually loves from the heart. Wanna be equal? Here's a formula for you. LOVE IS A TWO WAY STREET. It's not about picking up girls. It's tough love people, deal with it.
Yours Sincerely

What is it like? 
A lot of traditional villages can be found scattered throughout the rice terraces. Visit the Tam-an, Bocos, Batad, and Bangaan villages to immerse in the culture of this region.

How to get there: 
Take a bus bound for Banaue from Sampaloc. 

Or take a bus bound for Baguio from Cubao or Pasay, then transfer to a bus bound for Banaue.

Fun Fact: 
If you were traveling in the Philippines, you’d most likely be carrying the Banaue Rice Terraces in your pocket. The image of the site can be found at the back of the new P20 bill.

If you are visiting Kuala Lumpur anytime soon, may we recommend Restoran Sate O'Mulia.

Located at a busy intersection between Jalan Tun Razak and Jalan Semarak, this restaurant is popular among locals. the coals are furiously fanned to give a fiery flame upon which the satays are grilled to give them a charcoal smoke aroma, caramelised sugar & fat combo hence crispy chunks of meat on the outside with juicy insides. 

The taste is divine. :)

Address:
300-1 Jalan Tun Razak, 54200 Kuala Lumpur

From 6.00pm - 11.00pm. closed on Sundays.

Mt. Apo, Davao

How to Get There:
Fly from Manila to Cotabato, then take a bus to Kidapawan.

What is it?
Standing at the tip of Mt. Apo would make you the tallest person in the Philippines, since it’s the country’s highest point. The hike to the summit will take you through dense forests, grand waterfalls and past some endangered plant and animal species.

Fun Fact:
Mt. Apo is actually a volcano that has never erupted.

""...Every country has unique things to offer, but the Philippines is, by far, my favorite. I've never met a kinder group of people and a more beautiful landscape. The blues of waters, the most exaggerated landscapes, there is just so much to do!

""My time in the Philippines was unforgettable and i loved it so much that i'll actually be going back in 2016.""

Check out his HONEST review of his visit to some of the Philippines' top destinations, including Bohol, Cebu, Palawan, and Siquijor, through this Vlog and we hope you too get to experience how MORE FUN it is in the Philippines!

P.S. Just some minor corrections and suggestions:

(1) On the duration of tourist visa:
a foreign traveller can actually stay in the Philippines visa-free for 30 days and not 21 days, as stated in the video.

(2) The whole of Mindanao is not unsafe and there are equally beautiful touristic destinations one could visit in there such as Siargao, which is becoming a world surf haven; Cagayan de Oro, known for the wild river rafting; Davao, where the Philippines' highest peak, Mt. Apo, could be trekked; Camiguin, where you could swim in a carbonated water, and many more! :-)

#VisitPhilippinesAGAIN2016If anyone is planning to go traveling to Southeast Asia, consider adding The Philippines to your list!

The Philippines was the highlight of my trip and I will definitely be back.

#ThePhilippines #ItsMoreFunInThePhilippines #Travel","I agree with Christian Leblanc and after visiting the Philipinnes for 6 weeks in September/ October 2014, I am actually moving there in 3 weeks ( the 1st week of February) I cannot wait to be among those wonderful people!$$I absolutely love the Philippines , this is a a great video , I have done a few of the things Christian had done , Cebu , Bohol , Dumagete , I am returning in Feb to do a little more , Kawasan falls,  and Palawan , can't wait !!$$My visit to Manila and QC...truly changed my life... The wonderful food and the kind generous people. Who showed me that I didn't need possessions to be happy. I help some street kids...and for the first time in my life.... I give of myself without expecting anything in return...but my joy was priceless 🙏🏼.  I came back to US... But I left my heart in the Philippines ....God bless the Philippines.... Pinoy pride....👍🏻👍🏻💯$$I love all about the Philippines, but most if all its people, will be going there for a few weeks soon <3$$I love that you have shared this video The Philippines... it was an awesome video and full of great info! I noticed that in your caption you have highlighted ""Corrections""... I think it would be great if you included in this that Mindanao as a whole isn't unsafe, and that many areas in Northern Mindanao can happily be explored and experienced as any other areas in the country.  

For example:

Camiguin is technically part of Mindanao... Cagayan de Oro where I live is part of Mindanao... Siargao (one of the biggest backpacking islands) is part of Mindanao. 

It would be great if you ""stuck up for Mindanao"" in your caption as well.  

Have a great day.$$Dean JB, Filipino hospitality is second to none, sometimes to a fault. We will kill our last pig to serve to our guests.

Tam-Awan Village, Baguio

What is it like? 
Baguio City is a city on the Cordillera Central mountain range, which is 1,600 meters above sea level. The place is lined with pine trees, and has a subtropical highland climate with temperatures going down as low as nine degrees Celcius during the cool months of December, January and February. ""The Summer Capital of the Philippines"" can get a little crowded during March, April and May, when people from other cities come for a visit to escape the urban heat. 

Fun Fact: 
Tam-Awan was built to showcase a model village of authentic Ifugao huts, which are expertly constructed without the use of nails. The compact huts are elevated to shoulder level by four sturdy wooden posts. Tam-Awan is a popular tourist site in Baguio City not only for its huts, but also for its art galleries, annual art exhibits, workshops and cultural performances.

Sorry, but  isnt that nazi's symbol? omg. really sorry ._.$$In eastern teachings swastika means eternity or higher being while during WW II Hitler's Arian movement meant what it the world has become to known it as much twisted & malevolent value to such a peaceful symbol!$$The swastika was the symbol of good fortune, prosperity, and longevity in many Far Eastern countries. The word swastika comes from the Sanskrit svasti, which means good fortune, luck, and well-being. In Buddhism, the swastika represents the turning of the “Dharma wheel”, and thereby promotes goodwill, compassion, and generosity to all sentient beings. Regrettably, Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party borrowed the swastika in the early 1900s, reversed it, and used it as their party emblem during World War II. Not only do the Nazi swastika and the ancient swastika used in Buddhism and Eastern cultures differ in meaning, the Nazi swastika is also slanted, resting on a point, and has right angles bent in a clockwise direction. The traditional swastika lays flat and is counterclockwise.$$The ""swastika"" symbol is seen all over the Buddhist temples!  It is actually a VERY ancient symbol with that has been used by Hinddis (? Sp) & Buddhists.  It has a more complex meaning than what I wrote.$$thanks for the info.

Every 9th of January, the life-sized figure of Christ is brought out of the Quiapo Church to the Quirino Grandstand and from there, it's carried through town back to the Church by barefooted devotees yelling ""Viva Señor"" while a huge crowd attempts to touch the statue.

An annual event that started back in 09 January 1787, the Traslacion, as it is commonly called, has become a sacred devotion for many Filipinos around the country, such that the entire procession could last for almost 24 hours.

The longest traslación was recorded in 2012 which lasted 22 hours. In recent years, the procession has captured the attention of the international media for being one of the largest religious gatherings in the world.

Photo by Reuters photographer Ezra Acayan ","We have been taught by the Roman Catholic Church that the images and icons used in the church are not actually “worshiped” but are simply “visual aids” to worship.
Catholics use statues to recall the person depicted. 
Just as YOU looking at your loved ones picture.
the link between us and God is Faith.
To those who talk and think negatively about the #BlackNazarene
ask yourself.
How are you sure of what you believe in?
Religion is a never ending argument.
I am no saint. Im a sinner. but one thing everyone should practice #RESPECT #respectbegetsrespect
VIVA SENYOR NAZARENO!$$It's not about da image,is about a faith on there heart.pic show how Filipinos having strong faith to God Jesus$$Yung sinasabe na imahen or idol ang sinasamba namen mga Katoliko. Tanong ko lang? Bakit tinayo ang bantayog ni Rizal sa Luneta? Simple answer: to commemorate his act of heroism and for what he did for this country. Bakit tayo may imahe ng Poong Itim na Nazareno? To commemorate the suffering of Christ before He was nailed on the cross. Yung imahe nya na nagsusuffer, parang nakakarelate ang mga ordinaryong Pilipino na naghihirap, na manalig lang sa Diyos at giginhawa ang buhay nila. Kahit hindi pa nila nakakamtaman yung maginhawang buhay mas lalo tumitindi ang pananampalataya nila sa Panginoon. Please respect our faith as we respect yours. The Fiest of the Black Nazarene is way of showing what faith can do to ordinary people like me and every devotee of the "" Itim na Nazareno "".$$Lord look not on their failure to serve you right,but forgive them & shows the right way to worship you in spirit & in truth$$Images and names of Jesus are all representations of many remarkable stages of HIS life. And so are the images and names of Mary and the saints. All created to remind us all of something important in line with the bible. Faith is what drives people to touch and kiss them. I am a Catholic, i used to when I was a kid. I realized, people who kiss and touch these images are driven by faith (either to ask for something and to express gratitude), which Priests and Bishops have no control of. I believe, we all have different means and ways of expressing our faith. No one can say which one is right or wrong. Only God can judge us all.

And i dont ask people to believe me or any of us. We and all the followers of the other religions are being judged, anyway. But keep in mind, we all have our own ways and rights practicing our faith. 

If one speaks on behalf of the bible then he she it they must exhibit that respect learnt from it.$$God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.  How can an idol or graven image create heaven and earth.  Graven image has ear but can not hear. Has eyes but can not see has lips but can not speak has feet but can not walk. True God is mighty, creator  of the universe , mountains bow down and the sea will roar at the sound of His name. Jesus Christ the second God of the Trinity.$$Rather than to judge the Nazarene devotees (and the Roman Catholic Church as a whole), it is better to know and understand the story and heart of each person. Know the facts, ask the devotees themselves, try to put yourselves in their shoes first.

His Eminence Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle shared wonderful insights regarding this. Please take time to read. God bless us all! 

http://www.cbcpnews.com/cbcpnews/?p=70617$$WILD and MISTAKEN ANALOGY.

I was surprised to see on my newsfeed two pictures. Picture of the golden calf being worshipped by the Israelites with a caption “NOON”. The other is a picture of the itim na Poong Nazareno being carried and held in procession by the devotees with a caption “NGAYON”.

While the one who posted it was giving a caution that the devotees of today or even the Catholic Church herself of committing the same mistake of worshipping an idol, it does try to make an analogy, i.e. they denote the same context. The innocent, ignorant, and uncritical viewer might make a quick conclusion and like, share, and make a comment of approval on it.

Regarding that post, I offer these nuances;

1. We, Catholics, had always been proclaiming that we do not worship images. When we use images, we satisfy our human need to see and to feel our God and saints by representing them. There is no way we will entrust our life and salvation to a piece of wood or any man made images.
2. While our actions maybe misinterpreted, what counts are what we stand for. The homily of His Eminence Cardinal Tagle in the fiesta mass early this morning responds partly to this. The dire need of the devotees make them commit some acts which maybe bordering or even tantamount to idolatry yet, deep inside, it is actually faith of a different approach but deep and meaningful anyway.
3. There is a lot of and great difference between the golden calf and the image of the Black Nazarene who is Jesus Christ Himself. The golden calf was a pagan representation while the Black Nazarene is our representation of Jesus, the Second Person of the Trinity, our Messiah. The devotion is drawn not by the image itself but the one being represented by the image. Can those devotees still worship without the image? The answer is that it maybe difficult but they still can. But why make it difficult when it can be made easier by those representation images?
4. The dynamics of the use of symbols and signs in worship come to mind. As human beings, we live with signs and symbols. We cannot live without them. The caution is to focus on the meaning of symbols and the messages of the signs. The bible is a symbol of the compilation of the Word of God. The letters and the words in the bible are signs (images) of the messages. Thus, those religions who claim that they do not use “images” are either telling a lie or are being deceived. To worship the bible as a book and not its content and messages is also bordering on idolatry. Remember, the Word of God came before the “bible” that we have now. Even without the “bible”, the Word of God still exists.

We were cautioned by that post. I throw the same caution in easily accepting or being misled by it.

Happy feast of the Black Nazarene!
(Just saying.)$$If you have the faith... No need to have pictures or images... A prayer alone is enough to remember the Christ the Saviour...$$This is your society on religion. 

If a hundred people were regularly injured at an annual rock concert, that annual rock concert would be investigated and shut down. But somehow we've come to accept and expect that a hundred people are injured consistently every year at a religious event. On many years, a number of people are even trampled to death. We would even be surprised if this year there were no deaths. Are you on drugs or something? I'm not.$$Black Nazarene is not worship as God. He is like an idol for others to follow the way he was been. An example of true believer of God.$$black nazarene help my whole family far from danger and mostly to have a good health especially me.This i ask in the name of our lord jesus christ amen.$$I will make this post for the information and the benefit of some Catholic. In Exodus 20, God made a covenant with Moses, explaining all the Ten Commandments. Now these stabbers rely on that from the Old Testament of the Prophets. These stabbers are like those meddling Hebrew teachers who scrutinized Jesus because of His teaching. They all ask questions trying to see the errors of His teaching but they failed. When Jesus started preaching, He enlighten this teachers including questions about marriage and the sabbath day. Now which teaching do you prefer, the Prophets or Jesus.? From Ten Commandments, Jesus made it two. So change was evident in the New Testament. Now why rely on the old scriptures? Jesus said ""I am the Light, the Way, the Truth and the Life, none can pass to the Father without passing through Me."" He also said, ""Though they have eyes, they will not see; though they have ears, they will not hear."" Now he is the blind and the deaf? May you be enlightened.$$Exodus 20:4-5. 4. Thou shalt not Make unto thee any graven Images, or  any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water. 5.  You shall not worship them or serve them, for I, the LORD your GOD. am a Jealous God,  visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me.$$Isaiah 44:9-12 all who makes idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame. Who shapes a god and cast an idol, which can profit nothing? People who do that will be put to shame; such craftsmen are only human beings. Let them all come together and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror amd shame. The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint.

Habakkuk 2:18 of what value is an idol carved by craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one  who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.

John 4:24 God is spirit, and his worshipper must worship in the Spirit and in truth.

Would rather obey God or your religion?

Acts 5:29
29    Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.

God invented and man invented religion.

Christianity is not a religion. Christians must choose between obeying religion or obeying God's law or commandments.$$I'm a catholic and I respect other people's beliefs. But saying that we need saints and mother mary as channel for our prayer to reach God, I guess we don't understand faith that much. God is all around us, with us, closer than we can imagine, 24/7. All we need is to simply talk to him directly thru a prayer. That's it. The problem with most of us Catholics is that WE RARELY READ THE BIBLE. We just believe what others tell us about religion and christianity. If we read the Bible, we'd think twice about going to religious processions such as this. When was the last time you read the bible? 😃$$One last post. Catholic does not worship or idolize the statues and images you thought they have worshiped. The image or the statue is a representation or the reflection of the life of Christ or any other Saints, their passion or sacrifice. Something a lot of you would not understand. If you do not believe in the image of Jesus it is a blank space, nothing really, only a void. We were not born when Jesus walked among man, so when you pray how would you imagine Him? In the presence of the image you can figure Jesus passion and sacrifice. It is like this, If you did not believe in the Crucifix, then you did not believe in the sacrifice of Jesus and salvation. Upon the cross, His sinless body laid, he died carrying the weight of all the sinners, to save us all. Upon the cross, our selves are deemed by His sacrifice, a sacrifice for our Salvation. Our faith binds us directly to Him, and by the image/statue/crucifix or cross, we can clearly see Jesus, strengthening our prayer because as we close our eyes, we can see Him and feel His presence. I hope that was clear. The Black Nazarene is a representation of Jesus' passion, imagine Jesus in flesh walking, carrying His cross with all those people reaching out for him.$$Be Safe there!! Hope it'll be Peaceful and successful celebration. May the peace and glory shall cover the world :) #BlackNazarene$$""No one including religious sectors is PERFECT!"" This is a free country same as the Philippines. Everyone has the right to choose what type of belief practices they chose to follow. Bless those who believe in the goodness and power of the Lord, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit!🙏👏$$Most of these stabbers focus on one text only from the Exodus, from the Old Testament, now Jesus came and His disciples compiled His teaching, on the New Covenant. Now how about this, we do ours do your. Have a little respect, respect our way because we didn't critcize your ways. Now if you don't respect us then do you think you have for yourself? Love the people around you and you'll recieve too. God's way is too complex none of us can reach, so for what He had installed for us, we'll never know. So live your own way. He knows everything, we don't. For whatever we do, judgement is always fair in the arms of the Saviour.$$Really incredible!!!
That's how Filipinos and many foreigners too fanatically join in venerating and processing this Black Nazarene .$$Please respect their faith,if you're not believing in image (statue) or if you are non catholic .You should give respect to catholic faith. Catholic believers not asking anybody to believe in statue or give you rosary or to invite you in the holy mass. So let the people pray and believe in any religion. #RESPECT #RESPECT #RESPECT$$For all of you who had bashed the Catholics. Here's something you might want to read to give you view of what we do. How our prayers are carried by Saints. Heres an example from the Virgin Mary. Here everything is explained and don't tell me Google texts are lies, well not all. And if you have more doubts, ask Vatican. http://www.theholyrosary.org/fatimaapparitions$$I was born and raised in Angeles city , Philippines till I left for Canada in 1974. We have a small church close to our house and there is the chapel call visitang Apu, there is our Black Nazareno lying there since the world war 2. People all over come and visit specially Fridays. As far as I can recall ,other Catholic Churches attempted to move the Black Nazareno but unable to. Now this church became a Shrine. All the remarks I have read so far make sense. Spirituality is a choice. Believe in faith or not.$$We respect your traditions and beliefs that's why for years, we are not complaining about it but when we gather in edsa to fight for our faith, most of you branded us as nuisance.may you have a peaceful and ZERO casualty celebration.

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University’s Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Best Regards
Yours Cordially

Palawan

What is it?
Club Paradise Resort is surrounded by a house reef which is easily accessible to divers and has a diverse marine system. Near this reef is the feeding ground of sea turtles and dugongs (sea cows) – the gentle giants of the sea. There are tours that take you along the coast of Busuanga for some dugong-watching.

How to get there? 
Fly into Puerto Princesa from Busuanga, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo or Manila. 

Fun Fact: 
Some believe that stories of mermaids came about when lonely sailors spotted dugongs swimming in the ocean, and mistook their shape as that of half-woman, half-fish creatures.

이번 기회에 서울타워 색깔의 의미를 꼭 알아두세요.

*빨간색: 미세먼지, 초미세먼지 경보가 발령된 경우
*파란색: 초미세먼지 농도가 20㎍/m³이하일 경우 
*초록색: 초미세먼지 농도가 20㎍/m³초과하고 미세먼지·초미세먼지 경보가 없는 경우  

*참고로, 현재 N서울타워는 빨간색, 파란색, 초록색 세 가지 색깔 조명만 켠답니다. 예전에 켰던 보라색과 노란색, 흰색 조명은 더 이상 사용하지 않는다고 해요.

Upon arriving in El Nido, we raced to the town's shore to catch sundown. The tide was slowly rolling in, as boats began to arrive from a day's adventure at sea. Golds began to color the sky, and gleam directly onto the town, full of life. Suddenly these two dogs came sprinting down the beach, and began roughhousing directly in front of us. It wasn't long until they lost steam and plopped on the sand next to us, as we watched the sun drop, bleeding its colors to the final day's pastels on the water's reflection.

Tarsiers of course and spectacular fireflies but I also saw sunbirds and a Philippine hawk owl where this photo was taken on the hotel veranda <3$$Para Sa Mga Nagdadalawang Isip Para Iboto Si Mayor Duterte please read this:

The attacks against Mayor Duterte is so intense. I've never seen such attacks against a frontrunner in the past 2 National Elections. With just few days left, these will even intensify. If you are a supporter and thinking of withdrawing your vote for Duterte because of his issues, brace yourselves and remember the reason why you supported Duterte in the first place. We've started from the bottom, now we're here. Change is coming. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future. This man has a huge sincere heart that I believe will benefit the country.

Maraming nagsasabi na ""if you want change, start in yourself at wag iasa sa magiging pangulo."" I agree, pero wag nating kaligtaan na marami ding mga tao na kahit kaya nilang simulan yung pagbabago sa sarili nila, kailangan padin nila ng isang tagapanguna na kaya silang tulungan na mangyari yung pagbabago na hindi lang sa sarili nila kundi sa kabuuan ng isang bansa. I believe that Duterte is the man.

Everytime he talks about his country and the change that he wants to bring, he is very sincere. Para siyang stand-up comedian bago magstart yung 2nd debate sa TV-5 (joking about Mar going to restroom and not knowing a single person from the audience), nakakatawa. He is known for his gutter language at offensive siya minsan. Sabi nga ng iba parang di siya nagiisip bago magsalita. But everytime he speaks about his love for the country and concern for his fellow Filipinos, he is very sincere. He has the most heartfelt messages. Sincerity makes the very least person to be of more value than the most talented ones.

He is also the candidate na hindi uhaw na uhaw na maging presidente. I believe it’s because his heart is really for the people and not for the position. He said many times that he will not die if he does not become a president. He said he will not apologize for who he is even if he lose the presidency.

While the other candidates in the last debate promoted themselves as the rightful president and expressed their confidence in winning the election, he simply said, “Wala akong hangarin except for my country. And I pray to God that the nation will be enlightened with His Grace, and you can choose the leader, bahala na kayo kung sino, the one who can make it happen.” Did you see that? Tayo na daw bahala. Di niya tayo pinipilit o pinapakiusapan na siya ang iboto. Also notice, his desire is for the country and his prayer is not for the people to be enlightened by his track record, leadership and platform (though those were really good), but be enlightened by God’s grace. He did not rely on himself and his achievements, he entrusted everything in the Grace of God.

I don’t want to sound like a priest but I hope that the religious leaders noticed it too. Only Duterte and Miriam mentioned in their closing speech that they are praying to God for the welfare of this nation. You see? Si Mayor Duterte, palamura, womanizer daw, corrupt daw, murderer daw, in other words makasalanan. But he is seeking God’s grace in this endeavour.

I’d rather support this “sinner” who depends on the grace of God than those religious leaders and self-righteous politicians who depend on themselves. I’d rather vote for someone na hindi “disente"" at hindi atat na manalo kaysa dun sa sumisigaw na siya ang mananalo. I will choose Duterte for his sincerity and desire to make sure that his fellowmen are safe and free from criminality, drugs, and corruption.

Sabi ng karamihan magdesisyon daw ayon sa character, moralidad, at kakayahan ng isang kandidato. Nope, ang desisyon ko ay base sa sinseridad at pagdepende ng kandidato sa biyaya ng Diyos. Because God’s grace can transform someone’s character and morality into better. But it cannot change a self-righteous person simply because they won’t even see the need for that Grace because they just depend on their own goodness.

Now, what if one day I realized that I supported the wrong person? Then be it. Life goes on. We just learn from it. In fact, we have been making bad decisions in electing Senators, VP and President in the past. Who knows this time, we’re making a good one. They say that a vote for Duterte is a high risk. Well, I'm taking the risk because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. I don’t really think that this 71 year old man would like to be remembered as a bad leader. I believe that he wants to leave a legacy that will change the course of this country.

It is apparent that there is a very strong opposition to stop the Davao City Mayor. But the greater the opposition, the greater the opportunity. An opportunity to stop the dominion of the elites and oligarchs. An opportunity to fight, suppress and stop drugs, crime and corruption. An opportunity to clean the government and the system. Change is coming. Lets DU it! Duterte for President!$$Yesterday's river cruise at Loboc, Bohol. 😍🇵🇭 EarLa Navarro$$Well known with its powdery white sandbar and crystal clear water.

4703,67558139928_10153554682914929,"Batik is a technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to whole cloth, or cloth made using this technique. The word of batik is derived from the word “ambatik” which means “a cloth with little dots”. The suffix “tik” means “little dot, drop, point or to make dots”. Batik may also originate from the Javanese word “tritik” which describes a resist process for dying where the patterns are reserved on the textiles by tying and sewing areas prior to dying, similar to tie dye techniques. Another Javanese phase for the mystical experience of making batik is “mbatik manah” which means ”drawing a batik design on the earth”.

Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting or by printing resist with a copper stamp called a cap. The applied wax itself resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to color selectively by soaking the cloth in the one color, removing the wax with boiling water and repeating the process if multiple colors are desired.

Batik which made in the island of Java has a long history of acculturation, with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures, and is the most developed in terms of pattern, technique and the quality of workmanship. On October 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian Batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. http://ow.ly/RydRE

Yama-dera (“Mountain-Temple”) is a place where offers you the scenic beauty!
The place is famous for the “Haiku” written by Matsuo Basho, the famous Japanese poet in the 17th century. He read,
“Ah, this silence / Sinking into the Rocks / Voice of Cicada”
After climbing up the narrow and steep stone steps for a while, you will find the view he saw. Local specialty called Tama Konnyaku (a gelatinous food made from devil’s-tongue starch) is sold on the way to your journey to the top. Bite some, it’ll encourage your steps!

[Direction] From Tokyo: 2h30min to Yamagata Station by JR Yamagata Shinkansen, then 20min by JR Senzan-Line to Yamadera Station

My name is MARVIS MARCEL from KENYA and I'm happily married to a lovely and caring

husband,with two kids.A very big problem occurred in my family seven months ago,between me and my husband.so terrible that he took the

case to court for a

divorce.he said that he never wanted to stay with me again,and that he didn't love me anymore.So he packed out of my house

and made me and

my children passed through several pain. I tried all my possible means to get her back,after much begging,but all to no avail.and he

confirmed it that he has made her decision,and he never wanted to see me again.

So on one evening,as i was coming back from work,i met an old friend of mine who asked of my husband.So i explained every thing to

her,so he told me that the only way i can get my husband back,is to visit a spell caster,because it has really worked for her too.So i never

believed in spell,but i had no other choice,than to follow her advice. Then he gave me the email address of the spell caster whom

he visited spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com So the next morning,i sent a mail to the address he gave to me,and the spell caster

assured me that i will get my husband back the next day.What an amazing statement!! I never believed,so he spoke with me,and told me

everything that i need to do. Then the next morning, So surprisingly, my husband who didn't call me for the past seven {7}months, gave

me a call to inform me that he was coming back.So Amazing!! So that was how he came back that same day,with lots of love and

joy,and he apologized for her mistake,and for the pain he caused me and my children. Then from that day,our relationship was now

stronger than how it were before,by the help of a spell caster.

So, i will advice you out there to kindly contact him through his email spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com if you are in any condition

like this,or you have any problem related to ""bringing your ex Husband or husband, Girfriend back.

So thanks to DR Sambo for bringing back my husband,and brought great joy to my family once again. spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com

Please PM us your Full Name, IC number, and HP number, and we'll get back you on how to collect your prize.$$1) I will always take away my uneaten food at a restaurant, no matter how fancy. Great for lunch the next day!
2) bring my own Tupperware if I know I'm gg to buy food back for lunch in office etc 
3) reduce use of plastic bags by not asking for/returning plastic bags at places like bubble tea shops. Also bring my own bag when I go marketing. Drives the stall holders crazy but I have significantly reduced my plastic bag consumption 
4) use newspaper to pick up dogs poo instead of plastic bags. 100% biodegradable!
5) recycle every paper made carton or plastic container that comes through my house$$1. Don't use paper tissues. A cloth handkerchief is evergreen and very useful.
2. Invest in a cloth Tote bag and carry it to the supermarket. Say no to plastic bags.
3. Recycle properly and segregate your waste properly.
4. Don't waste water and instruct your house help to turn off taps when not using. Install low capacity showers n cisterns at home. Don't overwater plants in your garden and use water left from washing Vegetables to water plants.
5. Don't print unnecessary documents. Use e- tickets, e- receipts etc. Ask your bank to send you email statements. Same for utility bills, mobile bills etc. 
6. Donate old clothes, books, bags etc. 
7. Don't waste food. Leftover veggies and meat can be used as stuffing for sandwiches or rolls. Cook/order only how much you can eat.
8. Try and use reusable utensils, bottles etc.
9. Carry a plastic bag in your handbag always. Use it to carry stuff during emergencies or impulse shopping or your umbrella. Dry it and use it again. I see people wasting a lot of plastic bags for their umbrellas at work or in malls.
 That's all from me folks 😊$$Firstly, watch this video to feel inspired: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDQcBQUDpw It has to begin with a lifestyle change. Fret not, baby steps!                                           1) Just like the Meghan Trainer song, say ""NO"" to things like straws in your drink, plastic or paper bags at stores, and receipts                                                                  2) Make a grocery list when you go shopping to avoid buying impulse items                                                                                               3) Attempt buying 2nd hand clothes/bags instead of new ones (one man's trash is another man's treasure!                                            4) Buy detergent and dish soap in boxes instead of plastic bottles. Cardboard can be more easily recycled and made into more products than plastic                                                                                   5) Whenever possible, bring your own reusable container to dabao food or bring home your restaurant leftovers                                      6)Instead of buying juice in plastic bottles, make your own fresh-squeezed juice or simply eat fresh fruit. Not only does this cut down on plastic waste, but it's also better for you because you'll be getting more vitamins and antioxidants and less high fructose corn syrup:)       John Oliver said it best in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xwLWb0lLY, 1 earth, we got to do our part for it;)$$[W]ELL, you've got to challenge yourself to reduce food wastage today with the tips below! :)

[A]VOID cluttering the fridge, freezer and pantry. Pack things neatly and visibly, always move older products to the front so you consume them first.

[S]PLIT or SHARE the giant portion dish if eating out with friends so you don’t waste the large sized portions usually served in restaurants.

[T]HINK before shopping and cooking. Try shopping with a list with necessary food items on it and shop with meals in mind. Cook while thinking of making use of leftover food ensuring you eat everything you buy.

[E]XPIRATION dates suggest how long the product is likely to remain at its best quality when unopened, but it's not a safety date. Hence most foods like unopened item properly stored stay fresh past the “use-by” date. Don't throw these food immediately after the expiration date is due.$$I try to reduce wastage doing the following:
1) buy condiments in the smallest size possible, so there is a higher chance of using them up before expiry.  same with produce.  anyway, fresher is better
2) I try not to cook more than the amount that my family can consume. well, if they are not full after eating, just eat more fruits later on!
3) i freeze ripe fruits like grapes, strawberries, blueberries and bananas if i see that my family won't be finishing them any time soon
4) i use my own shopping bag instead of plastic bags.$$1. I always bring my own tupperware when I go out to eat! Used my own container for places like acai project (below!), cocowhip etc:)
2. I minimise the amount of packaging I consume by using my own bags when I go grocery shopping and by supporting eco products like a biodegradable toothbrush so that whatever I throw away can return to the earth! I also use handkerchiefs instead of tissue paper because every little bit counts, no?$$I didn't have frozen spring onion pancakes so I fried a roti prata in spring onion oil. 
I didn't have spicy bean paste so I used hoisin and chilli oil. 

Tadah: Easy Jian Bing 

1. Make it a point to just use whatever u have at home.
2. Scour the web for easy recipes that look good to u. 
3.Experiment with flavours.

Credit to thewoksoflife for inspiration$$When life gives you left overs from last night, make an aglio olio with everything on it :-) I also make omelets with left over potatoes and meat. Other than this, we segregate our trash at home and put them at the disposal bins below our apartment for recycling.  The food waste and other biodegradable items are put in a bin and are being used by the gardeners for the plants. Nothing is wasted in our apartment :-)$$Buy only what you will eat within the week so you dont waste food which expire or spoil easily.

Also, try to make takeaway boxes to lunch from overnight food. Eg, making fried rice from leftover rice and adding some ingredients.

Share your food if the portion is too big so there is no wastage! You can even use parts of food like the skin of fruits as fertilizer to your plants! <3$$1) I use the fibres leftover from juicing fruit juice as plant fertilisers n DIY face mask
2) Bring along a container to my canteen when buying food. It's also role modelling to the kids in my school.
3) Use leftover food and recreate another new dish the next day. For example I used leftover fried rice to make cheese baked rice!
4) Basically my rule of thumb is to try reusing everything more than once when possible. 

Maximise usage to minimise waste!$$1. When you have fresh vegetables in your fridge and you know you'll be eating out for the next few days (as Singaporeans do!) blanch them and store in a ziplock in the freezer for future use! Saves the veg from going bad, and saves cooking time for the next time you need to whip up a quick meal!

2. Use all vegetable scraps (carrot skins, celery bases, onion tops/bases, etc) to make your own homemade vegetable stock instead of throwing them away

3. Bring your own Tupperware when tabaoing food outside. It saves the use of plastic/styrofoam disposable boxes, and if you can't finish your food, you already have it stored in a Tupperware which you can keep in your fridge to finish up or repurpose into another meal later!$$Be Minimalist by 
1. Cultivate our mind & emotions.
2. Focus on the essentials - consume less but enjoy more.
3. Appreciate the art of making something. Eg: Hardwork of farming/cooking or sewing clothes/shoes.
4. Strive for better yet not marginalize others.$$Reduce food waste by:
1) buy only required quantity 
2) cook only portions that can be consumed
3) can't finish, put food in Tupperware and store in the fridge for following day's consumption 
4) share big quantity food  neighbors and friends 
5) avoid being too greedy when dine out and order too many food 
6) don't be kiasu and can't finish food taken during buffet time 
7) bear in mind many children are starving at less developed countries 
8) generous in food donations to needy families$$1. Cook only the amount you and your family are able to eat, the remain ingredient could keep to use tmr. If there any part which not able to eat such as veg head/root. Feed to pet living in the house. If no pet, cut into smaller pieces and buried into your plant soil.

2. Left over food can either feed to dog or keep in a container into the fridge. 

3. If eat outside, ask for less rice or request small plate and share with other. 

4. If no appetite to eat anything, and u hungry, have a meal replacement instead, such as protein shake or cereal.$$My family is a coffee drinker and we brew fresh coffee every morning, instead of wasting the brewed coffee ground, we use it as plant fertilizer and DIY anti cellulite body scrub! And instead of throwing unused vegetables away, we use it to re-grow new plants and harvest new vegetables for the family to eat home grown organic vegetables. And instead of throwing peeled fruit skin, we use it to clean dishes (leftover lemon skin), Polish shoes (leftover banana skin), we also use orange skin as DIY room freshener (no chemical) and so many more! Here are my tips to live green to reduce waste ❤️$$1. Order about 5-10% less than what you think you will need 
2. Allocate leftovers for the next meal
3. Drink more water / eat more fibre related foods to fill more full easily$$We bought a steamboat stove with grill plate. Cook on spot what you want to eat, remaining can cook other dishes or make sandwich/salad/wrap for next day! 😉$$Buy in moderation and clear everything in the fridge before buying more... Keep lookout for clearance sales in Marts and have a budget in mind before shopping...$$Thanks TheSmartLocal.com for the generous giveaway! Some of my tips are:

1) Reuse/ recycle - e.g. used yakult bottles can be washed and be used as stationeries holders
2) Be kiasu - bring your own container/reusable bags when buying things
3) Go electronically - avoid/minimize printing of papers
4) Donate useful items to charitable organisations 
5) Compost food waste (my company is currently doing it!)
6) Pass on the list to others!

Hope to be one of the lucky winners! ^^$$Before the currency was invented, people trade. They trade livestocks, food for services, clothes for food, among others. And this is one of the ways we can reduce our waste. Instead of buying new clothes, we can trade our old clothes with our friends for some new or fresh styles. How about trading your old crib for some new toys for your kids? You can buy plenty of secondhand clothes and items online. They are cheaper and you are actually recycling too :-) We minimise the use of resources this way. Great way to go green!$$We minimize waste in our home by:

1) Segregating our trash and putting them in the recycling bins.

2) Up-cycling glass bottles and plastic containers. We turned the old ice cream container into an art organizer for my kid and the oatmeal container into a toy jar. It's good to teach them young about the value of recycling. 

And of course, the glass bottle is turned into a vase and spice jars. I but my spices in bulk and use the old glass jars to store them in. 

3) Use cotton re-usable diapers instead of the disposable ones. I save a lot of money and I save the environment too because I reduce the amount of plastic being thrown out. Also, instead of using serviettes or kitchen papers, use a washable dish towel for wiping surfaces. 

4) To reduce energy wastage, we open the windows to let the sunshine and the air in so we don't have to turn on the lights or use the airconditioning all the time.

Every little bit helps. Joy Sung join :-)$$1) Shop smart during grocery shopping. We go to the supermarket three times a week, once during the weekends and twice during weekday nights and buy groceries for our cooking. This way, we will not ""overstock"".

2. When eating out, i will order for the family with two young girls but not myself. This way, I can finish up the leftover food. 

3. In the event of leftovers after a cooked meal, we will store them in the fridge, reheat the next day and packed them for lunch in the office

4. We store our food in correct places. Fruits which does not require refrigeration must be stored in a cool dry place to maximise their life span. 

5. Adopt FIFO concept when storing food in the fridge. Always consume the food you put in the fridge first. 

6. Buy pre loved toys for the children and hand them down to orher children. 

7. Bring your old bags when doing shopping$$If only there's some form of platform or app for people to share certain items and can buy together eg: I probably only need 100ml out of 300ml of soya sauce as I don't cook often, or 2kg out of 10kg rice etc, yet paying lesser. This will keep wastage to the minimum since you only buy what you need. By recycling the bottles or packaging you had used before, helps to keep wastage to the lowest too.$$After we have gotten our new home, we have to shop and manage our things wisely as all the things bought means $$ going out.
Towards a Zero Waste Challenge:
1) Research for recipes that we want to whip up and buy what we need instead of buying the ingredients first and think of what dishes to cook.
2) If we have unused food in fridge, we'll research for dishes that require them! 
E.g. We bought a packet of 5 salmon fillets, we've tried baking it and pan frying it! We'll always have packets of potatoes and carrots in our fridge as it's always easy to make a meal with roasted veggies! Whenever we bake fish/chicken, we can always pair it with roasted veggies. This helps us to ensure we eat healthily and we do not have too much unused food in the fridge!
3) If we bake a cake or make any desserts, we'll share them with our parents or friends so that they don't go bad in the fridge and our family and friends will also give us feedback to improve our desserts!
4) I'll always use the envelopes for my bills as rough paper. I do not have to search for foolscap or notepad!

was
a baby
girl named Marry. Her mother couldn't
take
all the
crying, so she decided it was time for her
to
go. She
buried her baby alive in her back yard.
After she
buried her she could still hear Marry
crying.
So she dug her back up and stabbed her
one
time in the arm,
and buried her again. Marry cried harder,
but a few
hours later it stopped. At exactly 12:42,
Marry died.
She bleed to death. Now her sprite
haunts
the
world. When your sleeping, she stabs
you in
the
arm and watches you bleed to death.
And
that's how she got the name ""Bloody
Marry"" this is the true story
of her. She wants everyone to feel her
pain
that she
felt. Apparently, if you re-post This isn't
fake.
Apparently, if you copy and paste this to
ten
comments in the next ten minuets you
will
have the
best day of your life tomorrow. You will
either get kissed or asked out, if you
brake
this chain you will
see a little dead girl in your room tonight.
In the next
53 minuets someone will say I love you
or
I'm sorry
to 12 other comments you will have the
best day of
your life tomorrow. But if you break this
chain you die
at exactly 12:42 tonight by Bloody Marry.

This is dedicated to all our Muslim friends out there who now have to bear the world's hatred. It should be directed at Terrorists, not Muslims. But sadly, people are going to generalise.

It is unfair that a tiny group with a distorted view of religion could cause so much distress to both Muslims and Non-Muslims. ","Please be aware that The Islamic State aka ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq & Syria) does not & will not represent all Muslim & Islam as a religion.

No religion preach violence or to harm others nor themselves. Terrorism is not an religion but an act of immorality against humanity & everything good that comes out from Peace.

We all must be educated to know this difference & not be misled.

News & media are using 'Islamic State' because that's what the terrorist group called themselves. Technically it isn't wrong but many whom are not aware might be mislead into relating Islam as a religion supporting such act of evil. It is ISIS agenda to create more hatred & making believe that all Muslims are apart of them. Creating a greater social diversity & unrest among people, nations & religions.

We as an individual can help to spread the understanding. A small action against terrorism, help to keep humanity & harmony in place. We are all a part of something bigger. Fight terrorism!

The TSL team went down for a first look. Here's what to expect! Orchid Garden is the world's first 24 hour Hello Kitty cafe. And it looks nothing like what you'll find in an airport.

Grand Opening Date: 12th May 2016
Address: Changi Airport Terminal 3 #01-22

Follow TheSmartLocal.com for more videos like this!

Verdict:
While the food is nothing to rave about, it’s passable considering people generally visit character cafes for the ambience and aesthetic, rather than to indulge in a gastronomic experience. We fell in love with the beautiful decor and how its open 24 hours a day. Imagine bringing your partner here for a surprise midnight tea date! 

Hello Kitty Orchid Garden succeeds in creating a unique experience for all Hello Kitty fans, both local or overseas.

Offers its programs to weaken and the gradual elimination of surface and underground earthquakes and rehabilitation of the water balance of the Philippines. 
The same or similar activities will be held in all the ASEAN countries, which will lead to improvement of the environmental and economic situation in the ASEAN countries and the Commonwealth of GDP growth.
First.
Quote: ""In the Philippines, for the year on average, there is more than 35 earthquakes (on average by 3 earthquakes per month) magnitude of 5.0 - 5.9, one earthquake of magnitude 6.0 - 6.9 or 7.0 - 7.9, then this country can be considered one of the most seismically active areas in the world. ""
Philippines - a country of many mountain formations. Mountain formation, adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates of thousands of years are in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. Take two bricks to hold them together metal strip, and will be heated. According to the law: solid body expands when heated, bricks expand and collapse. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists "". The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate slipped under another"" And such, and the smaller joints in the Philippines and around it - tens and hundreds.
Treatment. Cooling Philippine land and water in the surrounding seas. Terms reduce the amount of power and ground and underground earthquake and tsunami 7 years - 15% per year.
The second - the restoration of the water balance.
Within three months, it will be organized the production of crystal clear drinking water, and enriched with all kinds of trace elements, including iodine,
Drinking water in the first year will go to hospitals, schools, preschool centers of large cities and tourist centers, and then as the water production growth will fully satisfy the needs of the entire state.
Irrigation water will ensure the restoration of rivers and ground and underground reservoirs in the level and purity. This will increase the productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, increase in agricultural and meat dairy products), and the cultivation of new forests arrays. You will be met and many other works.
Conclusion.
Such proposals Philippines will not get from anyone, and all the disasters will increase and the number and power, and destroy the economy.
Visas in the Philippines nor I, nor the managers are not needed. Better to call me as a specialist for three months. During that time I, or one of the managers of our bearings, and someone left who - no, but a visa is not the main thing.

Clark, Pampanga

What is it? 
It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

How to get there: 
Fly into Clark from Incheon, Singapore, or Hong Kong.

Or take a bus from Pasay or Cubao.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

What is it?
The Filipino word for hello is ""have you eaten?"" That gives you an idea of how important food is to the people of the Philippines. Fruits, vegetables, root crops and rice are staples of the Filipino diet. And with water crisscrossing every part of the Philippines, so is fish. A traditional way of preserving them is letting them dry out under the sun. This can give them a shelf life of at least one year.

Fun Fact:
Filipinos love pairing something sweet with something salty. An example of this is eating tuyo (salty, dried fish) with champorado (porridge with cocoa) for breakfast — a strange but surprisingly delicious combination!

For many years, the kings of Spain have been fetching him to fashion out feasts for the Spanish royalty.

As early as in the time of the Spanish rule in the Philippines, Gene Gonzales' forehears have won awards in Spain.

His book ""Cocina Sulipeña"" that contained ancestral recipes from Sulipan in Apalit, Pampanga is the favorite of the king of Spain.

Wikipedia has an extensive writeup on Gene Gonzales
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Gonzalez$$Unknown to many Filipinos, the king of Spain in the 17th century was able to savour the cooking of an ancestor of Gene Gonzales so he asked the Governor-General of Spain to the Philippines why he has not been informed, but the official felt that he was reprimanded, and in his shame, he burned to the ground the whole of Sulipan in Apalit, Pampanga.

Gene Gonzales went back to his roots and came up with this book in 2009.

In 2010, the king of Spain apologized for the burning of Sulipan.

Philippines has so much to offer but are beaten by the likes of Thailand because they have infrastructure, order, unity in their goal to promote their country as a place for tourists. The Philippines should strive to lay it out well to make it a place to remember. Word of mouth from best experience is the best way to sell it. Davao and Mindanao have the best beaches in Asia but yet even a Filipino will not go there because its not safe for foreigners. There are no economical means to travel safely around Manila because of fear of being mugged. Place our people and give them the right incentive to support the goal not corrupt them!$$You both mentioned the important aspects to improve tourism.  I just want to add that the streets of Manila needed to be cleaned up.  It's crucial to provide the very best impression.  No one wants to get off the plane and be suffocated by fumes and greeted by sea of trash!

Korean version can be found here → http://bit.ly/1kGEYjF ","That's a bummer for multicultural couples. :( I'd like to go with my husband (I'm American; he's Korean).

What if Koreans and foreigners want to travel here together?$$KTO, thank you for your work and all the information provided which makes it very easy to travel around.
As some people have said above the fact that there are some tours for ""only foreigners"" is not understood by many because many people would like to go with their Korean friends or significant other. I guess it is just made to give opportunities for tourists who come from abroad, but still I find it unfair that Koreans cannot attend the tours in Chinese, English or Japanese if they wish to while a foreigner who has lived in Korea for 20 years could go. So, maybe it would be better to say ""only for non-residents""? There could be also the case of foreigners with Korean nationality.... what should they do? For all these reasons I would rather prefer to see ""Tours in Chinese, English and Japanese language"" better than ""foreigners"" being the case that KTO is mainly targeted to potential visitors to Korea which makes some 6.9 billion foreigners around the world and leave the word ""foreigner"" a bit meaningless. Also not all foreigners speak those languages, so my parents, for example, speak only Spanish and if they come to Korea they don't mind joining any of the 4 tours be it in Korean or English because they don't understand anything :)
I find it very useful and hospitable that you offer services in foreign languages, but from my point of view having queues to buy tickets only for foreigners (as in Yongin Folk Village) or entrance for foreigners (in Busan fireworks festival) is a little bit bizarre and kind of unfair for Koreans... I haven't seen anything similar in any other country. It's good that you make an effort but let tourists just live the experience as comfortably or uncomfortably as Koreans~

You have the chance to marvel at 11 species of sharks, over 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 12 kinds of whales and dolphins, and get this — 10,000 hectares of reefs.

Fun Fact: 
Aside from being a marine sanctuary, Tubbataha is also renowned for being a bird sanctuary. A lighthouse islet, at the southern tip of the South Atoll, supports a large number of seabirds which nest there.

We asked a former SIA girl, who told us how staff are ranked according to how many MCs they take.

https://mustsharenews.com/sia-mc-appraisals/","You never feel like the company looks out for you, not just in terms of MCs, but even in things like just basic protection of their staff. Remember the case where the SIA stewardess got slapped while on a flight by an upset wife? I remember the words of the SIA spokesperson; ""this is a personal matter, not a company matter"". She wouldn't even be on the damn plane if she wasn't WORKING FOR YOUR COMPANY, CAN?! How DARE you claim it's not a company matter when she's wearing the very uniform that made your company famous, working on one of your planes, talking to one of your passengers? I left after two years because there's no point destroying your body working for a company that will call you for a flight on midnight of the day your MC expires. Because sure, my illness will magically expire the second the clock strikes midnight, like I'm some kind of miracle healing Cinderella.$$Seriously I could never understand why people always chose to remain silent and are only willing to make noise and speak up when a human life is lost.

I find that most people can't work smart. We are born with choices. Its sad that people now value more about the stacks of cash in their bank accounts then their health. A life is so much more valuable.$$Aiyoooo pleassseeee~~ Do u all know that air crew gets 21 days Annual Leave and on the average about 100 off days a year. 

SIA rewards crew with a medical benefit of $300/year( or is it $200, I can't remember) for those who take extra care of their health and not fall sick. 

No one is forcing anyone to go on flight Sick. BUT there are really a lot of ""chao Geng"" crew out there who always conveniently falls sick on occasions like New Year eve, Christmas and especially when they are rostered for shitty low paying flights such as Sydney, Bombay for e.g. 

An employee can be damn good at her job, but if she lacks discipline and responsibility. Who can you blame. 

So the rest of those who works hard and make an effort to stay healthy to stay to their rosters are idiots is it? 

I am an ex crew who had taken numerous MCs, prolly falling into the mid ""chao geng"" category and I still qualified for promotion interview. 

P.S : I'm speaking up on behalf of the other flying crew who can't say no sh*t because the other crew members would aim them for speaking their mind. So yah, dun like what I say. Too bad.$$This is sooooo true and sooooo inhumane of a company to treat their employees. Also it has become a competition to see who score the highest based on MC rate. So unfair! How can your crew be happy working if the company doesn't care for their employees welfare!$$It's not just the flight crews I heard. Ground staff, in other subsidiaries like engineering also from what I heard from friends who work there. Apparently , in engineering , my Friend said if you took more than 7 days MC, you won't be eligible for the free staff air travel benefit for certain period of time. Not sure if really true but it's really sad if it is. That's why many afraid to take mc even if genuinely sick. Dunno why MOM so bo chap. How can staff benefit also be tied to how many mc u take. Not ethical at all.$$Boycott Sia! All passengers can get sick too due to the sick flight attendants whom FORCED to work.. the virus will spread faster in enclosed cabins ...$$Dun blame anyone!  Everything happened must has reason. 
Is she playful and dun take rest when itl's time to take a nap or rest? 
We must know "" How n When to discipline! ""$$It ain't just the flight crew, ya know?! Just sayin'...$$hmmm... what about the cabin crew members who take mc to avoid certain desirable flight routes?$$Not only SIA lah. This practise is like normal in SG companies. Why make it sound that only SIA is doing it. 😬$$My friend who was a SQ stewardess quit for mostly that same reason, and she vouch this practice was widely enforced within SQ$$I used to work in a few local companies..they use staffs number of MC taken, to evaluate their appraisals. I kena b4...sucks!$$Not just SIA... Alot of company practice this.$$Not the only company taking mc into account for appraisal.$$Beelin Khor please just take mc when you're sick.$$And their union accepted this practice?$$Lirong Lim Josephine Tan Shuzhen Sim Shuyu Tan Roselyn Tan the COMPANY POLICY sounds very familiar.... lolx",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Obando, Bulacan 

What is it like? 
Want a baby? Every year, single men and women and childless couples dance in the streets to seek help from the patron saints of matchmaking and fertility: Sta. Clara, San Pascual de Baylon and the Virgin of Salambao. 

Fun Fact: 
Local fishermen and farmers join in the dancing as well but instead of praying for children, they ask for a good harvest! With all the dancing involved, it's almost impossible not to join in yourself, whatever your intentions may be!

What is it? 
Tubbataha Reef is the mecca of Philippine diving, and a superstar in the international diving scene. It's accessible only by live-aboard dive boats between the months of March and June. You have the chance to marvel at 11 species of sharks, over 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 12 kinds of whales and dolphins, and get this — 10,000 hectares of reefs.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

Fun Fact:
Aside from being a marine sanctuary, Tubbataha is also renowned for being a bird sanctuary. A lighthouse islet, at the southern tip of the South Atoll, supports a large number of seabirds which nest there.

Bantayan Island, Cebu

What is it like? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name “Bantayan sa Hari” (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to “Bantayan,” the name it's known as today.

1.	SYMPHONY OF LIGHTS : Victoria Harbour was a dazzling cityscape on its own, hang around for A Symphony of Lights — the nightly multimedia show involving more than 40 buildings on both sides of the harbour. Named the 'World's Largest Permanent Light and Sound Show' by Guinness World Records, coloured lights, laser beams and searchlights perform in an unforgettable all-round spectacle synchronised to music and narration that celebrates the energy, spirit and diversity of Hong Kong. 

2.	CLOCK TOWER: Standing 44-metres tall, the old Clock Tower was erected in 1915 as part of the Kowloon–Canton Railway terminus. The once-bustling station is long gone, but this red brick and granite tower, now preserved as a t, survives as an elegant reminder of the Age of Steam. It has also been a memorable landmark for the millions of Chinese immigrants who passed through the terminus to begin new lives not just in Hong Kong, but in other parts of the world via the city’s harbour.

3. MADAME TUSSADS HONG KONG: With over 100 incredibly life-like wax figures, Madame Tussauds Hong Kong delivers a fun and interactive celebrity experience in which everyone can either become a star, or just compare themselves to the real thing.

The widely scattered archaeological remains at different places in Arunachal Pradesh bear testimony to its rich cultural heritage. A serene land tucked into the North Eastern tip of India, offers an enchanting experience, with its picturesque hills and valleys, wholesome climate and simple and hospitable people.

The state’s glorious heritage of arts and crafts and colourful festivals reflect the people’s ancient faith in the inexorable power of nature. In addition, the state provides abundant scope for angling, boating, rafting, trekking and hiking. Besides, there are a number of wild life sanctuaries and national parks where rare animals, birds and plants will fascinate the visitor.

Arunachal Pradesh is home to a variety of orchids, known for their exquisitely beautiful blooms, from one of the dominant taxa with more than 600 species, occurring in varying elevations and climatic conditions throughout the state. It is habited by 26 major tribes and a number of sub tribes.

Return flights from Cebu or Manila to Puerto Princesa should cost no more than about php 4500. The van ride from Puerto to El Nido is NOT 850, it should cost about 500-600. I go to Palawan at least twice a year as my fiancée lives there...trust me the people here who have said you should stay away from exclusive and top resorts are right. Find the smaller out of the way places you'll pay much less. Even better get a local to book it..they get better rates always on everything and I mean EVERYTHING. For me I loved El Nido, but if you want boat trips, friendly locals, good food (but not essential electric) then go to Port Barton. I actually preferred Port Barton to El Nido because of its' laid back feel. El Nido can get very busy and full of tourists...it's nowhere near as bad as say Boracay but you don't really get the real feel of the Philippines there.$$i love the philippines not 4 the posh  resots but the true life with the poor & simple people$$Thank you

The people whose lives and livelihood are now dependent on this growing industry in the Philippines called tourism.

Our first story is from @vin_aranas87 (on Instagram) who traveled in May 2015 to Itbayat, #Batanes, the northernmost inhabited island of the Philippines. There, he met their tour guide, Kuya Pepe.

""We met Kuya Pepe on our second day and discussed with him our plans of reaching the #RafangCliffs on the eastern side of #Itbayat. Getting to this place needs some great deal of advice from him as he was the only person allowed to pass through private properties leading to Rafang Cliffs.

""Although he was Marine Engineer by profession, Kuya Pepe chose to stay in the island to be with his family and make a living out of tour-guiding. He explained that being a tour guide has helped him with much of their expenses; he was able to send his kids to school until they finished their studies.

""But aside from the fulfillment he gives his family, he also finds personal joy whenever he sees people enjoying their visit to Itbayat.""

Puerto Princesa, Palawan

How to Get There:
Fly into Puerto Princesa from Busuanga, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo or Manila. 

Fun Fact:
Fish don't just randomly join a group. Like people, they pick who to hang out with – who their mates will be. And generally, they like large shoals with fish who are healthy and resemble their appearance. This is because a fish that stands out will be easy prey.

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one 😂😂 damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london 😍😍 my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it 😂$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin – Singapore’s 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy! It's the most unforgettable dining moment.$$There's this place where you pick what food you want, and it get delivered to you like a speed train on a conveyor belt after the chef has finished your order.",2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Great mountain, white beaches, different tribes are just the many reasons for East Malaysia.  A great close destination, our neighbour, Malaysia Truly Asia.....$$Malaysia offers one of the most ideal destination for travel. Malaysia offers a varied range of activities from the highlands of Cameron Highlands and the lush greenery of the oldest rainforest to the white sandy beaches. There is always that city limelights that beckons you for a night out of fun or self indulgence. The ethnic diversity is shared in the myriad colours in traditional wear, the culinary delight that is shared by all and the warmth welcoming hospitality greeted you as you travel around Malaysia . From the Portugese settlers in Melaka to the unique Baba culture to the 3 main ethnic group, there is always an experience and a sweet memory to savior.$$Truly Malaysia with lots of friendly faces, nice local delights and free from war. Malaysia has lots of facinating places which could reduce our stress life in Singapore$$I love to travel to KL and its outskirts.   It offers both new modern shopping centres of mega scales like One Utama or Midvalley to Hypermarkets like Tesco to wholesale like Kenaga etc and yet you can find diversity in old shops in many areas to pasar malam in different vicinity and the open markets like in Jalan Ara.  Simply love the mood when I can go slow or at a fast pace,  the crowd yet you don't find it claustrophobic , the buzz and lively atmosphere you may find at Pavillion dining boulevard close to midnight and above all I felt relaxed each time I am there.  

The main draw for me is the food scene and you are spoilt for choices.  Each time I am there I never fail to make new discoveries and I am so often thrilled by the gem of the new found place and the smacking good food it offers.  

I indulged in the many nice hotels that abounds in KL and I am a frequent customer of Prince Hotel, my favorite accommodation in KL for its image, service, accessibility and proximity to the shopping belts and a short walk away from the midnight movie that I catch at the Pavillion.   

Taxis have been my favorite mode of transportation, so easily available and I always got a wealth of information on places to drink and dine and places of interest.

Truly it's a haven for tourist like me!$$Warm Malaysian Hospitality,authentic local delights,culture and traditions,homestay,indulge in various village pastimes,agro visits delights of rural living$$I love foremost the exotic beaches at Redang, green lushful mountains in Kedah the hilly stations. Shopping in KLCC is awesome and can never be enough. Foods are finger licking and many Halal certified restaurant. Last but not least, Malaysians are friendly by nature and approachable.$$1st & foremost love to go holiday to Malaysia because of the foods that really appeal to my appetite. Stay in their exclusive 5 star hotel & visit their interesting attractions place that sure brings me & family to go holiday to Malaysia. We plan to go holiday to Kelantan to visit my long penpal when I get to know her I was in my teens.$$From the crystal blue waters around the famed island of Sipadan, where divers are surrounded by turtles, schools of jacks and the chance to dive around the only island that is not connected to any continent. To the idyllic island of Langkawi where one can relax under a beach umbrella at Pantai Cenang idling away your time.

Stopping over in Malacca for the foodie lover and moving on to Kuala Lumpur to indulge more in local food and shopping. To burn away all that excess calories, why not opt being 'Tarzan or Jane' for a day and traverse between tree to tree at SkyTrek Adventure Park? If climbing is not your cup of tea, perhaps exploring Mulu caves in Sarawak may bring you back to nature. 

For the adrenaline junkie, Sepang tracks await you and if you do not have a car to speed your way through the tracks, how about Go-karting instead?

So with that many options available and many more places to explore just a doorstep away, how can Malaysia not attract me over?$$Malaysis is the one of the most pleasant, hassle-free countries to visit in

Model: Alicia Teng ","Review zun bo? don't suka suka ask pretty girl go and eat and give good ratings leh....all your reviews for every place you visit like everything oso good :P . 
At least must got certain criteria mah... or else really feel like paid advertisement, den lidat buey zun liao. 

Haha, anyway my take is their wings are good. Unique texture, taste and crunch. but as for their F&C, i'm wondering if they are using Cod fish, (used traditionally for its texture and quality) or sutchi fish(aka catfish)? There's a difference in terms of taste and value for money.

Cat fish usually not the best choice because of origin of breed and also alot of western food stall use them because its super cheap. Most catfish are frozen so its unlikely to be fresh. Go NTUC and see how much one 500g packet cost, and you be surprise at how much you pay for 2 pcs of fish at that price u pay. 

Okok...i abit bo liao, but do a bit more homework before you recommend can... :P$$With this kind of publicity its going to have long queue like the Michelin soya sauce chicken.

""I guess everyone complained about the salted egg sauce being insufficient so today I got one that I can't even spot the chicken. "" - Bobby Kiran Yeo

The McDonald's send their regards.

But seriously, that's some super fast action taken in response to feedback. So huge props to McDonald's.$$Bish Patcharaporn omg lets try it when were back$$My son just ate and mentioned there isn't any salty egg  taste for the burger. 

Where on earth hv so many duck eggs to be sold since every where is either selling salty egg bread, fish skin crackers, chicken chops, fish & chips and etc.$$I work in mcdonalds. And I too dislike the burger due to its weird smell. Im not a fan of salted egg yolk but truly love to try something new but apparently the pungent smell made me think twice. Furthermore, i believe the salted egg sauce has been absorbed by the bun itself causing it to be dry and no visual of the sauce.$$it's bad.. very bad... the salty egg sauce is so little and dried up, there are more curry leaves than the sauce. a lot of us in Singapore are complaining. don't waste your trip.$$Any food review that gives a thumb up for this burger ....

Taal Lake, Batangas

What is it like? 
Since 1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. The most recent large eruption was on this day back in 1965.  Although considered active, this small volcano has been quiet over the last few decades. As a matter of fact, now there are hiking tours and overnight camping packages on offer.

Fun Fact: 
Want to know what it's like to swim inside a volcano? You can in Crater Lake. It's said that the high sulfuric content has medicinal properties. Some people have even scuba dived here. But don't stay too long. The lake's water also has high concentrations of boron, magnesium, aluminum and sodium in salt form.

We travelled by foot and it was the most satisfying feeling in the world at its peak.$$Md Mehdi Hasanzz Please refrain from posting ads here to avoid being banned. Thank you.$$Yes! This is a great place to take your family for a weekend getaway. I can't wait to visit here again with my husband!$$A big misconception is that many people believe that Taal Volcano is part of Tagaytay City. It's not! It just happened that Tagaytay is one of the highest point in the area where you can have a perfect view of the volcano and lake.

Kakaibang experience pa rin kapag naakyat mo ang bulkan, nakapasok at nakababa sa mismong loob nito kaysa titigan mo lang mula sa malayo.

Tagaytay City however is where one can view both of them. Because of the cool weather and relative cleanliness of this city, it has became the most popular tourist location. It offers comfortable place for busy Manila dwellers. 
Sadly however, development is taking its toll in Tagaytay. Condominiums rise up and threaten its natural scenic beauty. As a resident of Tagaytay, we hope the local government exercise better Urban Planning than other cities.

Have you been here on your #VisitKorea trip? ;)  
 
More info ☞ bit.ly/21bLzXW

Photos courtesy of Seoul Metropolitan Government. ","To South Korea Government Official You Hyun Sik, Kim Su-Jeong & Korea Tourism Board,

You have been quoted in numerous news report claiming that foreigners ripped off by taxi drivers can claim a reward as compensation from the Seoul city government for helping to curb the rampant scams. This email serves to determine whether you are aware that your team is not carrying that out in reality, or if you know that but are simply making empty promises to the media.

I visited Seoul in September last year and unfortunately became a victim of 2 taxi scams. The first taxi driver tampered with the meter to charge me an extra 28,000 KRW. The second taxi driver appeared drunk, stopped multiple times to leave the meter running for extra money while grumbling to himself. When questioned, he turned violent to shout and swing his forearm towards me narrowly missing my forehead.

Trip details and receipts were reported to Seoul Authorities, Mr. Seongmin Lee and Mr. Jongjoong Kim. Thanks to their investigation, the errant taxi drivers were caught, with fines and warnings imposed. Your government officials also asked for my details and shared these with the driver when he promised to bank transfer the extra amount.

This turned out to be a lie - I was subsequently told that the driver only made the promise hoping the police will let him off, and now that he doesn't keep his promise, you government officials cannot do anything about it anyway!? My case was subsequently escalated to your rewards team for the compensation you publicly claimed to protect tourists from what I underwent.

After more than half a year (Sep15 - Present) of sending multiple email & email reminders, making many international phone calls to your office when nobody bothers to reply, I was told that my case is rejected.

The excuse your team gave: The Seoul team said that the taxi driver is from Incheon; the Incheon team said their compensation period started after my incident happened. Both sides refused to compensate. There was no mention on the second driver even though he is from Seoul, no compensation was given either.

Seongmin and Jongjoong helped to scrutinise the Seoul team reward legislations. They confirmed that there is ""no stated restriction for taxis from other municipal areas"", so by right my case perfectly qualifies. Nevertheless, there is little they can do if your rewards team unscrupulously insist on using that excuse which is clearly NOT in the legislation (nor in any of your news report) to avoid compensating tourists . Hence, my decision to take this directly to you and the South Korea Tourism Board.

It is bad enough that your taxis are out to scam tourists. Now even the Seoul government are trying to shirk responsibility, coming up with excuses using newly-imagined regulation to avoid compensating tourists & wasting 8 months of our time. With the authorities setting such a bad example in keeping promises, it is no wonder your taxi driver dares to promise compensation to the police then break his promise after that - He is just following in your footsteps!

Please take this as a public request for You Hyun Sik, Kim Su-Jeong & the tourism board to look into my case for compensation. Also take this as a public service announcement so that other tourists will not foolishly believe your word that the Seoul government authorities is actually protecting and compensating tourists ripped off by your taxi drivers.

Originated by the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, Eid'l Fitr is a cause for celebration and thanksgiving to Allah. It was proclaimed a national holiday in the Philippines since 2002, and was the first predominantly Christian country to do so. This proclamation was intended to foster peace and goodwill between major religions in the Philippines. Most Filipino-Muslims gather together on this day to celebrate the month long feast of Ramadan. ","Widely celebrated? it was declared a national holiday but few only knows about it.$$The Philippines is a Catholic Country and once again we have to let outsiders in and change the country.

This is all against my beliefs.$$An amazing testimony on spell caster who brought my Ex over back to me.

My name is MARVIS MARCEL from KENYA and I'm happily married to a lovely and caring

husband,with two kids.A very big problem occurred in my family seven months ago,between me and my husband.so terrible that he took the

case to court for a

divorce.he said that he never wanted to stay with me again,and that he didn't love me anymore.So he packed out of my house

and made me and

my children passed through several pain. I tried all my possible means to get her back,after much begging,but all to no avail.and he

confirmed it that he has made her decision,and he never wanted to see me again.

So on one evening,as i was coming back from work,i met an old friend of mine who asked of my husband.So i explained every thing to

her,so he told me that the only way i can get my husband back,is to visit a spell caster,because it has really worked for her too.So i never

believed in spell,but i had no other choice,than to follow her advice. Then he gave me the email address of the spell caster whom

he visited spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com So the next morning,i sent a mail to the address he gave to me,and the spell caster

assured me that i will get my husband back the next day.What an amazing statement!! I never believed,so he spoke with me,and told me

everything that i need to do. Then the next morning, So surprisingly, my husband who didn't call me for the past seven {7}months, gave

me a call to inform me that he was coming back.So Amazing!! So that was how he came back that same day,with lots of love and

joy,and he apologized for her mistake,and for the pain he caused me and my children. Then from that day,our relationship was now

stronger than how it were before,by the help of a spell caster.

So, i will advice you out there to kindly contact him through his email spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com if you are in any condition

like this,or you have any problem related to ""bringing your ex Husband or husband, Girfriend back.

So thanks to DR Sambo for bringing back my husband,and brought great joy to my family once again. spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com

Zambales, Luzon

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Zambales from Caloocan or Cubao (seven hours).

What is it?
In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

Why do you think they made a statue of a dog? ","That is a good theory!  Do you have a dog statue in your backyard Tina?  hehe  I should have one... my dear puppy passed away last year.  

Marie$$aww I'm sorry to hear that....don't have a backyard yet but I really couldn't tell you why they have a statue of a dog....might be significant in some way but dogs are always loyal creatures..$$Thanks George!  Very useful information.  What do you do?$$I was going to say that the native dog of Korea, the Sapsalgae, is a dog found in the south-eastern part of the Korean Peninsula. It has been designated a natural monument in Gyeongsan which is the neighbouring county of Gyeongju. . These dogs have been bred exclusively as house dogs; their 'work' spiritual rather than physical. Traditionally, these dogs were believed to dispel ghosts and evil spirits and even misfortune
But then the dogs in the picture don’t look anything like the Sapsalgae nor the Chinese spitz. Just a wild guess.
$$Can you tell me the name of the temple? My hometown is 20 min away from Gyeongju and I went there like once a week, but I never see that... $$By the way, we don't eat dogs. Perhaps a small amount of people might consider it as a delicacy.. it's sickening.. but don't tar everyone with the same brush.. And the British have pigs blood (Black puddings). 

A good intro:
The Korean Jindo Dog (Hangul: 진돗개; Hanja: 珍島개) is a breed of a hunting dog  known to have originated on Jindo Island  in Korea. Although relatively unknown outside Korea, it is celebrated in its native land for its fierce loyalty and brave nature.$$The name of the temple is 골굴사 (Golgulsa), and this statue is located along the path before you reach the temple.$$Some good guesses here- I think to protect the temple is probably the best bet. but, just to add another theory: Could it be to remember the breeds that were made extinct during Japanese occupation?
Although Michael's comment was kind of rude, Kerry, I don't think you can say 'only a small amount' of Koreans eat dog meat- There are 4 
보신탕 restaurants in my neighborhood, and a number of my coworkers, students, and friends have tried or eat it once or twice a year...$$I agree, I think that Michael's comment is very rude. I also don't think that you can even generalize a ""small amount"" of anything. Some people eat dog but some Hispanics eat Guinea Pigs and some Mormons are polygamous... I personally don't feel that the comment made about dogs being delicious should be included without explanation- I feel like it's Mr. Doyle just trying to be funny and failing. 

But I think that the dog is super cute and that maybe it is a symbol of Chinese influence on Korea. Maybe it was constructed in the year of the dog?$$Perhaps A tribute the dish Kagogi (Kay-go-ghee). I was invited to a traditional wedding of one of the Korean Army compound commanders daughter while stationed there they had Kagogi.
 The South Korean dog meat industry reportedly involves about 1 million dogs, 6,000 restaurants, and 10 percent of the population.  In South Korea there is currently several laws in place that while the laws don't exactly make the sale of dog meat illegal they do make the method of euthanizing canines a lot more palatable and humane.
The chickens I saw in market were live. You chose the bird you wanted, they shoved a ice pick in the hart and put in a feather plucking machine and you took it home and cleaned it at home.
I did not ask the process of getting the meat for the Kagogi. Whether they carried it home in a bag or on a leash but I do know they usually only use dogs bread and raised for that purpose.
Now there is a vast difference in the way things are done in the country and big city's and the way they think and do things.
Yes they do eat Dog meat.$$it's a story of a dog, Haciko$$Ronald I think that is true in most countries that they do things differently in the city than they do in the country. No matter what level of ""civilization"" we reside in the country folk still tend to be old school on the techniques for most things.$$Hachiko is in Japan so Im wondering about this one in Korea..hmmmmmm...",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Anilao, Batangas

What is it like? 
Soft corals prefer nutrient-rich waters and less light. They may look like plants, but corals are marine animals that need food. And this type feeds on zooplankton, or organisms incapable of swimming against a current – making it the ideal treat for hungry marine creatures. You can find soft corals in Anilao's colorful underwater gardens, which are home to all sorts of tropical fish.

Fun Fact:

What is it?
Aguinaldo Shrine is the ancestral home of General Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the first Republic of the Philippines. It was from the balcony of this house that the Philippine flag was formally unfurled. Aguinaldo donated his home to the Philippine government in June 12, 1963 ""to perpetuate the spirit of the Philippine Revolution of 1896 that put an end to Spanish colonization of the country.""

Fun Fact:
The Aguinaldo house is filled with antique furniture and decors with the flag motifs, but most interesting are the secret passages and hiding places within the house.

_______

Three months after kicking off 2016 with a social media contest, the Department of Tourism (DOT) announced on Friday, 19 February 2016, the three winners of the photo-fail challenge, each bagging a trip for two back to the Philippines. The contest encouraged foreign visitors to post their best photo-fails taken in the islands, highlighting their fun and candid experiences in the country.

Bannered under the theme ""Visit the Philippines Again 2016,"" this year's tourism campaign aims to attract repeat visitors and new travelers alike to come visit the country and relive the fun experiences they had with their friends, loved ones, and even strangers-turned-friends.

Photo-fail images submitted by Jarne Uytersprot from Belgium, Chintai Kato from Japan, and Kaisa Kapanen from Finland were chosen among thousands who submitted their photos. These photo-fails highlighted off-guard moments of tourists while having fun in the Philippines.

Launched at the World Travel Mart in London, England last November, the social media contest invited foreign passport holders who have been to the Philippines to upload their own photo-fail versions on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook with the official hashtag #visitphilippinesagain2016. Winners of the contest will get a chance to re-do their photos taken in some of the top vacation destinations in the country.

""This social media campaign was our way to heighten up the excitement for big events lined up for the Philippines this year. 2016 is the year of 'again' and 'Visit the Philippines Again' will once more highlight the country as a multi-level experience destination filled with exciting activities and endless new discoveries, shared with their warm and fun-loving hosts, the Filipino people,"" says Tourism Secretary Ramon R. Jimenez, Jr.

Among the big events lined up this year are the Routes Asia 2016, Madrid Fusion Manila 2016, Flavors of the Philippines, Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2016, 2016 Ironman 70.3 Asia Pacific Championship, MTV Music Evolution 2016, the World Street Food Congress, and the Travel Blog Exchange (TBEX). The recent months also witnessed the Philippines' hosting of the ASEAN Tourism Forum in Manila and the World Eucharistic Congress in Cebu.

""Perhaps we should focus on what we have in common -- Singaporeans and Malaysians are united by a common love for food.""

Let's just appreciate each other's food okay!The long-standing debate has been reignited: Whose food is better, Malaysia's or Singapore's?

Some Malaysians online have said their food is better, and slammed a few classic Singapore dishes. This won't end well...

https://mustsharenews.com/malaysia-singapore-food/","So if Singapore's food is nicer, does that increase our GDP? So if Malaysia's food is nicer, do their citizens become richer? There are lots of bigger problems to worry about than to squabble over something stupid like whose food is nicer 🙄$$I'm a half&half, both SG n MY food carries their own charisma. Good in their ways.

Even among Malaysians, coming from different states can have different tastebuds. 

Some prefer this, some prefer that.

Having said so, I never wan to order kway teow soup wen in SG. Too bland for me. But I can have kway teow soup in Penang everyday whenever I'm there. My last trip I even lug in 3 kg of kway teow from Penang wet market before my flight home to SG.$$It comes down to the fact that Malaysia gives you more bang for your buck. It can't be helped with their currency crashing past 3 to 1, they are just much better in value. Skill aside, for the same price, the portions are better, the materials used are better. We can't compete with the cheap ringgit nor should we really want to.$$Got nothing to do with money or the exchange rate. I'm Singaporean born and bred but having lived in Malaysia for 13 years, nothing compares to Malaysian food hands down. Mamak culture is amazing not just for the food but the company.$$'local food' wise, SG really out la. With the less salt less sugar less this and that health conscious shit. Tasteless AF. 
Well, some place do have nice crab beehoon, frog porridge and that's all. 
Wan tan mee, Char Kuey Teow, BKT Yada Yada all CMI. 
International food wise (hotel buffets, Japs, Kor) SG wins by light years even when compared with our capital KL. Honestly.$$Suggestion: Make 2 people eat only 1 of each version, all day every day, for a month. And then allow them to swap. Then ask again which is ""better"". 👍$$now herbal soup, bak kuet teh all taste like salt water. Lor Mee cooked by china cooks got smell no taste. chicken rice e rice so salty e meat very bland. if give me chance to try, i will try malaysia food. food cook by malaysian chinese cook is better. their taste and our very close.$$I love both versions of hokkien mee and bak ku teh. My most memorable chicken rice was 30 years ago at a restaurant in old Klang road. Didn't think it exist anymore.  Believe the secret is in the source of the chicken.$$Singapore better: chicken rice, kaya toast (because the price allows thicker butter), Chilli crab, noodle soup

Malaysia: everything else except the above$$The two countries were and still are tied by kinship and history and families values. Don't let the boundaries blur this valuable human comnection$$Wah. Countries so insecure in their culture they need to hold competitions to see which one is better.$$With more oil, more salt and more 'you don't know what', of course m'sia food are better taste.$$To all .be thank full that we have such good food in both state. Not like in some country where even  brinking water hard to get.$$Food is best only to you.  What I love may the thing you hate.$$Food taste like shit is because no one wants to learn how to cook..or they are not interested so ..what can you expect..$$Malaysia boleh and cheaper. Singapore now mostly PRC cooks behind cooking your Bak Chor mee and what's not.$$Because all our good food like Hokkien mee is at least 12 ringgit to them so they never eat before! Hahaha.$$no point to compare. more practical to compare local dishes with the same dish.$$Taste wise, for health sake, i would think sg is better. not to mention abt hygiene !$$Why bother who is better. Just continue to compete and make food even more amazing for everyone. Burp.....$$singapore food now mostly cooked by foreginers like chinese, korean, japanese food in food court now mostly cook by china ppl.$$Some people keep searching for cheaper deals, some people learn how to make more money.

You want more fun in the Philippines? The 100 islands are a must see. 
Wanna go swimming? Diving? Snorkeling? Beach-Camping? Riding an island-to-island zipline? Sight-seeing? Then the Hundred Islands Tour is just the thing for you..and it's cheap too!Fantastic, amazing islands. Nature at its finest. The boat people were so courteous. Everyone travelling to Pangasinan must come here and see for yourself. It is very tourist friendly. The water was crystal clear and we very much enjoyed the snorkeling. Be sure to go snorkeling and try some of the other activities like fishing or kayaking if you have the time and don't forget your camera!                                                                 #TagtheFun

#itsmorefuninthephilippines$$One of the reasons why I decided to travel this butt-numbing ride to Bicol is to witness the long-heard perfection of Mayon Volcano. And as I found myself closer to it, I was able to see its cracks and edges, its bumps and its imperfections. So I have learned that what other people, books, news and magazines have said and continue saying is wrong. But the thing is, I didn't find myself disappointed of seeing it just because of those things; for it taught me lessons I will forever treasure.  1. What other people see, think or say is not always right. Sometimes you have to see it for yourself to prove it.  2. There are few things that do not have to be perfect for you to love them. It will always get down to acceptance of the flaws rather than pointing of what is wrong.  And 3. Like Quentin, I disagree to Margo when she said that everything is uglier closer. Sometimes there's beauty in knowing what it is really like.  Like in us humans, some people are afraid to let others in because of the fear of being too exposed; that those people might use it to judge them; but it is not always like that.  There are still few that when they get to know you better, when they discover what you truly are, they will still understand, accept and love for whatever you are. But just a piece of advice, you still have to be careful of choosing who to expose your life with.#TagTheFun#ItsmorefuninthePhilippines#tpbgovph$$White Cove Beach Resort, Laiya, Batangas

Kalimpong has for long been in the shadows of its better known big brother – Darjeeling. Situated between the Deolo and Durbindra Hills at the foot of the mighty Himalayas, the landscape of this famous hill station in the state of West Bengal is a feast for one's eyes. 

51 km east of Darjeeling and at an altitude of 1250 metres, Kalimpong is a blaze of colour throughout the year thanks to the richness of its breathtaking flora. Apart from being a place to head to escape the heat of the plains, Kalimpong is the reminiscent of an English town, with faded, elegant buildings evocative of another era.

(“Tori” is one of the 12 signs of oriental zodiac).
And in many shrines in Japan, there will be “Tori-no-Ichi” festival held.
The one in Ohtori Shrine, Asakusa in Tokyo is the most famous of all.
The decorations you can see in the pictures are called “Kumade,” a rake and the Kumade is a good luck charm for business, happiness, and fortune.
It is said that we will have a better luck if we buy “Kumade” bigger than the one we bought last year.  The bigger, the better.
Would you like to hang it on the wall of your house?
