I really really like to win a Korea trip because I have never ever been there yet. And my sis kept going Korea several times for 4 yrs consecutively. She has been telling me so much great things Korea offer and the nice places she has been to were so lovely and pretty. That gave me lots of insights and more urges to visit Korea so badly!!!! If I really win, I will first indulge in their Korea food because I want to taste how authentic their food is and will take lots of food pics as my spouse & I are food lovers!!! My desired #shopping item will be their food that we can't never get in Singapore and I probably will spend about S$200 on #souvenirs as I heard Korea has many handcrafted goodies. My spouse & i will be deeply grateful if I win this fantastic holiday and I intend to go during this coming December for a super white, cold Xmas to spend a lovely and memorable Korea trip for the 1st time in my life!!!

Many guys just admire pretty girls from afar, hoping they could talk to them. Picking up girls is an intricate art, but we got it down to a science. Here's something new from our ""Talking to Strangers"" series.


Our aim is simply to help more Singaporeans meet each other, so they have more options and find more suitable partners for themselves. But this guide is not for everyone. If just the thought of girls being 'picked up' offends you, please don't read it.

http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/pick-up-girls-sgMany guys just admire pretty girls from afar, hoping they could talk to them. Picking up girls is an intricate art, but we got it down to a science. Here\'s how.","There are so many things I could say about this article but I will limit them to the ones I can articulate well in the short amount of time I have. In an article entitled ""how to pick up girls"" promoting the woman as ""equal"" and not a ""prey' is mind-boggling if not shocking. As a woman, I am not sure how to feel, upset or pleased. Secondly, if the motive of the article is to ""find suitable partnerships"" I am not sure your title and some of the recommended tips, some of the language used is achieving the purpose. I  normally enjoy your postings, however, (as a recently returned Singaporean to Singapore and a humanitarian) if this describes in  nutshell how the  courtship processes begin then it speaks volumes (not heart-warming ones) about the moral and social fabric of the society. As an influential source that I'd like to believe your website is, I'd love to see ways of reforming this pretty sorry state.$$Ben Tan haha you know I find this article funny. I find this whole thing funny. Women preach equality and independance and strength.. you know what I wanna see? For once I'd like to see a girl with balls--yes BALLS--big enough to walk up to a guy she likes and talk to him. Not just stand there like some sexual butterfly giving out pheromones like she's queen bee. And while she's at it, how bout she pay for her own damn first date because chivalry is a girl's worst expectation. The guy doesn't even know if you're worth it and yet he's paying for you?! TIMES HAVE CHANGED PEOPLE. Foot your own bill, talk to guys, stop eye-fucking them, and for goodness sake don't expect a guy to impress you because he doesn't need your requirements of him. He doesn't need you to tick off your checklist in your pretty little heads because he actually loves from the heart. Wanna be equal? Here's a formula for you. LOVE IS A TWO WAY STREET. It's not about picking up girls. It's tough love people, deal with it.
Yours Sincerely
From a guy that picks up girls$$"" if Player 2 isn't ready, the game can't commence. You are not entitled to her just because you're showering her with attention.""

Miriam is battling lung cancer. It is a fact. Miriam is sick. Miriam may die anytime. But, just like all men, Binay, Poe, Duterte and Roxas may die also anytime. Miriam is just sick, but remains highly capable. Everyone knows that on the basis of qualification, all candidates, except Miriam remains on top. It is a fact.

Miriam ran in 1992 for president. She won the votes, but lost in the counting. Cory Aquino's ally Fidel Ramos won. Miriam did not surrender the fight. She ran as senator of this republic. She worked hard as legislature. She has been an RTC Judge, Agrarian Secretary, Immigration Commissioner, and United Nations ICC Judge. 

Miriam has no ""City"" to base her competence. And Miriam has no 3-6 month-worth of promises. But, she has all her bills, laws, and track records to prove her worth. Decades ago, before the rise of Duterte, Poe, Binay and Roxas, Miriam has been the Master of Anti-Corruption and Anti-Crime. She was there since then and until now. 

Unlike other presidential candidates, even Miriam lost once, she is still now trying to succeed the Presidential race in 2016. This is a symbol of #persistence and #perseverance. This is the will to win!

This country needs a #wise president to decide where this country will be heading. We need a leader who has a strong conviction and philosophy. We need a leader who has law and governance #expertise. We need a leader who can be a #model to all members of the society especially the youth. We need a leader who has the capability to handle #international concerns. We need a leader who is respected by majority not because of his dictatorial skills, but because of his #wisdom to steward this republic. 

We need a leader who has #academic, #professional and #moral#excellence. We need a leader like #Miriam. 

We need a leader with #decency, #quality, #professionalism and #integrity. #credibility, #Dignity,  #honest.  Strong,  Brave and Bold ! Intellectually Brilliant Leader! WORLD  CLASS LEADER!

We need Miriam. 

Why would you vote for someone ""lesser evil"" or someone ""good enough"" if there is someone like ""best choice."" 

Why would I vote for Duterte, Roxas, Binay, or Poe, if there is Miriam. 

Why would I settle for ""siya na ang iboboto ko kahit na ganun siya"" if there is something like 
""Siya ang iboboto ko kasi siya ang talaga ang tama at dapat.""

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/underrated-foods-singaporeLooking for the best local food that few people know about? We recommend 10 local dishes that are often overlooked. #1 is quickly becoming a hot favourite.","LOL nice try but the only acceptable alternative to chilli crab is black pepper crab and while I agree that duck is splendid alternative to chicken rice, it's better with those thick yellow noodles and sweet dark gravy and chilli sauce rather than rice. As for an ""alternative"" to laksa - there is no such thing - laksa rules. Especially the stall at East Coast park on the right by the road entrance. To say otherwise is delusional 😊",2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

xPower PB10Q Power Bank is the best for me! I travel at least once a month and quick power charging, slim and light charger are very attractive features of this power bank!! Not only that, I can also share this power bank with my BF too!

3) my baby device (my baby have her tab for kids)
4) my wife phone
5) for any other device needed$$need that xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger!! 

adapters for different countries are such a pain to begin with, let alone needing to charge everything I need to charge via USB from iPhone to GoPro to Power Bank to Quodos Light. (wah, see, 4 items, just nice)

no more fighting for power with my Macbook, Camera Batteries, Flash Batteries, omg - everyone travelling with me will hate me less for hogging all the power but anyways!! 

then they should just get their own xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger + power bank too hahahaa.$$Would love to have xPower PB10Q Power Bank... Always wanting to travel and capture my favourite moments. But somehow my phone goes into Low battery and did not have the chance to take my special moment! Hope this will help enhance my gadget efficacies...esp when I'm a gadget amateur!! Hope to win this!!$$Liked and shared! I would like to win the xPower PB10Q Power Bank as a birthday gift for my boyfriend! I think these power banks are made for people like my boyfriend who on internet for 24 hours, playing games, researching, snapping pictures especially, navigating at the same time even when overseas. We love traveling and will travel at least once or twice a year therefore, we really like to own this powerful gadget! (:$$i would say that xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save me when i am travelling, i need to charge my portable wifiegg and phone so that i can last a day with wifi when i travel !$$The charger is a lifesaver especially when I depend on my iPhone to capture moments on top of communicating and navigating. I also like to share the moments I capture and also revisit them during my free time. This charger ensures that there will never be a moment I can't capture. The multi 5 USB ports just makes things even better! Now 4 other friends enjoy such certainty as well (:$$I need that xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger during travelling. There's limited power supplies in the hotel room. Sometimes, u will forget to bring power extension too.

It's always a pain to charge everything at night from phones to cameras, flash batteries to Power Bank. With this awesome xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger, there will be no more hogging to the power supplies! :)$$I would love to gift the xPower WC3QT travel charger to my boyfriend as he often charges his devices (laptop and especially phone as he always play game)! It's important that he gets all his devices charged up and be ready for both school and work, and also when we travel together at a later time of this year! Since he's such a forgetful person, this multi-functional charger would benefit him a lot!$$I m always lugging around 3 portable batteries as I need to charge my iPhone and iPad! Please rescue my shoulders as they are aching everyday from the load I carry. I need xPower DC5S Charger to charge my iPad, my phone and my portable fan to keep me from fainting in this heatwave.$$The xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save my life because my phone's battery life is quite short. It would definitely need a mid-day charge if im using it actively as my GPS$$I think the xPower PB10Q Power Bank would be very apt to save my life from a dead phone. It's less a question of need but one of want, as my current portable charger is good for one charge and is the size of a KitKat. So this is less of an entry into a lucky draw, but more of a plea for a better, longer, phone life. PLEEEEEEAAAASSSEEEE$$xPower DC5S Charger will save my life whenever I'm overseas cos the number of available sockets in hotel rooms are either too far apart till my items are everywhere or there are simply not enough sockets for me to charge my phone/dslr battery/portable charger. With this, at least I can consolidate all my tech devices together without having to worry about leaving one behind! :)$$Liked & shared. I hope I can win the xPower DC5S Charger as I'll be going overseas next month & my family of 4 will be squeezing in one hotel room! This means that we need to fight for the electrical sockets to charge our devices when we reached back in our hotel room. So it would be perfect to owe the xPower DC5S Charger to increase the efficiency by charging so many our devices at the same time! Furthermore, the added advantage of the xPower DC5S Charger is that it comes with a removable handphone stand so that our devices will not be wandering around and we can save the hassle of finding them! :-)$$Liked and shared!

I definitely need the xPower DC5S Power, though it's a close fight with   xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger.

Given that I usually travel with someone else, getting enough power points for our numerous gadgets is a massive headache.

Count this: Camera (ok, not fair to count it cos it doesn't use USB but it does take up one power point on its own), portable power bank, phone, tablet, smart watch, and iPod (yes, I'm old skool... Cos I don't wanna drain my phone's batt.) and then multiply by the number of travelers and you roughly get the idea of how many power points we will need if not for the multi-USB charger. I can bring my own travel adaptor for just one charger and that's it.

Wei Ling Bimira, you'll agree...$$xPower DC5S Charger will definitely be a life-saver, not only for myself, but for fellow travellers in my group, especially on long road trips with no power source in sight. =)$$Item: the xPower PB10Q Power Bank. I need it to charge my phone whenever it runs out of battery whilst im overseas. Caused me to not be able to take photos and even, record beautiful moments.$$xPower PB10Q Power Bank will be my life saver!
I'm a heavy phone user and can't last a few hours without my phone!

Liked and shared$$xPower PB10Q Power Bank will be my life saviour because I am a very heavy phone user and i would die without it hahahaha$$xPower DC5S Charger save all of us life when we go camping or travel around.. we can charges all of our gadgets at the same time.

I love the Korea furniture museum  

Since years now i really like and i love deeply  to visit museums when travelling to new places. I think this is because museums tell me a lot about the culture of those places.
Museums are also fun. It’s almost impossible to get bored in a museum. Every museum will have at least one thing of interest to somebody.When visiting someplace new, you can find out about the culture of that place in many ways. You can go to a movie or a place of worship or a nightclub. Another option is to sit in the park and listen to the people around you. The easiest way to learn about a place’s culture, though, is by visiting its museums. Museums will show you the history of the place you’re visiting. They’ll show you what art the locals think is important.
Museums are also fun. Even if you’re not interested in art or history, there is always something to get your attention. Many museums now have what they call “hands-on” exhibits. These were originally designed to keep children occupied while their parents were looking at exhibits. However, museums have found that adults enjoy hands-on opportunities just as much as children. These exhibits have activities like pushing a button to hear more about what you’re looking at, creating your own work of art, or trying on clothes like those on the models in the museum.
People also enjoy visiting museums about unusual subjects. For instance, in my hometown there’s a museum devoted to the potato. This museum has art made out of potatoes. It also tells all about the history of the potato, and sells potato mementos like key chains and potato dolls.
People enjoy visiting this museum because it’s different. It’s not something they’d find in their hometown and the museum’s curator enjoys talking about the Great Potato. Museums are popular because they are about us. They reflect our creations, our values, and our dreams. No matter who you are or what you like, somewhere there is a museum that will amaze and interest you.
I could say it loudly i have been given the chance to visit the  Korea furniture museum  which is in fact a wonderful museum which is an extra ordinary place to visit and to live in the heart of the korean culture 
 I really like this musim since i have visit it in 2009

The common trait binding all three communities is its matrilineal system in which the family linage is taken from the mother's side.

Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and Sicogon Development Corporation (SIDECO) will launch Sicogon Island Tourism Estate development within the first half of 2016.

The ALI-SIDECO joint venture is expected to drive economic progress in Western Visayas and the entire region as it serves as a tourism hub for surrounding or nearby destinations like Gigantes, Bantayan and Concepcion islands.

The 1,100-hectare Sicogon Island will feature a balanced mix of developments, such as a resort town center, hotels and resorts, as well as commercial and residential establishments, supported by an on-site airstrip.  The ground breaking of the airport runway is scheduled for the second half of the year.

“The initial development will concentrate on building the airport and runway, to ensure accessibility to the island,” said Jose Emmanuel Jalandoni, ALI Senior vice president and group head of commercial business.  “The 1.3-kilometer runway will allow immediate access from Manila and Cebu to the island development,” he added, saying further that test flights to Sicogon are being targeted for the first quarter of 2017.

The project is supported by public, private and community organizations, and government bodies alike because of the potential economic benefits it will bring to the region.  A framework agreement was signed by ALI, SIDECO, and the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk Association (FESIFFA) in 2014 to pave the way for the sustainable development of Sicogon Island.  The group has been assisting the local community through skills training and livelihood programs to make them active partners in the development.

“We strongly believe and hope that poverty alleviation will be achieved through tourism projects.  These will give us various job opportunities and help us improve farming and fishing methods,” said Raul Ramos, president of FESIFFA.

Jalandoni stressed that sustainability will be a main focus of the project.  Aside from allocating more than 50% of the development for open green space, ALI will also work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to continue stewardship of Sicogon’s forested area, and work on coastal protection and marine life rehabilitation in support of sustainable development.

“More than becoming a premier tourist destination and a tourism hub for the region, Sicogon is envisioned to provide inclusive growth and economic development through long-term recovery and livelihood programs, and job creation,” said Jalandoni.

ALI estimates that the Sicogon Island development will provide 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly with increased tourism, and approximately P1 billion in earnings for the community through business opportunities that will come from the retail and commercial establishments.

#itsmorefuninthephilippines$$One of the reasons why I decided to travel this butt-numbing ride to Bicol is to witness the long-heard perfection of Mayon Volcano. And as I found myself closer to it, I was able to see its cracks and edges, its bumps and its imperfections. So I have learned that what other people, books, news and magazines have said and continue saying is wrong. But the thing is, I didn't find myself disappointed of seeing it just because of those things; for it taught me lessons I will forever treasure.  1. What other people see, think or say is not always right. Sometimes you have to see it for yourself to prove it.  2. There are few things that do not have to be perfect for you to love them. It will always get down to acceptance of the flaws rather than pointing of what is wrong.  And 3. Like Quentin, I disagree to Margo when she said that everything is uglier closer. Sometimes there's beauty in knowing what it is really like.  Like in us humans, some people are afraid to let others in because of the fear of being too exposed; that those people might use it to judge them; but it is not always like that.  There are still few that when they get to know you better, when they discover what you truly are, they will still understand, accept and love for whatever you are. But just a piece of advice, you still have to be careful of choosing who to expose your life with.#TagTheFun#ItsmorefuninthePhilippines#tpbgovph$$White Cove Beach Resort, Laiya, Batangas

#DiscoverWonderfulIndonesia ","Taman Sari also known as Taman Sari Water Castle is a site of a former royal garden of the Sultanate of Yogyakarta. It is located about 2 km south within the grounds of the Kraton, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Built in mid 18th century, the Taman Sari had multiple functions, such as a resting area, a workshop, a meditation area, a defense area, and a hiding place.

Taman Sari consisted of four distinct areas: a large artificial lake with islands and pavilions located in the west, a bathing complex in the centre, a complex of pavilions and pools in the south, and a smaller lake in the east. Today only the central bathing complex is well preserved, while the other areas have been largely occupied by the Kampung Taman settlement.

Since 1995 the Yogyakarta Palace Complex including Taman Sari is listed as a tentative World Heritage Site.$$Taman Sari comes from the Javanese words, where ""taman"" is garden and ""sari"" means beautiful, Beautiful Garden.

Among those who benefit from the earnings generated by Tourism are locals from touristic destinations who derive livelihood from it. Take the case of Kuya Eran Decena whose story is told by Cyrus John Malonzo (@the_boy_who_leaves on Instagram). 

""During my 2nd trip to #Coron, I met Kuya Eran Decena, who happens to be one of the well-known tour guides in town. He was famous that he was even featured on travel publication, Lonely Planet.

""My interaction with him indeed proved why he was well-known. First, he is very engaging and funny; there was no dull moment as we travelled from one island to the next. Second, he knows a lot about Coron, from affordable boat rides and accommodations to various detours for delicious local delicacies. And third, you can feel his love for his hometown, especially when he shared his efforts during the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda in Coron, as well as his concerns about commercial developments that pose threats on the island's pristine beauty.

""He said that when he started as a tour guide 15 years ago, there was only a handful of European foreigners visiting Coron. But with more flights and ferries leading to their town, the influx of local tourists has helped sustain their means of living. 

""He used to live in Manila and worked as a messenger for a multinational company before deciding to become a tour guide. I felt that he made the right decision because he is enjoying his job. He even promotes scenic photos of Coron on his own Facebook page. And I sincerely hope that when I get the chance to visit Coron again, he will still sport the same smile that we saw from him two years ago.""

Like many other harvest festivals around the world,it is held around the autumn .
Harvesting preparation
Nabanna (New Crop) is a Bengali harvest celebration usually celebrated with food and dance and music in Bangladesh and in the Indian State of West Bengal. It is a festival of food; many local preparations of Bengali cuisine like pithe are cooked and offered.

The festival is celebrated with mela which are called nabanna mela. It is one of the numerous festivals that gave the name ""baro mase tero parban"" (thirteen festivals in twelve months ) to the land of Bengal. Although the nabanna parban is somewhat different from other ones since it is not connected to a religion such as Ratha Yatra. The villagers and locals from both the major religious groups join the festival with equal participation. There are also several fertility rituals which make the festival truly a harvest ritual. The festival gets a lot of support from the creative army of Bengali culture. Several poets, musicians, baul and painters flock to such mass gatherings. There is a famous play written on nabanna by Bijon Bhattacharya which depicts the sad incident of the great Bengal Famine of 1943.[1] Nowadays the Festival ""Nabanna"" is celebrating every Bengali year (1st day of Agrahayan) in Dhaka, organized by Jatiya Nabanna Utshab Udjapan Parshad (National Harvest Festival committee) since 1998. Mr. Shahriar Salam is main planner of the organization. There are huge number of cultural activists, organizations & performing in a day long festival. Traditional Dance, Song & Rally arranging by the Committee. Once upon a time 1st Agrahayan was the first day of Bengali New Year. It is a non communal festival in Bengal.

Below is a description found in west Bengal on one such mela website.

""people from several villages of Howrah and even from other districts of West Bengal come here. People not only come to visit the Mela. In addition, they participate in many cultural programmes and competitions like 'Pithe Making' (Preparation of different sorts of Bengali Cakes), Seat-and Draw, Senior Citizens' Walking Competition etc. An ""Art-Camp"" may attract creative minded people where artists from different states will participate. Some rare items of rural Bengal as ""Dhenki"" (Old-style Domestic Rice Mill), paddy of different varieties directly from the farmers' house are to be exhibited in the Exhibition ground. You can taste some delicious Bengali dishes like Pati-sapta, Payesh (the latest addition is 'Vegetable Payesh'), Jilipipi (not Jilipi) etc. during the festival. Bengal's time-honoured culture and heritage will be presented to you in forms of Baul song, Chhou-dance, Jatra, Tarja, Kobi-gaan, etc. These artists come from different parts of the state to perform their talent and expertise in front of thousands of appreciative gatherings. Moreover, you can refurbish your collection of folk arts from the 'exhibition-cum-sale' stalls of handicrafts made by rural artisans.""[2]$$추석 잘 보내세요~~~

It is said that originally, the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival came about as a way for parents to make up for lost time with their children after harvest season. The harvest was done by September, (August in the Lunar calendar) and the parents were anxious to spend time with their children and do something special with them, as well as celebrate the harvest, after spending much time working hard and away from the family. It was held under the full moon, which represents fullness and prosperity of life.

Tet Trung Thu is very much like a combination of our Halloween and Thanksgiving. Children parade on the streets, while singing and carrying colorful lanterns of different sizes. Some of the popular shapes include fishes, stars, butterflies and a lantern that spins when a candle is inserted, representing the earth circling the sun.

Dances are also traditional, and include the dragon dance and the flower dance.

It is customary to give Banh Trung Thu, boxes of moon cakes, which are traditionally very rich in taste. The cakes are filled with lotus seeds, ground beans and orange peels and have a bright yoke in the center to represent the moon.

Today, the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, as well as encouraging affection for children, promotes education, poetry, dance and arts and crafts.$$Today, we celebrate Trung Thu (Mid-Autumn Festival) in Vietnam too.

When DARUMA is sold, both eyes are not painting. When you purchased it, you draw an iris on left eye. And when your wish came true, you paint an iris on right eye.

So i did my own research, there are 100s so couldn’t decide. However a friend recently told me about a home whitening kit because she had good results. I had to search for it online as it’s usually only given as part of an after care solution once you’ve has laser teeth whitening, but they now sell them separately. 

It’s called White Guard home teeth whitening kit, it’s non peroxide so claims it won’t damage teeth. It worked really well for me, but that’s no guarantee it will for you. And no i’m not being paid/sponsored, i’m just a regular girl who has no affiliation to any supplier of products. 

I’m just cynical about independent reviews as the same mags and publications trot out the same brands pushing the same products day after day, do they think we are stupid or sheep. If you’ve found a product via your own research and testing that turns out to be really good, do same as me and add to comments section for such products so that real women like me and you aren’t being sold the usual suspects and get to try other good products.

This is part of our undercover review series.

Model: Symone Oei ","Just visited. Nice ambience, free wifi, TVs all over, kids corner was a nice touch. 

Ordered the dinner set, after some time asked them when's the food coming and they asked ""so what drink did you order?"" I know Jia Lat Liao. When the food came bak ku teh soup was not hot, satay was ok, ice holicks was diluted, hot holicks was ok, after about an hour I'm still waiting for my nasi briyani. Service speed is like 1/10. Maybe teething issues. But don't come hungry. You'll die of hunger before your food appears.

Update, briyani still mia. Kitchen didn't prepare. Cancelled my order, owner wanted to charge me 2 drinks and a scoop of ice cream. Half way keying in said he won't charge anything. Funny thing is walk past the kitchen the staff were all standing around doing nothing.$$the Indian in me is calling out blasphemy, but looks like a shiok leh$$disgustingly horrid place with effing' bad service with China waitresses who dont even know what they are serving. no crowd yet food took 20 mins to come with multiple wrong orders like almost 5times. had like 8 or maybe more waiters over there but no crowd yet all acting busy and no one bothers to give you the menu or to seat you either. 
took the wrong order and they didnt even bother to ask what was the correct order and just walked off leaving us with no order. really OMG. dont bother trying seriously. SERVICE SUCKS SHIT!$$Went there already, portion quite small and a bit ex.  Prata texture not as good as expected, still have dough not cooked enough.  Chilli crab sauce normal, salted egg prata normal.  Mushroom chicken prata dom not bad but price and taste compared to a mushroom chicken pie elsewhere, it lose out.  Ice cream and waffle was ok.  Overall speed for food poor.$$Is the model or blogger even genuine about her comments for the food served? Food is not served hot. Gave wrong order even when we ordered from tablet. Food is just average but pricey. Only good thing we had here was the french fries with cheese, 10 bucks for it though. 

Sad to say but really upset with my experience. Never gonna visit here again I guess.$$I went there today after seeing this post. 

NOT IMPRESSED. 

The soup with the garlic stick was good, but the soup was luke warm. 
The chilli wrap was not too bad, but serving was a tad small. 
We also had the mushroom chicken prata bomb, which, to be honest, you might hafta put a gun to my head before I pay for it again. 
We waited 15mins for it, and the fillings were Luke warm, and it tasted horrid. 
The lemon tea was nice, albeit a tad too sweet 

We left the place filling hungry after paying 35 dollars 

At least now I know not to trust everything I see on FB. :)$$Blogger is paid to write a positive review even how fcked up the food and service. Nothing beats the classic original Indian prata with spicy curry fish!$$It's an awesome place with great food and pleasant ambience. I can just sit there the whole day, eat, drink, meet friends and study. Love Big Street! More importantly, the cook always prepares special vegetarian dish for me. Very happy and grateful. 👍$$Went there for lunch, no comments about service. It was okay. But the food was terrible, sad to say. Might have been the indian in me, but the curry was like water(?) the chilli crab was more like ketchup and the pratas were just meh
Theres better prata for less than half the price outside$$Went on a week day lunch so no crowds at all.. Food was so so .. Honestly a little pricey for the average standard ..the briyani reminded me of my army days. Can go just for ambience .$$Disappointed with their service too! Went there sometime in July, walked in and was told fully booked for dinner & that was it. Service ended there & we just walked out. Won't go back anymore$$Wow, so many bad review abt tis cafe.

Or take a boat to Zamboanga from Manila.

What is it?
A vinta's sail is made up of vertical stripes of assorted colors that represent the colorful history of the peninsula's Muslim community. About a third of its population is made up of ethnic communities that give the region its unique flavor. These include the Tausugs, Samals, Yakans, Badjaos, and Subanens. Wait until you start hearing the people speak Chabacano – arguably the suavest-sounding dialect because of its heavy Spanish influence.

Fun Fact:
Vinta is also the name of a Moro dance performed to commemorate the migration of the Filipinos. Dancers imitate the movement of the vintas by balancing on the tops of poles.

Send it to us at manila@coconuts.co. No thanks to the expensive direct flights and mostly posh luxury resorts dotting its islands, Northern Palawan has remained inaccessible to most people. Which is sad, because there is more to Busuanga, Coron and El Nido than expensive island living. El…","Let me tell you one thing right away though this is a good article you can do it even cheaper than this. Return flights from Cebu or Manila to Puerto Princesa should cost no more than about php 4500. The van ride from Puerto to El Nido is NOT 850, it should cost about 500-600. I go to Palawan at least twice a year as my fiancée lives there...trust me the people here who have said you should stay away from exclusive and top resorts are right. Find the smaller out of the way places you'll pay much less. Even better get a local to book it..they get better rates always on everything and I mean EVERYTHING. For me I loved El Nido, but if you want boat trips, friendly locals, good food (but not essential electric) then go to Port Barton. I actually preferred Port Barton to El Nido because of its' laid back feel. El Nido can get very busy and full of tourists...it's nowhere near as bad as say Boracay but you don't really get the real feel of the Philippines there.$$i love the philippines not 4 the posh  resots but the true life with the poor & simple people$$Thank you

Because my girlfriend Heng Shu Chin been complaining that I am getting fatter because I am just eating the whole day long. Definitely need one of this to help me keep track of the amount of calories lost and etc from exercising and show it off to her as proof!!! Last but not least, my birthday is coming and this will be a perfect gift for myself to help me regain that IPPT gold!!$$Liked and shared. I am a gym junkies and food lovers. But sometimes i can go overboard when I am gyming and eating especially dessert. So hope this fitness tracker can help me count my workout routine to balance out my diet. Hope to win. Thank you$$Liked and shared! We need to keep track of our diet & calories count because we are always indulging in good food & desserts without having enough exercise. A Misfit Shine 2 will help us maintain our health by having a balanced diet/exercise regime and keep the sickness away 😊 Shem Leong$$I love to eat sweet as well as oily food, is far to maintain and develop body of a magazine cover hunk. But more importantly my main purpose is to help me get on track. Hope to own this amazing Misfit Shine 2, best fitness tracker to motivate me. The bonus point I love about Misfit Shine 2 is that I can opt to clip it to belts, shirts or even shoes!! Love it to bits!$$In order to strike a balance for a sweet tooth like me, I would want to win a Misfit Shine 2 to help me stay on track and be healthy. Moreover, Misfit Shine 2 doesn't sit on your wrist, but gets clipped on your clothing - It's so simple!$$Liked and shared
I now know things that I was oblivious to before. Ignorance was bliss. These desserts look so beautiful previously.  Now all I see are numbers when I look at them. Gotta have my Misfit Shine 2 so I could balance my in and outtake of calories so I can once again look at these desserts they way I used to.$$I'm probably the least fit around. My idea of exercise is walking my dogs or Pokemon-ing. Hahaha. Winning the Misfit watch would help keep tabs on my activities, and maybe make me more conscious on moving more.$$Liked and shared! Hopeful to win because I haven't found a fitness tracker that's versatile enough for different occasions until this. And I've been thinking of getting one to monitor my sleep due to my shift work. Plus it's gonna motivate me to move around more to increase my activity level since work is office based and I've been procrastinating on exercising.$$Liked and shared because I love to eat and I eat anything and everything as Long it fits my calorie intake daily. Thing is, I never knew the calorie count for Singapore food which amazes me that you guys are able to find out! The best thing is there are macro nutrients, aka, fat, carbs and proteins. That will definitely be better. I wanna win because I seldom have pretty clothes at the gym so let me stand out a little. 🙃🙂$$Liked and Shared! Being a new mother of a 3 month old, it's tough breastfeeding, keeping count of the calories you take in because yours always hungry and exercising! One of the toughest thing is ensuring I lose my pregnancy weight and yet be able to provide my son with the best and most nutritious breast milk! Getting a fitness tracker will definitely help me keep focused, motivated and of course keep track of my intake and exercise! I hope to win this fitness tracker to kick start my healthy pregnancy weight lose regime! :)$$I've always had issues with body image issues and I started out as a fat kid who was always bullied in school because I loved to snack and McDonald's was always my go to. Came February this year and I started being a control freak and limiting my food portion to 1 meal a day and sometimes I struggle to complete it because I was told I needed to lose weight and I wasn't good enough. Now I'm in in a better state and definitely happier and the fitness tracker will definitely aid me in achieving my fitness goals. After all its about being healthy and happy (:$$I'm super lazy at heading out for a walk and Jun Jie knows it best. With the fitness tracker, he can set a target for me to hit every week and motivate me to get out of my house and go for a walk or a run.$$Liked n shared
Since NS days, my weight is a healthy 60kg. Now my weight has ballooned to 80kg. I feel weak, sluggish and no confident. I hope that this tracker can be a reminder to lose weight be healthy. Walking is a simple and effective exercise.
Tan Bee Leng$$I should win as I don't have an activity tracker. I can only roughly track the calories I take daily via googling but I couldn't track the calories burnt. So scared only have in and no out. Wish dearly to own one activity tracker...
Liked and shared.$$Liked and shared. I hope to win Misfit fitness trackers so that I can work on my fitness. My fitness goal is to complete 2.4 km run within 12 mins, that is, 400 m within 2 mins. The fitness trackers will help me track my progress so that I can evaluate and plan my fitness routine.$$Liked and shared this post.I'm a food lover. Hence, is not so easy to maintain a good health. It will be wonderful if I could win Misfit Shine 2. This will help me to maintain my health and keep the doctor away.$$I'm hungry all the time, when I see this tracker on my wrist, I will know how far I came and I will feel guilty if I eat too much. This keeps me on track and helps to lose weight.$$The reason why I would like to win is this. Over the past few years, I've always been eating a lot, like really a lot. Being a 19 year old teenager, you would know how big of an appetite a person would have at this age, where it is a growing up stage, much food is needed. I'm constantly hungry, always upsizing my portion, always eating extras, always having that tea break & supper which is fattening like MCD? Or desserts??? that I probably shouldn't have. End result? Belly fats! Face became much rounder! Do I exercise? Nope, procrastination got the better of me, constantly finding excuses, rather eat & sleep and continue my sedentary lifestyle than to go out there to exercise. It was not until recently that I finally reflect on my actions, I calculated my BMI & I realized that I have to lose 5-8 kg in order to safely stay in the healthy range & not deviate towards the overweight category. For the past few weeks, I've been exercising & hitting the gym for 8 days consecutively now. Of course, my diet is still the biggest struggle to me because every where you go is just food, food and more food right so tell me, how to give up omg. But for the sake of my health, I've already plan this goal of mine, and I'll stick to it. I'll only have 3 meals each day, and stop upsizing my portion. If I feel the need to eat, I can have almonds in between meals, so as to fight the hunger pangs & besides almonds help in weight loss. I'll also hit the gym at least 3-4 times per week, because exercise paired with diet will help me in losing weight faster. 
Of course, diet plays the biggest part because you can exercise but you can also eat and you would need to exercise much longer in order to burn those calories you've consumed. Just as shown those desserts so much calories omg. 
I've been doing research here & there and of course action speaks louder than words. My goal is simple, to lose 5 kg before 2017. What the mind can conceive, it can achieve. :) so definitely, I hope that this fitness tool will further motivate me. Nothing is impossible. I'm possible :) cheers.$$I would want to win the Misfit Shine 2 to help me track my activities and be healthy. So that I can continue to enjoy in my indulgence and still be able to fit into my clothes.$$Liked and instantly shared!!!

I wanna win the fitness tracker because danggg the holidays has overtook my entire body. When bored I eat, go out with friends also eat, after working out go cafe eat again. I need my discipline back!!! Somemore next holiday gonna go vacay, need beach bod (kidding) 😂 but really, desperate times calls for desperate measures. Halpppp!! :'($$I want to win because I love desserts too much but cannot desert my weight loss goal; having my own Misfit Shine 2 will motivate me to transform into Miss Fit! 😊

I wan to celebrate the new year with my best friends at uss! Me and my bestie did our o lvls this year we are quite nervous of the results which will be released in jan 2017. I also have a bestie who went to ite and due to us seperated, we didnt have time to catch up with one another. We didnt even went out tgt this year due to our busy schedules and important exams. I really wan me and my besties to be able to go out and have fun nd relax and talk abt times where we were still tgt in the same school, same class, talking abt the stupid things which we did tgt etc. I feel that uss is just the right place for it. We nvr been to uss in a longgggggg time. I know that most probably on that day there will be alot of people and the waiting times for the rides will be very long. During that time we can catch up with life and ask one another abt the life we live in now. Like how was school, have any new crush which they like and can tease them abt their crush hehe.. So we will spend the time wisely talking to one another instead of using the phone while waiting for our turn on the rides. And some of the attractions dun even allow u to bring any of your belongings with you! Speaking of those attractions, i also can get to see my friends' reaction on the rollercoasters and i will most probably lmao during the whole ride haha(we sure love to make fun of one another)! XD
 Really hope that i can win the tickets as i wan to bring the girls back tgt to spend a day tgt and to forgot our worries and to escape reality temporarily. (Thanks for taking your time to read this.)$$It'd be wonderful if I am able to go to USS with a precious Friend of mine and share the countdown moment together :) it's been a long way we've both come along and having recently graduated from high school it will be great for us to end this year with each other's company and look back at 12 years of friendship!!$$USS is somewhere every tourist will wanna go. but wait, there's actually singaporeans that haven been there... and thats me! haha main reason is because i cant bear to spend the money bcuz i have fear of heights. time to conquer my fears...... wimmmeeee! <3 Yongda Tan$$Liked and shared this post!
Answer: I want to win tickets to New Year's Eve Party at Universal Studios Singapore™ because I want to experience and watch Tribute act performing the hits of Katy Perry, LED Street acts and performances and Pyrotechnics and multimedia shows. Since the Rides are open all night*, I should not miss this golden opportunity!!!$$I wish to win the tickets for celebrating my last moment of 2016 and my first moment of 2017 hanging out in USS and with my family which USS is not everyday open the park to midnight with all rides are open so I wish for a good memory with good place , good music , most fun day for my lifetime .......$$Always wanted to count down at somewhere unique and special! Cos i didnt get to countdown due to places being very crowded, but uss is the best way to countdown as able to enjoy rides and fireworks just like in a wonderland full of fun and laughter! A great way to start a new year right!😆$$Liked & Shared! 
I hope to win the NYE tickets so that I can celebrate 🎉 the 2017 with a big 💥 bang and do the countdown in USS!
Hope to spend the happy moments with my family and have a unforgettable night! 
KeKe Xiao Hui$$Because I wanna share this festive season insanity with my besties Kimberly Meagan Ray Yoe and See Toh Jia Xin and taking the battlestar all night long sounds like the best way to do it and it's my favorite ride of course.$$I've never been to a countdown before and I would like to make 2016 special. With all that happened in 2016, ending it in USS with my family would be the best ending that I could I ask for. It's a unique place and also I can only imagine the fun we will all have there!$$Liked & shared! Would love to win this as i want to celebrate with my bf! He is in the army and we have very very limited time. Most of the time when he book out, we spent it with our little girl so it would be great if we could win this so we could have like a day out just the two of us! Haha as parents, all the time are given to our child so hopefully, i'll get to win this so i could take this oopotunity to go on a 'date' w him haha$$I wish to win for my family since school close we only go window shopping nearby..If i win  i can bring them to USS as they been wanting to go.If i am lucky i win i only need to buy for my others kids.Hope i can be one of the lucky winners. join me too Zaidi Aiman Nana Ana Aizat Zaidi$$The Dad of my boy is the most special person in my life. He's the sole breadwinner of the family and always working hard to provide us with what the family wants. He not only will help out in household chores, he also spent time bonding with family. 

He is busy with work but often show his love and concern through little things he do everyday, he would make me honey water everyday before he goes to work and would also make sure the flask is full so that we would have enough water for the day.

I really appreciate everything he has done for the family and would like to surprise him with a trip to USS so he could have some fun and enjoy on the NYE!!$$Liked and shared post!
I would like to win this as it is really special to have a countdown party in USS, USS is also one of my favourite place and furthermore I love all the exciting rides there. Some rides are open all night long which means I can ride in the dark and it will definitely be extraordinary experience for me!
Thanks for this awesome giveaway!$$Liked and shared! 

I want to win this pair of tickets as my bf and i are really enthusiasts of amusement parks.  I hope to spend the day counting down with him in a place that both of us have never visited, together. It would definitely be a first and super memorable as we chat about our resolutions and enjoy the night lights at USS and ride together!
Please make my wish come true!!! ☆☆☆ We would of course post lots of pictures too!!! 
Thank you :)$$Hello Smart Local. I am someone that lives for such cheap (ok la USS very expensive for students like me) thrills. So getting the opportunity to get on rides at 1.30am would be the best thing that'll ever happen to me in 2016. Besides that, NYE was never celebrated in my whole 19 years of existence. I'm considered 'too young' by my parents and I'm not allowed to club or start my year with a bang bc not halal. Hence, my parents would actually support the idea of me celebrating New Years getting 'mabuk' (drunk/dizzy in Malay) on rollercoaster rides than on vodka or beer. So, this is my shot at winning them tickets. 😬$$Liked and shared! I wna win this coz i have been staying at home to countdown for the past few years.... I have no plans for this year's countdown as usual but really hope that I could celebrate the new year in USS this year!!! If not my last day of the year will be as boring as other years... :($$Liked and shared.
I really hope to win this so that I can bring my parents along, they have never been to USS nor hardly any other attractions cos of their working life from morning till night. I hope i will be able to make their new year more enjoyable and give them some time off to enjoy like they deserved. :')$$Liked and shared.

I hope to win the tickets as 2016 is really really a bad year. Hoping to get a spin on a roll coaster shout out to welcome 2017 (hoping it can be a better year)

Most importantly, to spend time and fun with loved ones on such an rare chance on their special opening hours :)$$Why I want to win? Are you kidding me??? It's like a childhood dream come true to stay overnight in a theme park!! Just hope I won't turn into Princess Fiona when the clock strikes 12! Haha!$$Keeping my fingers crossed that I will win as it will be a special unique night to spend new years eve at USS!!! Never had such a night experience before and definitely will be one to remember for years!! Liked and shared$$Liked and shared! Would like to win so I could end my 2016 on a bang by taking all the scream-worthy rides in USS! Besides, what is a better way to celebrate 2016 ending and 2017 starting than creating happy memories with the awesome shows and cute mascots?

is based on a TRUE STORY! Once there
was
a baby
girl named Marry. Her mother couldn't
take
all the
crying, so she decided it was time for her
to
go. She
buried her baby alive in her back yard.
After she
buried her she could still hear Marry
crying.
So she dug her back up and stabbed her
one
time in the arm,
and buried her again. Marry cried harder,
but a few
hours later it stopped. At exactly 12:42,
Marry died.
She bleed to death. Now her sprite
haunts
the
world. When your sleeping, she stabs
you in
the
arm and watches you bleed to death.
And
that's how she got the name ""Bloody
Marry"" this is the true story
of her. She wants everyone to feel her
pain
that she
felt. Apparently, if you re-post This isn't

see a little dead girl in your room tonight.
In the next
53 minuets someone will say I love you

I'm sorry
to 12 other comments you will have the

PSA over!$$To all TSL readers who have tried to participate in this flash sale - here's a recent update from Expedia's Facebook page for those who may have missed it. (https://www.facebook.com/Expedia.com.sg/)

------------------------
Expedia: ""We are sorry that this situation has happened. The problem occurred due to an unexpected glitch coupled with high traffic. It's not a situation we are happy about. 

We are sincerely sorry about this. We are working on a solution and will update you all again later this afternoon.""
------------------------

We've worked with Expedia before and we've used Expedia ourselves many times - so we believe they'll be able to come up with a good solution soon.

They are now doing their best to resolve this and they'll be posting an official statement later this afternoon.$$Give them a break. We are humans after all. This may be a lesson to be learn by their Marketing Department to always do a dummy test out before going live on such technical IT glitch. 

Hang in there @Expedia & TheSmartLocal.com hope that the matter resolves soon. Xoxo$$Hi all, we're sorry that the situation has happened. We are continuing to fix the problem and will update here once the sale is resumed.

Thanks for your patience and understanding.$$there is no mystery room to select?$$Tan Pamela Just FYI I'm going to try for this! For Sep 17/18 hah.$$will anyone who actually got the room please comment here, because i'm starting to believe that this was all just a ploy to get people to download the app lol.$$Its been 20 mins and yet still the same. Any updates on this issues?

Error Stated:
1) Sorry, your voucher cannot be applied to the booking
2) Sorry, but the average price per night doesnt meet the minimum requirement

Did you gave us the wrong Promo Code? Or just a sham to download Expedia?

You tell us to restart the app. But if i do, can you guarantee that i can get the promo?

Dear Expedia, I download your app just for the promo, and it turns out this way.... 😔$$What a low class way to encourage people to download expedia for a shot of try , no worries you've betray majority of your customer trust . Wont be even keeping the app anymore$$You guys have a lot to explain. Those who stayed up till late did not get it because of your error and had to restart the app over and over again, and now someone else who just logged in manage to get away with the sale.... This is one scam!

Now how should I explain to my wife that her 10 years anniversary gift was just a scam?

Goodbye Expedia! Hello again Booking.com & Agoda!$$It's a scam.. Been trying since 12.00am till 12.45am but the error code is still the same.. Called Expedia but they said the 50 rooms r taken, n they can only book the room for me without the promo code.. Just a gimmick to get users to
Download their app..$$Tried 1 hr 6 mins and called expedia as well! Guess it's a scam. #thesmartlocal has some explaining to do first thing in the morning you reach office!$$For your own sake, you had better distance yourself from Expedia. This fiasco that Expedia has generated has angered hundreds including myself. From their lies and horrendous management, to their mishandling of the relaunch, they have disappointed, disgusted, and infuriated all of us. Be smart, the locals aren't happy.$$Read the T&C, it says coupon value: $255 off hotel booking (“Discount”). One night is $255 before tax/surcharge but when proceed to payment and keyed in the code, it says  ""sorry, but the average price per night doesn't meet the minimum for this voucher"". It doesn't work, what a waste of time. Just to con you to download Expedia.$$BE CAREFUL everyone! Expedia shamelessly charged the room to my credit card, and at a room rate 50% percent higher than what every hotel booking website is selling at. The hotel Duty Manager has confirmed that the hotel has received my booking as complimentary stay, no reason why Expedia should charge me. Countless attempts to call & email Expedia over the last 4 days, got no help. My top 3 reasons for you to stop using Expedia are: (1) Their Marketing, IT, Call Centre don't speak to each other. Serious disintegration of a company. (2) Call Centre (for SG) is based in New Delhi. I spoke to 4 different Indian call centre agents, they have no idea about promo, cannot solve my problem. (3) Unstable technology. Guys, don't leave your holiday plans to a company like Expedia whose technology could screw you up. When you need customer service support, you need to deal with problem solvers, not programmed robots. Any problems out of their programmed capabilities, good luck, you're on your own! #BoycottExpedia$$Doesn't work at all. On Sunday - Mon stays it's ""unknown error"" and for other days the voucher code cannot be used because minimum average price is not met. It's a scam to get the app download numbers up.$$I can find the hotel,can proceed  all the way till they voucher code give me problem."" Amount is insufficient for the promn..blah blah"" . Is there anyone who has succeeded in claiming? Lol$$Not working at all. Average price per night doesn't meet the min requirement, and yet t&c state only can book one night per user..... :($$Either this is an elaborate, and counter effective, marketing scam, or the programmers are just plain stupid. Don't exactly know which is worse.$$Sorry smartlocal for spamming here. I know it's not your fault. Felt so guilty for complaining and defaming about the flashsale event! 😐😐😐$$ok.. so it not only me having this problem and it a scam. going to uninstall ...i guess i still stick to Hotels.com$$We are sorry that this situation has happened. The problem occurred due to an unexpected glitch coupled with high traffic. It's not a situation we are happy about. We are sincerely sorry about this.

A lot of interesting creatures can be spotted in Basura — octopuses, seahorses, tiny frogfishes, ghost pipefish, and tiny shrimps.

Visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a unique and exhilarating experience. Spectacular scenery, white sandy beaches and swaying palms combine with monuments and museums, world-class diving, swimming and sun basking make this a truly out-of-the-world experience. 

The Archipelago contains 362 volcanic islands scattered in the Bay of Bengal, with only 37 of these being inhabited. These lush green islands have colourful historical past, with strings of invasions by the French, Dutch, Japanese and British and wars between settlers and the native tribes. The Cellular Jail, where hundreds of Indian revolutionaries were imprisoned during the Indian freedom struggle, still stands tall. 

Descendents of these political prisoners and the local tribes of the area are the inhabitants of modern day Andaman and Nicobar. The tropical rain forests that loom close to the seashore are home to unique species of birds, and to tribes that still haven't learned to use fire.

Imagine QQ (chewy) glutinous rice balls oozing with Gula Melaka (palm sugar) and coated with fresh coconut shreds. Dyed into a natural green colour from the juice of pandan (screwpine) leaves.

Our friends The MeatMen show you how these gula melaka bombs will have you going for more once you have your first!

Full Ondeh ondeh recipe: http://themeatmen.sg/ondeh-ondeh/ ","This is Indonesia traditional dessert called ""klepon"".
Onde2 uses the same glutinous rice fluor, filling with mung bean paste and covered with sesame. Klepon and Onde2 are both traditional dessert of Indonesia$$I love this kuih onde onde or gula Melaka . I noticed in every Asian countries I went to there are similarities in food for example this also you can found in Vietnam but they call it differently so why must you argue where it's originated? We are all came from the same root/ region and sharing nearly the same type of food and even some have similarities in culture. Let's enjoy the food that bring people together.$$THANK YOU for saying the name right. And yes. it's a Malay kueh.$$this is basically same like tangyuen, but we use pandan leaves as flavoring and coated em with the coconut :3 Kim Yean$$Great. We're sharing a wonder recipe for everyone to enjoy and some arsehole trolls decided to come and claim this and that.  Only insecure people needs to claim this and that. The rest enjoys it the same regardless of origin.$$I'm so sick of ppl fighting about what is the real name of this kuih and the origin. Like seriously? Don't you guys have any other important issue to be think of?! Gosh. Just enjoy the food. Even in malaysia they are some ppl who call it onde2 and some call it gula melaka. But we never fight about what is the real name because we just enjoy th food. Get a life.$$This is in indonesia this name KLEPON$$Malaysia always claim something from Indonesia, can't you be more creative with your own thing? Thank you$$Every time I come back to Singapore, I have to go hunting for these.  The lil' neighbourhood Malay kueh stalls and that special, lovingly-homemade taste seems to be in short supply.$$Omg this is one of our fav!
Why everybody arguing abt this?
Asian singapore malay malaysia malay indonesia have very similar food history bcos we're all rojak! (What is not the same is country history) The malays here are javanese mix bawean mix bugis mix and we are all malay 😑$$Thank you for your recipe. Your recipe is highly reliable. May I ask if I would like to tweak that by using sweet potato, what's the sweet potato to
Flour ratio?$$Thumbs up for people who came here to see some yummy onde-onde/ondeh-ondeh or however ur country calls it as in the making process to entertain our saliva and not caring about it's origin just that it's an Asian delicacy$$Why are people fighting over who's dessert is this? At the end of the day, we all came from the same ""rumpun"" aka roots.. It's just food anyway. I'd be glad to know if I can find food/deserts that I love in various parts of the world..$$......yeah, I know it 's yummy....did that once in a  blue moon....using pandan leaves is the best ...nothing can beat the original flavour n aroma....Long live pandan leaf...!!!!...<3$$Gayle Lim is this the recipe you're planning to follow? I don't even eat this back home but I craving now hahahaha it's like tang yuan with sugar filling and coconut outside like that$$I don't care about the name, I just want to eat. If I say ondeonde and am met with blank stares, I just point to it and say ""that one"" and I still get to eat it. Who cares as long as it goes into the mouth? If it's different then I got to try something else, all the merrier.

Anyway this is a Singapore page so this food is known as onde-onde here. Just like we call roti prata here and not roti chennai. Peace.$$Actually as know this kuih is nyonya melaka. Those days wen m small only chinese aunties at my village sold during morning market. Talking about 45 years ago.$$I heard some people put a lil bit of salt in the coconut so the onde onde will be a lil salty outside n sweet inside.$$Actually gula anau is the best and the taste is slightly different from gula melaka..but gula melaka is commonly used for onde2..and that's why gula anau is slightly expensive than gula melaka bcause it is made from pokok anau..I love onde2 😋$$Good to steam the fresh coconut for 15-20 min with a pinch of salt. Helps coconut from spoiling too quickly.$$Jamil Adams omg I learnt how to make this in boarding! But Miss taught us with green food colouring 😂😂😂 and we all added too much sugar it exploded but it was so cool tho cause we got to make it into different shapes! You should've done it w us!$$That is javanese kueh from indonesia name is KLEPON or onde onde ( sumatra's call that kueh )$$I love this kueh....it's comfort food and reminds me of home... doesn't really matter who lays claim to it and honestly it should not really matter. Enjoy the Ondeh Ondeh..... irrespective where it came from or how it's made.$$This is kue traditional INDONESIA!!!!

Kalimpong has for long been in the shadows of its better known big brother – Darjeeling. Situated between the Deolo and Durbindra Hills at the foot of the mighty Himalayas, the landscape of this famous hill station in the state of West Bengal is a feast for one's eyes. 

51 km east of Darjeeling and at an altitude of 1250 metres, Kalimpong is a blaze of colour throughout the year thanks to the richness of its breathtaking flora. Apart from being a place to head to escape the heat of the plains, Kalimpong is the reminiscent of an English town, with faded, elegant buildings evocative of another era.

http://www.goabroad.com/articles/study-abroad/7-107-reasons-why-the-philippines-rockYou want to study abroad in Asia but can’t decide on a destination. So you pull up lists of programs on GoAbroad and browse through each listing, lookin...","I don't want to break the good vibes but this is just an observation. Some Pinoys act snobbish because they know English...lots of them students, professionals, celebrities...they are so proud that they can speak English that they almost ignored using their own languages...

We confined our native languages to farm life, poverty. But for 2nd languages like English and Tagalog (for non-Tagalogs) we use them when talking about pop, progress, industry, personal and social advancement.

We are killing the dignity and life of our own languages.$$Love my country 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 proud filipino!!$$All Filipino people are so nice!i!I ve been considering to move there because (look at the photo)$$Proud to be filipino$$Beautiful country friendly respectful people you are the best phillipines !!$$And the Pinoy men are hot$$Many Filipinos I know tell me I am the only Pinoy they know who speaks proudly and enthusiastically of the Philippines. They say, it is hot and humid; dirty and polluted; holdups, robberies, kidnapping, pickpockets, and corruption are pervasive everywhere. Why do you still speak proudly and enthusiastically of the Philippines? 

I respond, because of the Filipino people (proudly to be one of them!)! Because of our natural assets notably Vigan, rice terraces, Sagada, Mt. Ma(ga)yon, Palawan, Bohol, Cebu, CDO, also Baguio raisin bread, Albay's pinangat, Iriga's ginataang laing, Cebu's BBQ, just to name a few. And of course the positive changes such as Pinoys are now more health conscious (biking, running, hiking, and mountaineering) more concerned of the environment (recycling, trash clean-up, sanitation), and they are now intolerant of corruption. 

All these are evident in places where, if you don't know you're in the Philippines, you would think you're in nice European or US cities where it is safe to walk around, fun to window shop, definitely a gastronomical delightful to wine and dine, or experience a 4D-movie in a 4DX theater! Whoaa??? A 4DX theater in a Third World Country? There's not even one here in San Diego, CA! Positive and wonderful changes to the people and places compared to many decades ago. 

Why I speak proudly and enthusiastically of the Philippines? Do you have the time to listen?$$Yes, let's love our own naman! There are many positive things and blessings to be thankful for! Besides, as a matter of speech pattern--we truthfully can acknowledge 'those areas that need improvement=the negatives""...without sounding HOPELESS! There is always a ""way to solve problems/ improve the situation'--if only we sincerely put our minds and hearts to it!$$You only need one reason. I am in the Philippines right now and it's rainy season here in Palawan.....it's the people who are the most wonderful you could wish to meet ;) Right Aileen Turqueza?$$When I was still in the Philppines, I thought my country was bad enough to leave it behind. But then when I stayed and work here in the U.S for 5 yrs. I have a change of view and opinion about the Philippines and the U.S. You see I work here with one of the biggest retail store in America or maybe in whole world...I can't help myself to compare about the people here shopping and their behavior.  I've never seen such numbers of shoplifters here stealing everything from a 50 cent to 1000$ items. Some of the customers,if not all but Majority of them are so unruly and disrespectful, they open everything here even thightly sealed items and then just leave it behind in a mess. In short at the end of the day the store looked as if a twister have ran over it,total chaos. And this one makes me think that we behave more and we have more respect more than this people here. Saka sa maniwala kayo o sa hindi ang daming bobo dito! Moral lesson,don't you ever believed 100% in those hollywood movies that you watched about the way of living here, its not that true,it's totally different here in reality than in the movies. Some people here are too proud of themselves, they show too much superiority complex but when you closely look at it they were inferior. So people like me stays here for some reason but we don't forget who we are,100% Pinoy pa rin kami$$I am proud to be Filipino and I love my country, the beautiful Philippines!!!$$Many thanks Guys..hope you have a fabulous time in my beloved country--BEAUTIFUL PHILIPPINES...$$Beaches and forests not to be abused..$$Its more fun in the PHILIPPINES",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Zambales from Caloocan or Cubao (seven hours).

What is it?
In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

One of the sketches I have done in Hua Lien, all the beauty of Taiwan kept in my little sketchbook. So please let me be there to fill up the rest of my sketchbook with the wonderful experiences only KKday and TheSmartLocal.com can bring! <3$$Having been to Taiwan every year for the past few years, I hope to experience a different and more authentic Taiwan experience brought by KKDay by drifting along the valley of hualien mountains with Yao Zong~ 😊😊$$Taiwan is like our second home! Even spending a good 5 months living there, we hadn't seen enough of it yet and have always been wanting to return to Taiwan to create new memories and relive old memories with Wong Chui Yuen. Many thanks to @KKday and @TheSmartLocal.com for this amazing post and opportunity to travel bacm to Taiwan! Hadnt had the opportunity to experience all these new activities, so really hope we can be picked and be ready for Taiwan!! :D$$liked and shared!! Went to Taiwan 4 times!! Taiwan has been the best nature scenery and great hotsprings! Great food is everywhere! I hope to visit more of Taiwan places with Leow Anthony hubby which we have not visited yet!$$I've never been to Taiwan and would love to visit it for the street food, the sightseeing and especially to indulge in the local culture (and maybe get to brush up on my Hokkien hahaha!) All the pictures and videos being shared online on Taiwan have got me dreaming of it constantly..... Hopefully I'll be able to visit it soon! ☺️$$I've never been to Taiwan before but always wanted to. I would love to try paragliding and diving in Taiwan! And all my friends who have been there always tell me that the foods are super!! So, foods, here we come!$$Taiwan is my annual to-go country! But year in year out, it's time to experience Taiwan like I've never before! Didn't even know that one could do paragliding in Taiwan prior to this post!$$I am looking forward to catch the magnificient sunrise view from Hehuanshan mountain! I have heard that Taiwan has many nice hiking places with beautiful natural views which I hope to experience there also! What's more, its always a regret for me not going to wulai for the hotspring when I been there few years back.

Hope to win a trip for two to Taiwan with my BFF Mei Hong as it has been my checklist for years!

Liked & Shared! 😊$$Liked and shared! It's been more than 6 years since I last visited Taiwan and I really miss the hospitality from everybody! I want to stay in a guesthouse and fully immerse myself in the local culture, as well as visit all my Taiwanese friends! Really looking forward to visiting Taiwan again :)$$There's always something worth exploring in Taiwan. Would love to paraglide over the mountains and catch a panoramic view of Taiwan tgt with my buddy Fiona Lam$$I am looking forward to visiting Alishan at Taiwan as it is one of the mountain in Taiwan whereby I could experience the nice scenery especially the sunrise moment, believe it would definitely be an eye opening with such great view!  I hope to be given a chance to fly there so that I could take valuable photos and share my experience with my love one and friends too!

Liked and shared!!! :)$$Haven't been to Taiwan before, but I have some Taiwanese friends that I have made during my internship in poly that I would like to visit after hearing how great Taiwan is from them! Moreover, there is the upcoming Sundown Marathon that is going to be held in Taiwan for the first time, and I would like to bring someone over with me who is also keen on doing the marathon there!

In addition, instead of just travelling to mainstream places where everybody frequents, I like to venture off to the unbeaten track and explore new things, just like the experiences mentioned in this guide!

Lastly, I hope to win this trip for 2 to Taiwan!$$Went to Taiwan for a few times but never have a chance to explore the counties & city outside Taipei city. For my next trip to Taiwan, I am looking forward to explore Taiwan's local culture from town to town by taking the Taiwan slow train.  This is one of the best way to understand the history & culture of each town as well as enjoying he beautiful scenery along the way! Best of all, I can have a chance to try out many delicacies & street food in different towns, as well as the must try platform bento from vendors at the train station!
Liked And Shared Awesome Giveaway! 
Hope to win this to visit Taiwan again with my husband!$$I just got back from Taiwan last month and didn't manage to tick any activities off this list!! I would love to go for the rafting and night shrimping session if I had the chance to!!$$My BFF and I have never been to any overseas trips together and we really hope that the organiser would grant us this opportunity to explore the charm of Taiwan. The major attractions of Taiwan to both us are their well-reserved natural tourist spots and the Taiwanese's people friendliness that can be seen in TV. We really really hope to feel Taiwan and best of luck to both of us so that this small little wish would be granted!! 2016 is the 'Time for Taiwan!!!! Florence Chong Huey Lin .😘$$I've never been to Taiwan before cos I don't trust my own standard of Chinese to survive there on my own... so winning the ticket means I can bring someone along (more proficient in Chinese) with me to survive the trip. And I wanna try paragliding! I've not had a chance to try it but it's something I'd wanted to try, cos it looks like something doable for a chicken-hearted me. 😁$$I've only been to Taipei once briefly and fell in love with the warmth and hospitality of the people there. However, I would really love to bring Victor Neo to Taiwan for his grad trip as he has never been, and it would be super duper awesome to discover the cool local stuff we can do in Taiwan with TSL and KKday's great recommendations. What I would really look forward to doing are the adventure sports such as rafting down Hualien mountain and also paragliding across the sky! *v*$$Hoping to win this trip as a gift to my significant other's parents! They loved everything about Taiwan on their last trip here 2 years ago. Every time Taiwan is mentioned, they can't stop reminiscing about how good the night market food is in Taiwan.

Thus, the activity I'm looking forward to the most for them is definitely exploring the numerous night markets across Taiwan! Having all the best eats in one place & perhaps even a guide to explain the best eats like what KKday offers would definitely make any trip to Taiwan even more memorable :)$$Liked and shared! I will love to try the paragliding in taiwan! Always know taiwan as a foodie heaven, didn't know that there's so much things to do over there. ❤️❤️❤️✈️✈️✈️🙆🙆🙆😍😍😍$$I've been to taiwan but never had i know that taiwan had such amazing activities. If i could, i would definitely want to try all the listed activities, if not , the top 3 would be the Paragliding, Hualian and Sunrise tour! However, if i'm only given a choice, I would definitely go for the sunrise tour! I have always wanted to try trekking but never have the chance to. Really hope to witness this magnificent view of taiwan. I believe both Alvin Tan and I would be wow-ed by it! :)$$I would love to go whale and dolphin watching in Taiwan! I have a huge love for the people of Taiwan, their hospitality and culture, and most of all...... Their food! Whale and dolphin watching added to all that would make it the perfect trip and I really hope to be given the chance to revisit Taiwan :) thanks for this giveaway!$$I just came back from a solo trip to Taiwan recently and I left my heart there, craving to continue my exploration of this friendly country! There's simply too much to do, especially looking forward to the paragliding if I get the chance (:$$Been to Taiwan many times and only explored Taipei the bustling city always! Only gone there for eating and shopping, never been there to try out activities like a local!!

How to Get There:
Take a boat from Cebu to Siquijor.

What is it?
The island is famous for its virgin beaches and secret swimming spots. But the thing about Siquijor that probably resonates the most is its reputation for magic and sorcery. During Good Friday, the island is supposedly the go-to place of witchdoctors from all over the country who are looking to recharge their amulets.

Fun Fact:
Local healers can concoct potions made from oils and herbs for visitors to take home. A scented lana (coconut oil-based ointment) made by a healer is believed to relieve one of stomach aches and body pains.

What is it?
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact:
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

A story unfolds as you go deeper during a typical dive at a Puerto Princesa site. Ten feet from the surface, coral walls and slopes begin to form. Between 40 to 60 feet and you’ll see schooling fish, sea turtles, rays, camouflaged marine animals and brightly colored invertebrates. Beyond a hundred feet, giant fan corals dance to the rhythm of the slow-moving current.

Fun Fact:
Located at a section of the Philippines that’s farthest from the Pacific Ocean, Puerto Princesa and the rest of Palawan are seldom on the path of tropical storms.

The bridge looks the same, and there is water on both sides of where they are sitting so it seems to be the east side.  The large bridge behind them and the bridge that he crosses are the same as on this island.

That being said I definitely do not condone their behavior, in fact I hope Ms Thelma wins. This is one of those horrific pieces of news that makes you question, where is humanity.

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one 😂😂 damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london 😍😍 my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it 😂$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin – Singapore’s 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy! It's the most unforgettable dining moment.$$There's this place where you pick what food you want, and it get delivered to you like a speed train on a conveyor belt after the chef has finished your order.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back.

We will check that. Thank you!$$hi,, where do we see the itineraries of other participants? do you have a page where all entries can be viewed and their number of likes? thank you$$Hello Mark, I was also wondering how you had  3 thousand votes within the first five days of the contest when the 2nd place person at that time had maybe 600???  Your 1rst place rank has seemed strange to me from the outset.  page views don't necessarily equal a vote, as anytime a friend posts your itenerary to their facebook page you get a point and I have a LOT of friends, So,please do not attack or question me, unless you want to be investigated yourself.  I also think offering to ""give"" something to the KTO is known as a bribe and might, accoring to most contest rules disqualify you.  My motivation is not self interest, as yours seems to be, but a motivation for my wife and my 2 kids to see their grandparents and extended family in Korea.$$We really understand that everyone is passionate about this contest and can appreciate your concern, but please be assured that scores will be tallied in a fair, unbiased manner. (That's what we were trying to convey with our previous message.^^)

As far as gifts go, the biggest gift you can give us is your love for Korea and your kind postings on our facebook. ^^ We really hope that this contest is something that everyone can enjoy, so that we can continue to offer you special opportunities like this in future. Thank you all so much!$$@KTO: whre can we view the full listings of participants and votes? its disheartening to join and see that this (above msgs) is already happening.... i just posted my pic and i feel i dont have a chance anymore,,$$Thanks KTO!  I appreciate your unbiased mind and support. Our family truly loves Korea and our main interest is to spark interest in Korea to our friends and family and their friends and hopefully they will help us win so we can take our kids to see their grandparents:)  I wish all of the contestants luck, it is not over until December 10th, so keep trying and we will also keep trying! ;)  Go Korea!

what is KTO??$$@Yan Amore Pioggia: We are the  KTO (official Korea Tourism Organization). ^^ Have you seen our website? Please check it out when you have time: www.visitkorea.or.kr.$$how on god's green earth are people confusing KTO with KBS? they are two totally different entities in two totally different industries and do totally different things! they only share one word in common: korean. LOL anyway, KTO is a great ambassador for korea...keep it strong! :-)$$Oops!! Someone mix up KTO with KBS??? No no no!! Please be rational when we need to tell what we think and what we need to the world. Please do not bombard the parties which didn't involve in this disgraceful issue! 

BTW, KTO, I really like Korea but this issue is a true let down...I can accept the boycott of JYJ in other issues (like QTV issue, the members are banned from the music programme, etc...) however an honorary ambrassador on behalf one government are banned from the show? No way - it really looks ridiculous to international world, and it seems to us that: even government can be brought off or need to kneel down in front of the pressure from private sector.$$I love Korea and I like KTO because you are doing a great job to spread Korean love everywhere. But honestly, Korea is lossing respect and love because of the JYJ incident with KBS and Jeju. I think fans just want to raise attention from everywhere so I just posted on your wall ^^. I hope that you wont misunderstand JYJ fans just because of those comments. And it would be great if the problem is solved fairly and the bad ppl are punished$$JYJ incident has been an example of how cruel part of entertainment world and it possibly can happen in other country as well with other actress/or.  We totally understand, the scope of KTO is much wider - it's more than just entertainment world, it's all bout Korea country, the  people and their habits, unique culture, yummy culinary world, and promote the entertainment world as well, as part of the korean wave program.. keep spreading Korea's world to us, i love to hear the updates... btw, like the profpict,been to Carribean bay and Ocean world last year, those are the two of my fave place to challenge my adrenalin$$Thanks for your understanding everyone! It would be nice if the KTO had a little more power when it comes to the entertainment industry, so that we could give our fans a stronger voice. Maybe someday?$$KTO represents a wider scope (Kculture, Kentertainment, etc) but it would be very appreciated if it also has a strong voice. I hope your government will take note that Korea is being promoted heavily through its entertainment industry. And with what happened to JYJ (who was heavily promoting Jeju) , i don't think it a presents a good image of Korea, that it can just drop someone off at a very short unofficial notice. I still hope that this will be rectified asap.$$I like Spaland in Busan...totally amazing!! Really a good treatment after crazily jumping and crying in JYJ Busan Concert :-) Thinking getting back to Busan by end of this year to see the Maple, and of course to visit Spaland again (HEART) 

@KTO Thanks for your feedback as at least we know the messages are well delivered. It would be great if you can gather the comments and pass to the related government officials. And again, thanks for your efforts in this issue too...your end is so innocent!!!!

He began to build the temple complex in 1921. There are several halls, temples and pavilions including the Three Saints Hall, the Bronze Pavilion that excludes women and girls, the Archives Hall, the Yue Hing Shrine that has a Buddha, a Confucian hall for the worship of Confucius, and a colorful garden called the Good Wish Garden.

Let’s find out why they are said like this.
Maybe one of reasons is using natural material cosmetics in a daily life.

Tsubaki oil (camellia-seed oil) used since 7th century, is effective in moisturizing and cutting off ultraviolet rays. Not only women use, sumo wrestlers use it to tie up their hair, and kabuki actors use it as their make-up base. 
Azuki bean has been used as skincare among upper class ladies from the ancient time. It accelerates blood flow, therefore it is good for getting rid of pimples and smoothing your skin. 
Komenuka (rice bran) is highly praised for its effect on beautifying skin. Its vitamins remove spots and works for anti-aging. 

For your information, cosmetics will be one of the tax-free products since this October.

If you can't use Google Maps to save your ass, Downtown Line 2 opening this December is just what you need. Here're 20 previously ulu places you can now explore with ease!

Thanks to Land Transport Authority – We Keep Your World Moving, we can now say goodbye to tiresome walks under the hot sun! 

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/downtown-lineWith Downtown Line 2 opening this December, here are 20 previously obscure places you can now explore with ease!","Hi. Please take your photo which shows hikers going through a tunnel down. You give the impression that the tunnel is part of a hiking trail. It is not! This is a biking trail and NOT open to hikers (per NPark's directives). Bikes come down the tunnels in speeds in excess of 30km/h and will not be able to take evasive action if there is a hiker there. Showing this photo gives the impression that hikers can use this part of the trial and this can potentially cause injuries to both hiker and biker.$$The pictures taken at the foot of the tunnel under the dairy farm trail section is not part of the ""Wallace trail"". This is part of the bukit timah mountain biking trail. Hiking is illegal and dangerous on all mountain biking trails. 

Posing at the foot of the tunnel seems picturesque. But please note that bikers will come down this slope from your back at high speeds. The transition from light to dark (in the tunnel) will make it difficult for bikers to see anybody standing in the middle of the trail.$$Nice, except that the ""tunnel"" is part of a mountain bike only trail. Bikers will be zooming downhill through that tunnel, not expecting walkers to be on the trail.$$I guess if you were on a bicycle or motorbike for years, you would have been to most of these places.  Regarding MTB trails, I give up, groups and clubs of people playing radio control cars in them. Making movies, standing in the middle of the trail chatting. Here's some advice: don't ever block a trail, if you need to stop or chat, move to the side or stay off the trail.  Get on a bike and go trail riding, you will understand what we mean.$$https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nparks.gov.sg%2F~%2Fmedia%2Fnparks-real-content%2Flearning%2Flearning-journeys%2Fguided-walks%2Fdiy-guided-walks%2Fancient-forest%2Fdiy-trail-guide.pdf%3Fla%3Den&h=xAQEkvCX9

You may not want to introduce your readers to somewhere which they will risk  getting themselves injured. As what some have already replied below, that section in your photo IS a mountain biking trail.

Oh and this can be a great birthday present for you! 😙$$This Valentine's Day I will be flying off as it is part of my job. :( although we will be miles, even time zones apart, we will definitely Skype each other and celebrate Valentine's. It doesn't always need to be a grand occasion. As long as i get to see him or be with him, I'm happy. He's a best friend I can't live without and he pulled me through my darkest times. I love him always.$$When the clock strikes 12 tonight (16/01/16), it'd mean yet another milestone in our relationship - a decade. Happy 10th anniversary my love Min Yi Chua! Thank you for being the best boyfriend I can ever wish for, and also my best friend at the same time, for the past 10 years. (Yes, we are childhood lovers since secondary school😄)
I won't say our relationship is a smooth-sailing one, but I am glad we've survived a decade! Cheers to more decades to come! This coming vday will be our 10th vday tgt. It's definitely sth worth celebrating as this day didn't come easy. However, we aren't planning to go fancy restaurant or what not as we're saving up for our wedding day on 16/10/16. Rather, it'd be more of a simple twosome time at my house where I will cook his favourite dishes. Everyday is like vday when I'm with him <3
Hope to get this bracelet to mark this special day for us :)$$Koon Lim this valentine day will be such a special one because i m expecting our baby nuumber 1 and   we get to celebrate with little boy in my tummy  . This year we wont be able to book any restaurant because i know you know my cravings are different all times so on that day we will be like usual couple , dating and shopping for baby stuff and also waiting for the unusual cravings on that day and dine in any restaurant or hawker when food craving hit. What's more we dont celebrate our love just on valentine day . We celebrate almost everyday even when we fight. our love sparks even when conflicts start . And yes other than dating and eating and shopping, we also plan to have a heart to heart session at the beach when we can enjoy the breeze and also the night views !  Hope to take this opportunity to win and surprise 😆$$During Valentine's day, I would like to do something meaningful with my boyfriend by doing volunteer work to visit those that is less fortunate and spread the love to them. Everyday is a special day as long as i can spend time with him, we do not need to show our love to each other more especially on days like Valentine's day because we love each other so much that we do not know what is loving more. So we decide to share our over-flowing love by helping those that are less fortunate. As much as i want to ask my boyfriend to participate this contest with me to increase the chance of winning, but i decided not to in order to surprise him if i win the contest by sharing our love experience.$$Zhi Wei Lim this valentine's day I'll be the slave driver and ordering you to run errands (which I have not thought of) for our wedding in March 😂😂$$Well, my BF, currently my husband will be my travel mate this coming Valentine's day as we are going away for our honeymoon in Europe!

Haven't been spending much time ever since long distance started for us, so this is a chance to spend a lot of time tgt!$$Thie valentine i plan to bring my wife out for a walk and a day of dating. no fancy restaurant being booked at the moment because her strange cravings change everyday so i wont know what will she want to eat on that day . So we will be shopping till she hungry and bring her to eat whatever food she is craving for. and of course not to make her too tiring on her feet as she is pregnant , I will bring her to watch movie to relax her back as well as her feet. To us everyday is valentine day so on this day it wont be that special because in my heart she already taken the special place which words can't describe !$$Maybe snuggle and have a heart-to-talk chat. We're comfortable just like that. Or maybe cook / bake together. I'll be the helper, like usual, and he'll be my personal chef. But even doing nothing is fine. I just want to spend it with him. I want to stay by his side. Always.$$Just be like what we've been for the past 13 years. Or is it 12 years? We've never done couple bracelets before and we don't like couple outfits.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/rabbit-hqAnimal lovers, get a load of this. Have you ever seen, let alone cuddled a bunny the size of a corgy? Well, at Singapore's only Rabbit HQ, now you can!","Abigail Foo BRING DANDY AND JULIUS AND CUDDLE THAT FRENCH LOP$$Please do not buy rabbits on impulse because they are VERY FRAGILE. They are small, but does not mean they are ""easier"" to take care. 

If you do not intend to let your rabbit free roam or at least have a 3m by 3m playpen to house it, please do buy rabbits. They are indoor animals, not to be kept along the corridor to be exposed to rain and shine. 

They are domesticated. So do not bring them out like how you bring out dogs. They get stressed up very easily and may die from it. Once they stop eating or drinking for 24hours, they may die from gut stasis, which is VERY common for rabbits. 

Please, do not get any animals to teach yourself or your family member on being ""responsible"". No lives is too insignificant to be cherished for.$$While I can see that this is an advertorial post 'brought to you by Rabbit Headquarters', it seems like only one surface was scratched by this article. What it lacks to provide a wholesome view, is the position of animal welfare groups such as SPCA Singapore, House Rabbit Society Singapore (HRSS) and Bunny Wonderland that actually rescued rabbits that were bought by petshop patrons and then surrendered. Some of them were severely neglected because they were bought as toys and not as living things. These rescues nurse them back to health and help them to find a new home, without monetary gain. Hopefully Singapore readers will realize there is always 2 sides to a coin and make a more educational decision to do what is right. And until there is no rabbit to be adopted in these shelters, then I will feel it is right to buy a rabbit produced just for you by petshops.$$I think you need to publish about rabbit SHELTERS rather than a wannabe HQ that does not save abandoned rabbits. Money for you is one thing, doing the right thing is another.$$Please consider adopting a pet bunny from House Rabbit Society Singapore (HRSS) or Bunny Wonderland instead. When you adopt, you save TWO LIVES. 🐰🐰$$Dont just buy because its cute and abandon them when you are sick of it or when the rabbit is old.

What is it like? 
Water is so central to Angono life that during the town's yearly festival, fishermen hang their catch near the image of the town's patron saint. Of course, St. Clement is also the patron saint of fishermen. Afterwards, the image, the fish and the fishermen get on a large boat and parade down the Angono River.

Angono is also known for its higantes — colorful oversized paper-mache effigies.

Until now, it was necessary to perform the tax-free procedure each time for every one store visited. But in the new system, tax-free procedure can be combined with the goods purchased in multiple stores, such as within shopping streets.

Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5, 001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10, 001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district. 

It would be a pleasure to introduce Okayama City as the first shopping spot in Japan where you will have this new Tax-free system benefit.
At the tax-free stores in Omotemachi Shopping Street and Romantic-dori Shopping Street, you may purchase Japanese traditional sweets, tea utensils or Japanese tea, and then operating procedure tax refund at the tax-free counter of Tenmaya department store. You will be able to get the benefit and also you may enjoy authentic Japanese Tea in your home country.

Okayama is absolutely nice place to visit, where you can enjoy not only shopping but other beautiful attractions as well.

What is it like? 
Baguio City is a city on the Cordillera Central mountain range, which is 1,600 meters above sea level. The place is lined with pine trees, and has a subtropical highland climate with temperatures going down as low as nine degrees Celcius during the cool months of December, January and February. ""The Summer Capital of the Philippines"" can get a little crowded during March, April and May, when people from other cities come for a visit to escape the urban heat. 

Fun Fact: 
Tam-Awan was built to showcase a model village of authentic Ifugao huts, which are expertly constructed without the use of nails. The compact huts are elevated to shoulder level by four sturdy wooden posts. Tam-Awan is a popular tourist site in Baguio City not only for its huts, but also for its art galleries, annual art exhibits, workshops and cultural performances.

I am a single mom raising two boys alone. 2017 will be the start of our new lives..

Liked and shared #startAFRESH$$My craziest new year resolution for 2017 is to finally be able to cycle confidentally. This might not seem crazy for others but it is for me. Went to ECP when i was 16 and something happened, something bad. Hoping to overcome my fear and be able to cycle with my mum as she is a avid cyclist :)$$""Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's Maybelline."" - #word really. I don't believe in being born with beauty; I guess you can be born with pretty good features (or not), but beautiful is really a long journey of working hard to refine oneself not just on the inside, but outside as well. 

This year, as I am going to be a 2017 bride, my craziest new year resolution would be to STAY OFF SWEET FOODS. Which is almost impossible because if you looked at my FB and Instagram, you'd know just how integral food is in my life. Not just for survival, nope, it's more than that. It's sustenance for my fun-loving soul 😂😂😂 But since I need to look good for my upcoming wedding and pre-wedding photoshoot, I have to cut down on desserts for good skin and some weight loss. So please be kind and support me in my journey - good makeup is always welcomed! 😉🎉💕 #startAfresh$$My craziest new year resolution is to finally pluck up the courage and determination to learn martial arts! This would open doors to so many new opportunities like travelling independently (safety!), being more active and healthy and finally, meeting new people in Uni! ✈️💪🏻👭👬👫 Will definitely be a tough one to follow through but I'm resolute that I can! And of course, looking fab when I'm not trying to kick ass will be awesome too!$$Craziest new year resolution is to be kinder and better to myself. I spend non working hours for my kids and with my kids, even when i am on leave its all for them , never for myself. This year i will be a bit selfish and create more time for myself, a leaner me, a fitter me and a healthier me!$$My craziest resolution is to do good and pay it forward at least once every month! Be it a kind deed, donate to charity and help someone in need! Got to be beautiful not just outside, but inside too right?

I hate make-up for nuts after having done a photoshoot make-up cause everything felt so heavy on my skin and I could feel my pores suffocating!

 Cebu City, Visayas

How to Get There:
Fly to Cebu from Manila, Clark or any of the key cities in the country. There are also scheduled flights from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita in Japan and Incheon, South Korea.

Buses bound for Cebu leave from Dumaguete, Oriental Negros and Bacolod, Negros Occidental every hour.

It is also possible to take your car here via a Roll On-Roll Off (RORO) ferry. 

What is it?
Fiestas are the best parties. Even if they're celebrated in honor of saints, the costumes, street dancing, music and merrymaking are always great!

Fun Fact:
Three of the biggest fiestas in the Visayas are held each year in January in honor of Sto. Niño (Child Jesus) -- Sinulog in Cebu, Dinagyang in Iloilo and Ati-atihan in Aklan.

Additionally, the Asahikawa Heiwa-dori Shopping Street in Asahikawa City, Hokkaido, introduced the new tax-free system on June 1, 2015. 
Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5,001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10,001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district.

For example, buy some Japanese teas, a kimono and anything else you fancy on the shopping street, and when you have finished shopping, just go to the tax refund counter in Seibu Department Store. Enjoy shopping at bargain prices, and take a little taste of Japan back home with you.

Asahikawa City has many other attractions besides shopping, and also a great destination for travelling. Please come and visit!

She lists 5 reasons why Marine Parade GRC voters should vote for The Workers' Party. (Okay she gotta work on her listicle writing skills lol)

http://mustsharenews.com/sylvia-lim-goes-all-buzzfeed/ ","In my opinion, 5 reasons not to vote for WP as follows:
1. Wayang Party (WP) - make a lot of noise at rally but keep quiet in Parliament
2. Flip flop like roti prata, first, your party - Gerald complained about too much foreigners 4 years ago. Now he complained about the u-turn on immigrant policy which is hurting business ?? So what do u all want? Complain everyone can but where is your proposed solution 3? 
3. Like to launch personal attacks on PAP candidates - called LKY a liar and Shanmugan a barking dog - is this ur so called a first world parliament ??
4. Greed for Power - have not shown us results in terms of managing a GRC well yet going after a few more GRCs n SMCs. 
5. Growing Arrogance - see themselves as the best of the best n disregard the other opposition parties - if you can't respect others how do u expect others to respect you$$1. So if we vote for WP, there will be less senseless change? Can the WP stop it?

2. Three bad policies? There's an entire book on his achievements. Go google it.

3. People don't understand or know how difficult it is to persuade anyone to come forward and be a Minister. Having to balance conflicting demands from all sectors of society is an impossible and thankless task. Whoever becomes a Minister will always suffer brickbats because no policy can satisfy everyone. Ask yourself, how many people are willing to put themselves in the firing line knowing they can never satisfy anyone, and they will be flamed no matter what they do. Yes, Chuan-Jin can still contribute in other ways, but how many are willing and able to be a Minister? It is so damn hard lah, please.

4. Accomplished team? I looked up Bernard Chen and he has only worked for only less than one year. And you expect me to believe he can run a town council?? YJJ and the rest have only started to work the ground this year. Previously, only saw YJJ in Joo Chiat and nowhere else. I don't think that's as accomplished as the rest of the MPs who have been here for more than one term.

5. Agree, and national interest to some like me means Vote PAP to make the Opposition work harder!$$WP stop talking nonsense lah... I am not going to vote for you.. my vote goes to PAP.$$So what solutions do u have for the above huh???$$OK....  What actually ARE the 5 reasons ?$$Since when this site became political?

Visiting Rod Fai is very different experience from those just used to going to Chatuchak. It has FASHION, FOOD and BARS all lined up next to each other. But even this market is different from the old Rod Fai Market.

Vinta is also the name of a Moro dance performed to commemorate the migration of the Filipinos. Dancers imitate the movement of the vintas by balancing on the tops of poles.

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what’s around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to development in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into 
knowing existence.$$Dt 22-01-2016   Hello Friends & Family's   🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳   🌞🌞🌞 !!!

The community of 5 families we stopped at had access to a fresh water spring but would not take any form of currency.

Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.


Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name “Bantayan sa Hari” (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to “Bantayan,” the name it's known as today.

The f1.8-2.8 aperture is THE key feature that will help in my food photography to achieve that bokeh effect our iPhone cameras cannot do, when Kevin and I explore the many cafes all over Singapore!😊 He has been saying we should get a DSLR to take better shots of our food (because our cameras eat first😋), but who wants to lug a bulky and heavy DSLR camera around on dates?!🙄 This SONY Cyber-shot camera is the perfect solution🤗 And, SONY cameras have come a long way! My first digital camera was from SONY- I definitely share an affinity with and trust this brand!😁$$Listing only one key function of SONY's Cyber-shot™ DSC-RX100M4 doesn't do justice to this pocket size friendly camera! Known for its superspeed potential, it's packed with impressive features like an F1.8-2.8 aperture, a ZEISS® Vario-Sonnar T* 24-70mm lens, and shutter speeds of up to 1/32,000 of a second, it takes DSLR quality pictures without the bulk! Indeed an award-winning camera and so apt for girls like me who don't carry a big bag around 👍🏼🙆🏻 Being in this advanced technology century, where everyone is looking for WIFI on the go, having a built in WIFI in this beauty is a plus! Because it allows me to post any photos easily on the go onto my Instagram without having to transfer the photos to a desktop/laptop. How not to love this compact beauty? 😍 I hope I can win this and start posting more Instagram worthy photos😉 Thank you TSL!$$Love the big aperture to F/1.8. Make this camera perfect for food photography. The lens and also the shutter speed of 1/32,000 really make this camera a powerful little treasure to capture the precious moments! 

Just simply love love love it!$$Liked and shared.

RX100M4 has a F1.8-2.8 lens which make my photo Bokeh-licious (creating a very shallow depth of field), also the high ISO allow me to take supreme night shot with low noise. The high shutter speed of 1/32000sec allows me to capture sharp images when performing high speed photography. I believe this camera will help me in photography as I am love bokeh photography and night shot.$$The low aperture available with the Cybershot DSC-RX100M4 will allow me to take amazing pictures of food that has different layers, which happens that most of them are my favourites; think bingsoo, pancakes, cakes and waffles. Yay for desserts, will the cybershot camera, I can nail these with a great depth of field behind the food photograph. Cheers to instaworthy food pics. Thanks the smart local 🙌🏻$$SONY's Cyber-shot™ DSC-RX100M4 has so many impressive features and i especially love the shutter speeds of up to 1/32,000 of a second, perfect for capturing high quality pictures even when moving around! This camera is light and compact enough that i can easily bring it with me on my backpacking trips. :)$$As a hipster cafes lover, I've encounter some difficulties in taking nice food pictures especially lighting issues. With DSC-RX100M4, I'm more ready to upload into Instagram since the one-inch sensor in the lightweight and nifty camera is good for snapping photos in low light environment. And also, the weight and photo quality blew my mind. What's more could i ask.

The wifi sharing functions is useful for cafes lovers because I'm able to share all the on the table projects/Flat lay photos on social media such as Instagram.$$Liked and shared! I love compact the slim SONY's Cyber-shot™ DSC-RX100M4 is. That not only makes it easy and convenient to carry around for daily uses and at the same time we don’t have to compromise on the quality of the shots taken unlike other compact cameras. DSLR quality photos can be easily produced with this camera, just how great is that? Another favourite would be the 180 degree tilting LCD screen with that, there’ll never be blurry & pixelated selfies! Yay. Love how Sony manages to squeeze such amazing features and functions into such a small frame. :) Jian Sheng TheSmartLocal.com Sony Mobile SG Sony Mobile$$Liked and shared☺️☺️☺️ I've always faced difficulties in taking nice food pictures because of lighting issues and now I no longer enjoy taking pictures of food bec all the pictures just don't turn out nice. However, the one-inch sensor in the light and nifty camera is the best for capturing photos in low light, helping me to combat dimly-lit restaurants or cafes. Such a compact and light camera sounds like my best pal, simply just pop it into my bag and I'm ready to head out with my girlfriends. The wifi is definitely something to look out for because I'll then be able to share pictures on social media with my friends almost instantaneously❤️❤️❤️ I've been looking out for a compact and light camera without compromising all the features and I've seemed to found the perfect one! Hope to win this so that I can this new toy outfit some fun 💯💯💯💯💯💕$$I love its wireless capability and  compact size! I'm personally not a professional photographer, but I definitely love snapping candid photos on the go! (these are the best photos, aren't they!! 😁) The high shutter speed is thus really handy for a noob like me! 🤗 Woohoo!$$I love its 1 inch sensor which will help me capture much better quality photograph at night than using a mobole phone as i absolutely like to take photographs of the countless scenic view in the night. Furthermore, these 1-inch sensor that aids the high speed photography will definitely help me in sports photography which is also one of my greatest interest$$To be plain honest, having this compact Cyber-shot RX100M4 will become my ""bring-around"" camera. Personally as a film maker, i like to rubberneck at people's life, but it's impossible to bring my big DSLR or cameras around. This camera could help capture moments and also assist my ""photographic mind"".$$It is an excellent choice especially during travelling and hiking. The weight and video/photo quality just crushes and blow the competition out of the water! You cannot find any other camera with such ridiculous nice shots for this size.

The video and photo quality at this size is just insanely good. It is comparable to dslr but at such a small size that fits conveniently into your pocket. 

The wifi sharing functions is excellent for sharing your media content as soon as you take them and share it with your friends online on your social media such as instagram, facebook and youtube.$$Liked and shared the post! I love the fact that the camera will be able to take good photos in low light as this is definitely something I know my phone (yup I can't do without my phone's camera but there's only so much it can do at night haha) can't achieve! I would love to take photos that captures the mood and lighting at that time so it can recreate the ambience just by looking at the photo! Plus it's so compact, I can bring it around without having too lug a big bag around! :)

Really hope to win this for my sister as she has been longing for a camera for her upcoming exchange programme! Can't wait for her to share her amazing photos with us while we are stuck here in sunny sg! Talk abt the convenience of the wifi function 😉$$The sleek body enable me to carry out in my bag and the camera act like a DSLR. With the feature of capturing better quality picture in low light setting, this definitely help in capturing nicer picture in a low light setting restaurants or environment. Then I can upload my picture immediately to instagram with the in-built wifi!$$The ability of this pocket-friendly and sleek camera to capture quality photos in even low light is extremely appealing! Moreover, this seems highly convenient to carry around for people who are always on-the-go and would like to do so without the extra weight of a conventional DSLR. :)$$Liked and Shared! If you ask me what my favourite function of the SONY Cyber-shot Camera, it would definitely be the Super High Speed function in which I can take perfect candid photos of people around me. I love taking candid photos of people as these photos are usually the ones which show the real emotions of people at that moment. With this function I would definitely be able to take super clear and photos of high quality!$$SONY's Cyber-shot™ DSC-RX100M4 is a powerful compact camera which is super convenient for me to carry around during my mandatory weekend adventure. Extremely suitable for Instagram addicts like me!

One of my favorite function would probably be the Aperture. With Aperture as low as f1.8, I'll be able to achieve sharp and define bokeh photos!

MOST IMPORTANTLY..... All its incredible features made it suitable for all occasions, anytime and anywhere! Say no to all ugly and blurry photos and welcome a new generation of clear and sharp photography! ALL HAIL SONY!$$Love the compact size of this camera which doesnt compromise on its photo quality! The size makes it so convenient and is a camera which i wont be too lazy to bring out as compared to those bulky dslrs.$$I have never own a professional camera before so actually all the functions from SONY Cyber-shot are what I need to be able to snap my memories and help me to fulfill my dream of starting up my own YouTube channel! ☺️$$Liked and shared! Love that the camera is handy, and able to capture photos sharp and clear. It really matters when taking photos of food, every detail matters! 😊$$The 180-degree tilting LCD screen would allow me to take photos of a subject from a variety of angles, which makes it more interesting! The one-inch sensor means better photo in low-light condition. :)$$The in-built wifi for sure... What's the point of Instagram if I'm going to have to go home, transfer from the SD card when the moment's over? It's going to be great also for me to shoot my two furry kids with bokeh, giving it that dreamy look~~~$$Liked and shared !! 

I love the low aperture capability. It's absolutely crucial especially in low light conditions in indoor locations.

""... Reality check in gender equality in Singapore. However, given the reality - supported by surveys - that the burden of care for children and the elderly still falls largely on the shoulders of women, current laws remain relevant. Giving a divorced woman maintenance is a way of levelling the playing field for her in a system that devalues her non-market contributions to the marriage.

Restrained at the wrists, and escorted by plainclothes policemen, 41-year-old Philippe Marcel Guy Graffart arrived at the State Courts in the morning in an unmarked police car looking dazed and tired.

He stood expressionless in the dock as the charge of murdering his boy, Keryan Gabriel Cedric Graffart, was read out.

No plea was taken from Graffart, who was dressed in a black T-shirt and blue shorts. He was observed looking around the public gallery.

Not the truth?

Singapore Police Force (SPF) latest reply still cannot produce any single evidence that can prove the status (dead, alive or missing) of my daughter, state her whereabout via written reply.

I really have doubt and confidence in SPF handling/ investigating/ response of missing 6yo minor in Singapore.

I will assume my daughter is still missing. Until proven otherwise, police report will continue to be make for missing 6yo minor. Unless there is evidence to prove otherwise, I still do not know or no one can prove where and how is my daughter since November 2013.

Has SPF make any investigation or taken any action against MSF/ MSF registered VWOs that are facilitating hiding of 6yo minor/ 6yo minor's info from her father WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights) since November 2013. They are the last known organisation that are facilitating hiding of a 6yo minor/ my daughter info based on email/ letter correspondence dated in 2014.

If SPF has done their due diligent investigation and concluded that my daughter is safe at a known location, why information of my daughter is not disclosed to me via written reply? Who is facilitating hiding and withholding information of my daughter WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights) from her father? Is this kidnapping/ hiding/ withholding a 6yo minor info from her father in Singapore?

I come back to the same question. I have not received any family court order that I am denied access to information of my daughter? So where is my daughter (dead, alive or missing)? Which government agency/ government registered organisation: MSF/ MSF registered VWOs is facilitating hiding of my daughter (now 6yo minor, missing since 4yo in November 2013), better come clean and admit it.? Is this kidnapping/ hiding/ withholding a 6yo minor info from her father in Singapore WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights)

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what’s around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to development in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into 
knowing existence.$$Chin Yee Ling Carmen Chai Yueyee Crystal Yap",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Marie$$Hi Gregory.  It was brought to my attention that my comment appears to call your photos ""garbage"".  However, the comment was directed at my own photos which I provided a link to.  

At the time, I shot in JPEG, something you know limits ones ability to make edits.  Also, I edited the photos with Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006, a weak editing program.  Furthermore, I used zero sharpening.  Thus, my photos are undeniably ""garbage"" compared to what they could be.  I still have the original JPEGs, so I plan to go back and use Capture NX2 and re-do the whole process.

Sorry for the confusion.  I wouldn't call another person's work ""garbage"" unless they asked for an honest opinion from me and I truly felt that way.

What is it like? 
Tubbataha Reef is a natural marine park that's considered as the global center of marine biodiversity. UNESCO has declared it a World Heritage Site, and in 1999 the Ramsar Convention in Iran listed it as one of the ""wetlands of international importance."" Explorations in the area have revealed that the park has no less than 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 11 species of shark, 13 species of whale and dolphin and even 100 species of bird. It is also the nesting grounds of green sea turtles and critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles. CNN Travel named it as one of the best dive sites in the world.

Fun Fact: 
Tubbataha is isolated, and can only be visited on a liveboard boat. There are no settlements on the islets in the area. Divers who want to visit and have an unforgettable experience must book in advance.

We have received multiple feedback that the queue has become INSANE. It's now a 2-3 hours long wait for a bowl of noddles and it is just not worth it. You're only going to end up disappointed and angry. The actual queue should be 10 minutes long, that's how long we waited originally.

They did NO PR and NO promotion. So they were completely unprepared to accommodate the sudden influx of visitors - they still only have ONE CHEF who does ALL THE COOKING.

Please wait at least one month for the hype to die down. Here's a picture of the queue that extended even outside the shop, taken by my friend alexischeong.com who went to check it out after we posted our blog.

So do visit this place, but only in a month's time or so otherwise you're going to end up disappointed. If it's a 10 minute wait, you will definitely love it as much as we did and that is how it should be experienced.

The Korea Tourism Organization announced on Tuesday the new tagline “Imagine your Korea” to replace the short-lived slogans “Dynamic Korea” and “Sparkling Korea.” While the former slog…,"I think you should use Facebook more to trial something new and to gauge opinion, rather than ask afterwards. This looks like it has been created on Microsoft word.... Also, 'imagine' isn't best word that could have been chosen. I agree with the above...'discover' is much better.$$Not sure.. it implies every person can imagine or have an ideal Korea the way they'd wanted it to be which may differ from reality.. I rather the word DISCOVER which invites to see and experience Korea through someone's own eyes.$$too simple. if i were a designer, i
prefer to make logo with brush (붓) to show sort of lightness and freedom like wing,
cuz what the word 'imagine' profoundly means and makes reciever think of it ..
moreover about the text: don't let them just'imagine' but carve in their mind of certain image.
it'll be much more important to discuss of what Korea can appeal.$$I entered that contest too and I'm a bit dissapointed about the new logo, I think it looks too bold :( That was my Application:$$Lol! .....I imagine a Korea where people are not racist , where foreigners get equal rights and opportunities and where big conglomerates don't exploit  international students(that are recruited) by cutting on their pay check and benefits while making them work long hours at the office. That would make the slogan "" Imagine your Korea "" :P Korea Tourism Organizationimagine >> reality$$Honestly, it does nothing to get me excited about Korea. Also it seems like it's aimed more at the domestic Korean tourist market than foreigners. Korea has so much natural beauty, history, culture and food...........this is what people want to see and experience. KPOP and Korean drama's are good and all, but show what the real Korea is about.$$Its nice..but how can you promote that much..your consulate in the philippines is very oppressive...there are about 800 delegates from philippines for a convention in seoul this september..but most of filipino delegates were denied of visa...most of the delegates had been to europe and australia but denied in korea.

What is that supposed to mean..?$$You have good tourism fair..but in other hand ita unfair$$Not good. ""Imagine"" not match for tourism sector :) *just2cent*$$Hem.. I Love the new slogan but not the logo.. Sorry but it looks rigid...$$I want to go to Corea.

In the picture on top, who is the man kowtowing to a Qing official in the scroll? Hint: He was a notorious 18th century pirate who used to stash loot in a cave on Cheung Chau Island.

1)	Chow Yun-fat
2)	Cheung Po Tsai
3)	Johnny Depp

Answer in one hour. Arr!


The answer, ye landlubbers, is 2) Cheung Po Tsai, who was said to have commanded an army of 50,000 pirates at one point. The character played by Chow Yun-fat in Pirates of the ‘Caribbean: At World’s End’ is based on him. (And Johnny Depp was in that movie too). 

The image of Cheung surrendering is part of a scroll telling the story of the Qing government’s defeat of his army of pirates.

As you are reading this letter, I bet that you have seen/heard about what happened earlier in our country.

Tourists were hostages of a policeman here, Rolando Mendoza. After a few hours of the horrible crime, some of the victims were dead including the hostage-taker.

I wrote this letter not just to apologize but also to let everyone know that we Filipinos are not all like Mendoza. We are loving and good-hearted people.

For so many years, our country has been standing tall and surpassing every dilemma; be it small or big. Years ago (back when I wasn’t born yet), you have watched us fight for what we think is right. We fought for the democracy of our nation.. The EDSA revolution. But that’s just one out of many.

Second. We Filipinos have been serving other countries for our families and we treat you as our own as well. With all due respect, I thank you all for giving us the trust through the years. For helping us to become what we are now.

The Philippines is more than just a group of islands. We are a nation of strong and remarkable people. A country of beauty and love known to be hospitable and well-valued. I humbly apologize for what happened tonight. No one in this world would want something like that to happen for life should be valued.

I politely ask the attention of the world. Please do not judge and mistreat us just because of what happened tonight. I have been searching the net and found terrible things. Hong Kong advices to avoid travels here, China and HK bans Filipinos and that Philippines is the worst place to go.

I can’t blame you for what you have decided but I hope that you could understand. Our country is now in a sea of problems. And I know for sure that we helped you in a way or another. Let peace and understanding reign this time.

I know that this letter will just be trash but I wish that you would understand. On behalf of the Philippine population.. WE ARE SORRY.$$FOR FREE !! to those from Hong Kong and Macao ! from now u can apply entry permit ""from the internet"" and then print it down, dispensing with NT 300, the period of validity of this entry permit application is three months long, and u can use it once for one month long staying Taiwan !

Why or what not?^^October 9th holds a very special place in the hearts of Koreans. It is the birthday of Hangeul, the native Korean alphabet invented by King Sejong (in power1418-1450).

The calligraphy of Korean is quite different, every syllable or line are made up of circles / ovals. Thank you for King Sejong who invented the alphabets, a day to remember.$$learning to read it was a breeze but understanding it is a different ballpark$$I also need to enhance my pronunciation and grammar.. it seems easy when you heard it from a native speaker; I may understand them at some point but it's hard to say it myself =( ..need more practice!$$well studying  hangul needs alot of practice, effort and patient..one of the hardest language in this planet...:-D$$hanguel easy to read but takes time to understand it..I still on process Hwaiting :DD$$Julie Wina & Rizza Lardizabal: You are both definitely right. It does take a lot of time (no one can learn a language overnight!) but still...it will be worth is someday.^^$$learning the letters and the sounds is very easy; leaning vocabulary and the grammar that goes with it - that takes time and practice$$For me because Hangeul has some similarities with Chinese, it's not entirely difficult to guess the meaning. But although learning to read and write is easy, the grammar can be a bit confusing. But it's ok, I'm still learning Korean now anyway! 지금은 한국어 공부해요~~^^$$Yes Hangeul is easy to learn, means that it doesn't take too long for me to be able to read Hangeul....$$i actually met alot of koreans here in philippines and they were surprise  because i can speak some basic Hangul..well,they just dont know that i learned those in dramas...lolz..$$I've actually been having a hard time trying to learn hangul!

A new bill protecting the rights of transgenders has passed in the upper house of Parliament and will be presented in the lower house this year. Last January, Madhu Bai Kinnar was elected mayor of Raigarh — the first transgender elected to run any Indian city.

Unlike in the United States, where L.G.B.T. rights are an issue too hot for many politicians to touch, in India homophobia is diffuse, and hardly features in our culture wars.

Baler's Cobra reef is a top destination for surfers. While Ampere beach is a favorite of photographers – located 20km from the surfing town. The beach is frequented for its distinct sea stacks and the large smooth boulders that make up its shore.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Baler then take a trike to Ampere Beach.

Or take a bus bound for Baler from Pasay.

Okotan Cave in Ampere beach is where residents go to forecast the weather. Waves hitting the shoreline cave create a booming sound. Its intensity determines how bad incoming weather will be.

Ladies and gentlemen.
I am the developer of environmental programs, and in particular for the production of fresh drinking and irrigation water, its purification and cooling.
If you have interest in my program in the Philippines will be restored all the rivers, and land, and underground reservoirs in the level and purity. This will increase the productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, increase in agricultural and meat dairy products), and forest tracts.
Finally, and most importantly, what needs to be done immediately.
Philippines - a country of many mountain formations. Mountain formation and adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates were many thousands of years in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And such or similar joints in the Philippines and around - many dozens.
Quote: ""The area of the Philippines is located in the zone of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, and even the coast of the Philippines is a zone of subduction, where oceanic crust is turned in under the mainland. subduction zone is also called the Benioff zone, because it has the largest number of deep earthquakes. ""
""In the Philippines, for the year on average, there is more than 35 earthquakes (on average by 3 earthquakes per month) magnitude of 5.0 - 5.9, one earthquake of magnitude 6.0 - 6.9 or 7.0 - 7.9, then this country can be considered one of the most seismically active areas in the world. ""
Physics. The warming heats the surface and underground rock formations of the Philippines. By law, all of physics solid crystalline formations expands when heated, destroying themselves and the surrounding formation, and form of the earthquake and tsunami.
The scheme is simple to prevent earthquakes.
My program is cooled all the big and small rivers. Rivers carry cooled water into the surrounding body of water Philippines, cooled water, and mountain formation, prevent the appearance of surface and submarine earthquakes and tsunamis.
For 10 years the ecology of the Philippines will be restored to the level of 1980. There basting to reduce the damage from the hurricane, the theme of excess current, but it is still in operation.

Winners will be chosen at random from all the valid entries received. ","I love Korea because it is the only country in the world that rose from poverty to become an economical power in this day and age and south Korea is a living testament of economical, political power in our modern day error, Korea will always be the Soul of Asia that is the reason why i love.It is calm, warm, polite, clean but without missing some Asian chaos; the people is incredibly nice and the food.. the food is amazing! Temples are beautiful and lots of mountains and parks around the country you can enjoy. It is a very safe place to travel around and cities have also interesting vibes and stuff going on.Korea is almost completely mountainous. Where the cities end, the mountains begin,I admire the way South Korea developed itself, it was a very poor country not so long ago.I want to visit south korea as just for the opportunity to experience a culture that is so different from our western cultures. Korea, even if it is a small country, has its unique culture, where traditions and innovations, old and new coexist. I would love to see  Haemieupseong Fortress, Rock-carved Triad Budha, Gaesimsa Temple .i want to see the 600 yr old hoya tree .i want  to take my  time in savoring the tranquility of this picturesque temple. Vasant Bokadia Gautam Jain Soni Shashi Hastimal Jain$$I would love to visit the birth place of Catholicism and learn about the beginning of Catholicism in Korea so Solmoe Holy Ground in Dangjin would be my  place of choice and I would take Kamoy Mclean Anna Marlok and Andrea Danciu with me <3 !!~$$I would love to take a break away from the busy city and visit the temples in Seosan Chungcheongnam-do  and also the Ganwoldo island with Nima Mudey, Rebecca and Rezwana Latif$$Definitely I want to visit Haemieupseong Fortress and Gaesimsa Temple with Aneta, Amby and Rochelle, Let's do it and travel to one of the most amazing country in this world!$$I love Korea but not just Korean I love all sorts of Asian cultres and one thing that I really like about Korea is the food, music, clothes, people, language. I love Kpop too but you people shouldn't bash people for liking or ""worshiping"" the singers that why there called ""Kpop idols"" and there is more music to Korea than Kpop. I hope one day I get to visit over there and see things like there Buddhist shrines and some of there Malls (Dongdaemoon, Namdaemoon, ETC.) Korea is a nice place and people  love it because Korea has a lot to offer! i have 2 reasons why i wanted to go there: 1) they are pretty much a ""green"" environmental community. 2) it's the technology capitol of the world!! moreover they seem to have the best looking people within asia from shows and things I've watched. But this is because beauty is something that they value over talent in so many entertainment industries. would love to visit as its my dream destination.e to see suncheon bay as Suncheon Bay is home to countless plants and marine life .i want to see Suncheon Bay Reed Festival that  is held every year in October, and ive heard that the bay is just as beautiful and charming any other month of the year.. as i love marine life it wud interest me much.  Vijaya Sakhala  Chandrakala Mutha Hemant Kataria Kavita Bokadia Gyan Jain$$Although I was in Korea more then 10 times, unfortunately I have never been inside the Myeongdong Cathedral and I have not been to Seosan city. I thinks it is a city with a very long history starting from Baekje period. But of course there are much more places which I have not seen yet. Recently many foreigners visit Seoul but for many non-Asian foreigners the biggest attraction is a countryside, Buddhist temples, places that coloured with oriental beauty, not the contemporary midernity, although DDP is gourgeous as well. Let's go see Korea one day together Наталья Похолкова Daria Nevskaya Иван Сиротин$$I guess Seosan is the place to be. Seems so beautiful! I want to go there with my lovely friends Mirella NavaJesse GamboaReinna Marie Ang 洪正蕾 . stamp tour seems neat too.. :)$$It was truly amazing to know that our Pope Francis will be visiting Korea.  And if I really have a chance to see him, I would be very proud and honored a bonus plus if it's in Korea because Korea is a very beautiful country with so many Catholic martyrs.  And that is such an inspiration too. Definitely I would love to see Haemieupseong Fortress, Haemi Martyrdom Holy Ground, Gaesimsa Temple or Solmoe Holy Ground.  Hope to see it with two good people I have missed travelling with Monica Manaloto Mendoza and Nori Amargo. God bless Korea.$$I want to visit Solmoe Holy Ground of Dangjin with Priscilla Leung, Eric Chan and Christopher Fung

Tell us your answers in the comments section, and keep sending us your stills, videos and blog posts for a shot at being featured. ","Para Sa Mga Nagdadalawang Isip Para Iboto Si Mayor Duterte please read this:

The attacks against Mayor Duterte is so intense. I've never seen such attacks against a frontrunner in the past 2 National Elections. With just few days left, these will even intensify. If you are a supporter and thinking of withdrawing your vote for Duterte because of his issues, brace yourselves and remember the reason why you supported Duterte in the first place. We've started from the bottom, now we're here. Change is coming. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future. This man has a huge sincere heart that I believe will benefit the country.

Maraming nagsasabi na ""if you want change, start in yourself at wag iasa sa magiging pangulo."" I agree, pero wag nating kaligtaan na marami ding mga tao na kahit kaya nilang simulan yung pagbabago sa sarili nila, kailangan padin nila ng isang tagapanguna na kaya silang tulungan na mangyari yung pagbabago na hindi lang sa sarili nila kundi sa kabuuan ng isang bansa. I believe that Duterte is the man.

Everytime he talks about his country and the change that he wants to bring, he is very sincere. Para siyang stand-up comedian bago magstart yung 2nd debate sa TV-5 (joking about Mar going to restroom and not knowing a single person from the audience), nakakatawa. He is known for his gutter language at offensive siya minsan. Sabi nga ng iba parang di siya nagiisip bago magsalita. But everytime he speaks about his love for the country and concern for his fellow Filipinos, he is very sincere. He has the most heartfelt messages. Sincerity makes the very least person to be of more value than the most talented ones.

He is also the candidate na hindi uhaw na uhaw na maging presidente. I believe it’s because his heart is really for the people and not for the position. He said many times that he will not die if he does not become a president. He said he will not apologize for who he is even if he lose the presidency.

While the other candidates in the last debate promoted themselves as the rightful president and expressed their confidence in winning the election, he simply said, “Wala akong hangarin except for my country. And I pray to God that the nation will be enlightened with His Grace, and you can choose the leader, bahala na kayo kung sino, the one who can make it happen.” Did you see that? Tayo na daw bahala. Di niya tayo pinipilit o pinapakiusapan na siya ang iboto. Also notice, his desire is for the country and his prayer is not for the people to be enlightened by his track record, leadership and platform (though those were really good), but be enlightened by God’s grace. He did not rely on himself and his achievements, he entrusted everything in the Grace of God.

I don’t want to sound like a priest but I hope that the religious leaders noticed it too. Only Duterte and Miriam mentioned in their closing speech that they are praying to God for the welfare of this nation. You see? Si Mayor Duterte, palamura, womanizer daw, corrupt daw, murderer daw, in other words makasalanan. But he is seeking God’s grace in this endeavour.

I’d rather support this “sinner” who depends on the grace of God than those religious leaders and self-righteous politicians who depend on themselves. I’d rather vote for someone na hindi “disente"" at hindi atat na manalo kaysa dun sa sumisigaw na siya ang mananalo. I will choose Duterte for his sincerity and desire to make sure that his fellowmen are safe and free from criminality, drugs, and corruption.

Sabi ng karamihan magdesisyon daw ayon sa character, moralidad, at kakayahan ng isang kandidato. Nope, ang desisyon ko ay base sa sinseridad at pagdepende ng kandidato sa biyaya ng Diyos. Because God’s grace can transform someone’s character and morality into better. But it cannot change a self-righteous person simply because they won’t even see the need for that Grace because they just depend on their own goodness.

Now, what if one day I realized that I supported the wrong person? Then be it. Life goes on. We just learn from it. In fact, we have been making bad decisions in electing Senators, VP and President in the past. Who knows this time, we’re making a good one. They say that a vote for Duterte is a high risk. Well, I'm taking the risk because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. I don’t really think that this 71 year old man would like to be remembered as a bad leader. I believe that he wants to leave a legacy that will change the course of this country.

It is apparent that there is a very strong opposition to stop the Davao City Mayor. But the greater the opposition, the greater the opportunity. An opportunity to stop the dominion of the elites and oligarchs. An opportunity to fight, suppress and stop drugs, crime and corruption. An opportunity to clean the government and the system. Change is coming. Lets DU it! Duterte for President!$$Amazingly captured by me in my hometown Gumaca,province of Quezon during my vacation..$$Nice shot  ...

Here are some things You Never Knew About Traffic/Parking Enforcement Officers (A.K.A Fatimah)

Because LTA enforcement officers are really just doing their job.

http://www.ladyironchef.com/2014/12/traffic-parking-enforcement-officers-fatimah/It is most definitely a Singaporean thing to call our car park attendants and traffic wardens ""Fatimah"". We are not too sure how it started too, but the term","why do LTA motorcycle officers behave like they're Traffic Police ? just what is their training? is it specialised training?? Exactly what are their powers ? does it included any power to arrest members of the public? are they allowed to engage in pursuit of suspected illegal vehicles? members of the public have been speculating all of the above questions and more, perhaps someone could give some insight as to just what their powers are?$$👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 as much as I empathize with the pay structure and all. It still doesn't give them a right to behave like they are the king of the roads. Yes, civilians should not try to challenge the existing traffic rules, but LTA wardens should be a little bit more forgiving?  
I have personally seen taxi/Lorry driver uncles running with their might to get out of the No waiting zones . And all I see is an unsympathetic warden pressing with their might on that summon machine like they are playing the final stage of game of thrones. So yah~ whatever it is. 3 million BOoooos 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻$$If I was the LTA officer and any member of the public comes so close to me in menacing way, I would have threw the punch too. Whatever the hell is it, you respect one's personal space. You want to scream and shout, you do it at reasonable distance. But if you come right up to my face, inches away, threatening me, all bets are off.$$Problem with Singaporean is they like to challenge public servant. Do public servant owes you a living ? They are just doing their job. If you don't flout any rules then you will not have to face them. The main thing is the public always like to give excuses such as "" only a few minutes or just once "". And if public servant gives them a foot then they expect a yard. Judge your own attitude first before you judge the public servant. Reflex on yourself, your use of words, your tone and most of all your many excuses.$$For certain area surveillance camera works very well . Minimise conflict between human , if Drivers want to pay $300 for their convenient , it is ok.. So next time use robot to issue summon ticket to those Drivers who do not know the rules .. If you want to fight robot go on .. Robot will not get agitated no matter what you tell it ..$$My personal opinion, these so call LTA enforcers r just piece of shit, when really there r illegal parking, they r no where to b found but when u happened to park at carpark or loading/unloading bay exceeding the timing, u will c a fine ticket at ur windscreen$$This so called LTA are mostly foreign bastard ! Want to come singapore and show their power ! LTA should stop employing them$$Why should we need to know . Bottom line, is beating up a civilian part of your job too?$$I saw the video on the LTA officer punching a uber driver and is being suspended of all duties. However the video also clearly show LTA officer being provoked by the uber driver whispering into his ears b4 lta officer swing his punches. Although there is no excuse to the fight however condemnation at this stage ia uncalled for.$$Sure bo? 12 hrs work 6 days a week for $900 only per month govt job? Thats 72 hrs a week.$$As much as we need to empathize their job..they shld also show more empathy especially to those delivery drivers, cab drivers etc. i am very sure these so called ""law-enforcers"" do not abide by the law themselves all the time as we can so often see them on social media parking by zig zag and double yellow lines, den went off to buy food or smoke..it's a two way respect if they want to be respected, they shld respect others and show more empathy in the first place .. Pls understand everyone is trying to earn a living and it's already a stressful thing to live in a FINE city.. More empathies will make this society a better place$$Most of the traffic/parking enforcement duties are now outsource to companies on contract basis like Certis Cisco, Aetos, Ramky, ST Technologies etc. If the contracts are not renewed, the traffic/parking enforcement officer will most likely start all over again from the base salary with another company and as a result will most often not see an increase in their salary.$$Why thankless job. .think we will be thankful without them leh.... haha$$If u cant endurance those vuglar , then dont join those service line or related government job.$$Walking pieces of shit.$$I wanna join LTA too beating and fighting FOR FUN AND THE BEST punishment IS ONLY
GOT SACK 
Haha worth it$$Every job has its own stresses and ups and downs. Doesn't justify beating someone up just because you don't like your job.$$This idiot lta (cisco) guy shout first before this thing happened. Read first before comment ! He's fucking idiot ! Think he wear LTA uniform very big is it$$If beating up is part of the job, let me know🤓$$Nonetheless I still despise them.$$Agree they are just doing their job but some of their attitude SUCKS...$$I won't be surprised a bill has already been passed to allow LTA officers to punch civilians.

I.
The world we live in, has become a battlefield, 
Between the innocent and the evil.
The people we love, becomes a slave no one heals,
Because of the dreadfulness that tempts them to kill.

II.
Innocent lives have been taken to oblivion,
The people behind this may not feel the frustrations.
Of their families, friends, and their children's children,
Making this a dark and sorrowful world we live in.

III.
After years and years of sorrow and pain,
It's our time that peace and unity should be maintained.
Let us hold hand-in-hand to eliminate all evilness,
Until our world becomes a planet of happiness.

IV.
Let us shout for freedom, unity, and peace,
Our God looks at our world with hope and ease.
One day, all sources of evil shall vanish before our eyes,
Making the planet we live in, peaceful and unified.

Rizal became also a member of the Grand Orient (the equivalent of a Grand Lodge today) of France as per available historical records. Thus, if our national heroes were inspired by the masonic principles of ""Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"" way back then, so was France during the French Revolution. I am sure that ""Kuyang Dimas Alang or Dimasalang"" - the masonic name of Jose Rizal which was customary during the time wouldn't mind having his monument be draped in the national colors of France. May ""Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"" triumph over religious fanaticism & ignorance once more.$$We stand for world peace! Not for selective humanity!$$the colors of the philippine flag...$$Salamat po , merci,thank you, it's very important to feel supported by the internationnale community. I love my country, France, with all my heart.  I fell in love with your country, Philippines, with your culture and with your citizens, but this temoignge of sympathy make me uncomfortable. France would make it the same thing for you? Has she already made it in past? But again thank you!$$doesnt necessarily mean that you change your facebook pic into the tri color french flag therefore you remain deaf to the cry of the rest of the world,
otherwise using that kind of logic means that we are merely depending on the numbers of casualties and not the problem itself,
you might suggest turkish, afghan, iraqi, syrian flag and other african nations as an alternative,
its not about the french craze or western imperialism that we do so, rather it is the fact that those people are also victims of senseless killing and we cannot just accept any feasible reason to justify that.
my profile pic is not in question in here,  so long as your sentiments and prayers goes to the victims and you do not tolerate those acts is actually the point,
and you are one with the world in agony of condemning terrorist of murdering people in the name of an alien principle which is not human at all,
in fact how many billion dollars was and is presently donated to the syrian civil war victims - the world knows exactly what we are facing today
even world leaders are quick to respond just by the picture of the toddlers dead body on the shore
even Germany the mastermind of genocide of jews are welcoming these refugee is now doing the exact opposite.

you do not sympathize in regards to killing as to the number of victims,
this is not a poll related matters or survey,
its like saying, since turkish bombing provides greater casualties therefore turkish flag is better and because paris attacks recorded only a 100+ death toll maybe we have to used the french flag next week or next month,
does it makes sense?
otherwise if we subscribe to that kind of mentality then we are literally moving backward.

cguro kung uso na yung fb nung 9/11 cguro nagkulay america na ung fb not because of its superiority among nations but simply because those acts of terrors are really out of reasons!! its not human!!!
and that sentiments is shared among nations regardless of status and not just by a marginalized group.$$i admire , the Filipino people. United we Stand, Divided we Fall........ im from Austria, im proud to be  Filipina....$$Hypocrisy at its best... Remember SAF44? 'Misencounter' and didnt even attend the arrival honors... We stand in France But I Duck and care not to my fellow Filipinos.. :@$$Pray not just for Paris but for the world... Especially for the Lumads that was killed by PNoy Allies.$$Why do people have to turn something meant to be supportive to Paris/France into a subject of inequality or hypocrisy? I have the French colors as a part of my profile picture not because I live in France or to jump the bandwagon but because I share the same belief of condemning these attacks wherever they happen. Period.$$I actually see the Philippine flag though. Red, blue, white, and yellow in the middle of white. :))$$These people are so stupid. When Haiyan struck the Philippines, even France set aside its own problems to help our country. We are just doing the same for them now. This is not even an issue of who is supporting what. We are showing our support because we are being decent humans.$$parang phillippine flag color lang di pero amg ganda lets pray for the victims of paris france victims and hope that war will stop as soon as possible and let peaceful country be free again against the terrorist.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.

This elegant festival actually lasts for one month in July, and has its two highlights, Saki-Matsuri, procession of 23 gorgeous floats will be held on July 17th, 9 am to 11:25 am and Ato-Matsuri, a procession of another 10 floats starts at 9:30 am on July 24th. 
Yoi-yama (Festival Eve), all floats with lighted lanterns are exhibited on the Shijo- Karasuma Area, is held on the evening from July 14th to 16th, and also from July 21st to 23rd. 
Not many people know about Byobu Matsuri (Displaying folding screen). During the festive period, from July 14th to 16th, the old textile merchant homes open up the entrance area of their homes or shops once a year. This would be an absolutely great opportunity.

Tubbataha Reef, Palawan

What is it? 
Tubbataha Reef is the mecca of Philippine diving, and a superstar in the international diving scene. It's accessible only by live-aboard dive boats between the months of March and June. You have the chance to marvel at 11 species of sharks, over 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 12 kinds of whales and dolphins, and get this — 10,000 hectares of reefs.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

Fun Fact:
Aside from being a marine sanctuary, Tubbataha is also renowned for being a bird sanctuary. A lighthouse islet, at the southern tip of the South Atoll, supports a large number of seabirds which nest there.

The facility was built using a modern interpretation of traditional Japanese architecture and interior design. It features a variety of traditional arts and crafts such as urushi lacquer, Nishijin woven silks, bamboo woodwork, and so on.

In land-scarce Singapore where couples fight tooth and nail for the last BTO unit near the MRT, these things are often overlooked in the frenzy. Here's a quick crash course on Adulting 101: Buying Your First Flat in Singapore. 

GoBear is giving away 4 funiture swag packages worth $250 each to jazz up your new home! All you gotta do is: 

Step 1: Like and Share THIS post 
Step 2: Comment and tell us what you think are the most important things to know for new homeowners.

Contest ends on 22 Nov and winners will be selected at random. Good luck everyone! :)

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/first-flatWe know buying a flat can be the most stressful thing you've ever done - even more so than doing your PSLE all those years ago. Here's some tips to help hack your way to home ownership!","Congratulations Kent Gan, Emma Gem, Ajeek Syasya, and Michelle Lim! You've all been picked as the winner for this giveaway. Please PM us with your Name, IC number, and Email Address, and we'll get back to you soon :)$$Homeowners should get to know the culture of the community they live in. For example, what are your neighbours like? Do they dislike pets? Get to know the people around you. That's important.
Another thing new homeowners must know is their own financial capabilities. I'm sure budgeting concerns were taken into consideration before buying a home, but with new budget constraints, homeowners must now know how to appropriately spend within their means.$$New homeowners need to play with their numbers in terms of financially by calculating, comparing and considering what is within their means while not over budgeting causing financial woes down the road.$$For new homeowners, it is important to protect your biggest investment, make smarter decisions, and avoid costly mistakes. We must consider the finances carefully.$$Liked and shared this post!
Answer: Check your keys. Make sure each key, even the one for your letter box, opens the corresponding doors properly.
Hope to win TheSmartLocal.com GoBear! ✌💝$$Firstly, thank you TheSmartLocal.com for this generous giveaway! Well in my opinion, I think one of the important aspects is that the couple must have good understanding of their financial capabilities. For example, to go for contractor instead of designer, in order to save some cost. Also, to go for more practical items. Sometimes, simple is beauty (lesser cost is involved). 

My hubby Neo Wei Xian & I are waiting to receiving our HDB keys soon! It will be a great surprise if we can be awarded with the furniture swag package!! :D$$I think it is important to know the value of the neighbourhood that you are buying.

I think the organizers want to help foreign ppl buy tickets but don't have the manpower or foreign language abiltity (usually concert organizers dont even seem to consider overseas guests), so they contacted agencies abroad, and those agencies are selling for a profit at market price.

All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one 😂😂 damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london 😍😍 my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it 😂$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin – Singapore’s 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy! It's the most unforgettable dining moment.$$There's this place where you pick what food you want, and it get delivered to you like a speed train on a conveyor belt after the chef has finished your order.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

But was deeply disappointed I met a cheat recently. This Hong Konger named Chris Luk posted of extra tics to a concert. After money was transferred and we kept in touched for 2mths, he disappeared when meeting arrangements was done. Such a disgrace to Hong Kong. The mobile number he contacted on is 852 6093 8696.$$Such a wonderful place , our young family have so much good memories visiting hongkong$$Your city has a sister city relationship with Seoul, the capital of South Korea. But I question whether the majority of citizens here would be comfortable with the relationship if they knew of the horrors inflicted on hundreds of thousands of dogs in South Korea on barbaric ‘meat dog’ farms. 
In South Korea, thousands of dogs are kept crammed in filthy metal cages. They’re fed on the carcasses of other dead dogs, and they’re deeply distressed from a combination of boredom and terror. 
It is the middle of a South Korean winter, there are dogs shivering and whimpering in freezing, open cages. They live their entire lives in factory farm conditions. They have no freedom, no affection, nothing that makes them feel good. And they’ll be butchered so humans can eat their meat. I have heard of the atrocities—of dogs and cats being boiled alive. Of dogs being baked. Of family dogs being stolen and cooked. The fact that people know this happens and turns a blind eye is not acceptable. To do this is to condone the dog meat trade. It is despicable and one of the basest practices that happens as an industry on this planet. 
As Mahatma Gandhi once said, “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.”
I ask that your publication bring attention to two important issues: 
•	the existence of the dog meat trade in South Korea

One signboard with too many confusing inforaiton. And the Heading is: INFORMATION. And that is the only legible word.  KTX ticking is another big confusion: no return tickets, foreigners need to be a MEMBER to get discount (who cares to be a MEMBER?), and schedules all in Hangul, and ticket office no one speaks English. SUNCHEON Bay was high on my agenda. But I dropped the idea because moving around in Korea is pretty painful. Maybe I will drive my relative's car down south next time. I am not here to Spike Korean Toursim Board. But you really have to put your act together to improvement tourism in Korea. No wonder Tourist only know Seoul and Busan, and miss out ALL OTHER cities in Korea. Putting Sun Cheong here is meaningless, because for an enthusiastic tourist like me, (even if I read Hangul), its too painful to get from Seoul to Sun Cheon, and a risk of getting stuck in Sun Cheon with no hotel/motel to stay overnight.$$Yes indeed!

4. WOW! You actually still book hotels based on stars!!! Impressive. Why not look up tripadvisor and marvel at the reviews of this worn down hotel?

5. Really? You prefer to go up the mountains to do that? You mean you can't do that in singapore? Oh MY.

6. Nice, you mention it's cheaper than singapore, but than the whole malaysia is. What you fail to mention is that places like penang and KL are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. Picking at straws already?

7. i'll sponsor you glow sticks, if you actually think bowling in a glow in the dark bowling arena is fun, and worth a trip to genting. 

9. It'll be exciting for five minutes, until you realise you're looking at just trees tres and trees. Have you never been on that cable car?

TLDR; poorly written article, worst i've ever read on travel. Load of lies.$$I've just came back from last weekend genting trip...can't say I don't enjoy because I did especially when you're with the best people, it doesn't really matter where u go.. 

The food nope..I could only count two good enough place to eat and the others are just fast-food if you're okay with it.

We played arcade for fun and karaoke and just bask in the cool air.

The only buffet we had was  coffee terrace but I saw one big cockroach over there near the coffee and tea. Enough to put me off that station. But the other food spreads are good enough,thank god.

The customer service over there have dramatically declined. SERIOUSLY. Plus, check-in time at 3pm. And if you are to check in at the counter, there's a charge and if you were to check in early,there's also a charge. Plus, pay your precious wifi and can only use at the lobby. Just go starbucks people and chill and get ur coffee and wifi there. 

Other than that, I will still go Genting just for a short vacation with family or friends. My best holiday place is Bangkok still though, first on my list. 👍$$1 reason not to visit for now.

What is it? 
The town of Anilao may not have white sand beaches, but its underwater environment is its biggest attraction. Dubbed as the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines, its deep waters teem with marine life and an abundance of corals and reefs. For non-divers – the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

How to get there: 
Take a bus to Batangas from Cubao or Pasay.

Fun Fact: 
Diving conditions in Anilao are ideal for divers of all experience levels. The water temperature is consistently warm, and the surface is typically calm and smooth throughout the year.

Also dry weather can makes mountain fire. It makes big damage to our environment and asset. We had better to wait in march or more warm day.$$Even in the outlaying rocky areas? Sounds like South Korea is on the same path as the USA. We're having major land grabs here being carried out by our BLM, government land management organization. Our largest farming lands are being stolen, especially those that sit next to federal wild lands. Like, around the Rocky Mountains and the Smoky Mountains. If you have a large farm here... you're going to lose it. The idea that Korean parks are closing to the public is outrageous and beyond belief to me.
