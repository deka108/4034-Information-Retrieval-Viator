Let's connect and brothers help me save the little girl who needs our help, and remember, that you Japanese not-to-face refuse help me, because you are Japanese and this says it all. Oss!!!

Brothers and sisters, Feb. 10 in Paris, Darya Glazkova( Dasha) had a third operation on the brain. The operation was successful, but happened complications of small excerpt and girls delayed in hospital for another week for the treatment and survey. Brothers Japanese and friends - people of good will, the family baby needs your help and support and I ask you for the sake of the memory of our spiritual teachers Sosai Oyama and other Martial Arts and all that is holy for you to help the family Dasha - who as you can. 50 or 100 euros for you it's not money that would do for your family weather, and for family Dasha and for most Dasha - is the ability to save lives. Help save the baby, and remember, that your help child, it you are helping themselves, because it a matter of honor for you, as the pioneers of lifestyle and other Kyokushin Martial Arts which is equal to the world of military brotherhood and self-respecting Japanese person - never refuse to help me coach - disabled (which is at the cost of their health, honor and prosperity - more than 30 years, defended and promoted your culture today needs your help) and a small child and I believe in you, brothers. The required amount of money help purely for the operation - 9700 (nine thousand seven hundred) EUR, together with additional costs due to the complication and unforeseen circumstances: extension of the course treatment for a week, pay for the travel, residence of parents, food, payment of an interpreter - in total about - 20,000 (twenty thousand) euros. 

I know that I have no right you order, but I can not keep and quiet, because we are brothers in spirit and way of life of Kyokushin and other Martial Arts and tomorrow on my place or place this child may be you or your child (do not let God) and you'll need the help of others and in this case you will have the right to call someone to help you and you are not afraid, that people just refuse help you - as refuse and you, because no one in this life itself does not survive, because people are always helping each other and it God's law which has not been canceled and have whether you're right - it is ignored? Here and think as you be brothers and yes helping you God and your conscience take the right decision.

( I do not have NO MORE excuses not to visit them... I was glad I was in a little recovery, I did my travelled alone and shared my story to my ONLY TWO sisters I was divorced... I did not see my eldest sister and brother at that time because I still tried to AVOID any question... because I do not want them to feel bad or give them any worry) the ticket was cheaper to compare IF I purchase or did transaction in USA. ( more money)..............  Long time ago my husband and I arrange our hotel somewhere in Philippines (Island).. the hotel room in US dollar (work for dollar and spend into dollar is fine) is acceptable BUT it is too much for citizen of the country to convert the currency of money. FOREIGNER visiting other country their money have more value (exchange rate)... some foreigner (let's say a rich person CAN afford to visit or  purchased other Island or business investment) .... BUT ... it is also depend to what and who... another example: It is depend LOCATION, a small house (from estate or agent) to conversion of money (let's say dollar to pesos) In Philippines a decent house is more expensive to compare to the house I used to have...  When my brother-in-law (french) visited us ... just for KNOWLEDGE or idea, still the house in Philippines more money to compare to the houses around...... another example: My parents want to build a house they have in mind.... so they do not want to LOAN to the bank (which they are qualified to do so at that time)... my mother do not want any worry. so she saved money and pay cash for piece of land. And saved again then when enough to build a decent house THEN they start the building the house.... what is the different is that THE LAND (per square foot) IS SO EXPENSIVE to compare to other area (location) the piece of land worth can be three time worth to other area. SO in everything includes PLANNING, BUDGETING, asking REASON why it is necessary.... what is the GOAL...........  I ask my mother why our house and land is small to compare to our neighbors because we have big family (in our area... our neighbor have one child, next have three children, and next have one child).... mother explain to me.... LOAN is nice to the EARS but painful to HER (mother) pocket.... Yes, she is qualified to borrow money to the bank but she made the right decision.... heaven knows best our neighbor work as a government employees and some privilege or benefits opportunity.... deductible from their salary BUT and BUT be CAREFUL to any retirement money (invested)  BECAUSE their house can be foreclosure and wasted all the money they gave (or paid). ANOTHER EXAMPLE: You purchased a land (sq ft as you like) and transaction you already gave certain amount of money. THEN duration period with interest monthly to pay the balance of land purchased... let's say contract is two years... One years you put effort to pay BUT then stop because something happen (loss job or emergency prioritizing)... with five months late payment and with interest... MORE you cannot afford to pay, so it will be thank you to you.... TIME and EFFORT of hard work was gone, just like that. I am so deeply thankful and grateful for the opportunity I question my mother for some stuff I do not understand and with her warm heart never get tire to express her thoughts and feelings to some CERTAIN situation.... mother do not like to share problem BUT I am thankful because Signs and symptoms of language of thoughts and feelings.. I know my mother because even I was just a little kid I UNDERSTOOD tender loving care through action. From fetus as passive immunity (warm caring heart) acquired and immune response with gentle gracious warm heart. One of the reason I can read their thoughts and feelings because I do not know, I just feel it. BECAUSE I spent time with them. Word is silent because Silent is action.. Tender Loving Care is not only a word but ACTION as verb. The side effect was EFFECTIVE because I am  thankful and grateful  to my beloved parents, siblings and loved ones with their warm HEARTS..... CURRENCY ... a money conversion to some with higher value and to some same value and to some low value............................. Tender Loving Care is like a CURRENCY BOND.... value in legal tender. (I am not talking money to this sentence, but a principle of morality).$$I believe you need a Virtual Assistant. :P",1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name ‚ÄúBantayan sa Hari‚Äù (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to ‚ÄúBantayan,‚Äù the name it's known as today.

Philippines has so much to offer but are beaten by the likes of Thailand because they have infrastructure, order, unity in their goal to promote their country as a place for tourists. The Philippines should strive to lay it out well to make it a place to remember. Word of mouth from best experience is the best way to sell it. Davao and Mindanao have the best beaches in Asia but yet even a Filipino will not go there because its not safe for foreigners. There are no economical means to travel safely around Manila because of fear of being mugged.

2. Couldn't see the summit nor crater lake due to heavy fog and rain. 
3. I felt it was very dirty up on the mountain which surprised me and disappointed me at the same time. Too much litter left......and......the toilet situation was terrible! Not only was it very very smelly the toilet paper was going down the side of the mountain. Terrible!

about an hour ago ¬∑ 
An Appeal to the United Nations from a former Filipino Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly

I am Michael Francis Acebedo Lopez, a Filipino and a former delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. Nearly ten years before the questionable rise of one Leni Robredo to the Philippine Vice Presidency, I had the honor of representing my country, the Philippines, as the youngest Filipino delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in its history. I also had the opportunity to be the Philippines‚Äôs first actual Youth Representative or Delegate, a partial fulfillment of our commitment to the UN‚Äôs World Programme of Action for Youth or WPAY. 

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accepted my letter of credential signed by the Philippine Foreign Minister. There it was stated that I was attending the General Assembly ‚Äúas Adviser to the Third Committee Plenary Session on Social Development, including questions relating to the World Social Situation and to Youth, Ageing, Disabled Persons and the Family.‚Äù In the august halls of the UN World Headquarters in New York, I also had the honor to draft and deliver the Philippine Statement to the General Assembly‚Äôs Third Committee. 

In light of Vice President Robredo‚Äôs video message to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs posted on TIME Magazine‚Äôs website and shared by various media organizations, I am recalling the mandate I was once given in an effort to reach out to all of you, member states of the UN and all organizations within the UN System. If said mandate is not sufficient because it has long since lapsed, I am hinging my appeal therefore on my being a natural born citizen of one of only four Asian nations who signed the 1945 Charter that created the United Nations. 

I am making this urgent appeal on behalf of each and every Filipino grossly misrepresented by our a Vice President in said video message, a Vice President whose own mandate has been called into question, with the highest electoral tribunal of the land, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, having considered the election protest against her win to be sufficient in both form and substance. 

With unfounded claims and unsubstantiated allegations, Vice President Robredo wantonly painted an impossibly grim image of the Philippine situation if only to attract international attention and action. To say that she delved in speculation is understating the gravity of her made-up claims and the severity of the damage she has caused on our country and our people in so doing. In reporting to the world what she failed to report to Philippine authorities, assuming there are actual reports received by the Office of the Vice President, she has not only embarrassed our country, she has betrayed the public trust and committed economic sabotage, both punishable under Philippine laws. 

For her to say that ‚Äúour people feel both hopeless and helpless‚Äù is a brazen lie. Confidence in the presidency is at an all time high (while the same cannot be said of the vice president whose approval ratings continue to plummet); as a people, we feel hopeful and empowered like we‚Äôve never felt before. 

Please understand that at the heart of this is destructive party politics. It is the Vice President‚Äôs party flexing its muscles to overthrow a duly elected government so they may once more regain control of government. Perhaps she feels time is running out for her because of developments in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal. So she and her allies have launched an expensive campaign using human rights and the War on Drugs as their excuse to bait the world into interfering in our domestic issues. 

When the Vice President says 7,000 people have been killed in the President‚Äôs War on Drugs, she fails to mention that this is set against the backdrop of around 700,000 to one million successful arrests and surrenders. So the figure she presents to you is not even one percent. And surely with the sheer number of those involved in the illicit drug trade, some police operations see suspects resisting arrest and fighting back and the police having to defend themselves resulting in casualties. Every war has casualties. It is not a perfect war and I‚Äôm certain there have been abuses along the way, and these need to be looked into and those responsible must be brought to justice. But exaggerating things does not help at all. 

In asking for the international community, the UN, to intervene, she uses the issue of human rights. Let us then talk about human rights. 

In responding to the call of Robredo, the international community must tread carefully lest it encroaches on our very sovereignty and our right to self-determination. And as a sovereign state, we have determined to wage an internal war (not a war against another nation) against the evils of drugs, a direction affirmed by our democratic processes when President Duterte who included the War on Drugs as one of his main programs of action, received an overwhelming mandate during the May 2016 Presidential Election. In short, the War on Drugs, by extension, has the people‚Äôs mandate. 

Any effort to disturb our democracy and sovereignty as a response to the Vice President‚Äôs irresponsible and unfounded claims will subvert the will of the Filipino people and violate our Human Right of Suffrage enshrined in both the Philippine Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 21 of the international covenant). 

Once again, I am making this appeal to all member states of the United Nations and all organizations within the UN System to disregard the Philippine Vice President‚Äôs statement which is, I reiterate, a grave misrepresentation of the prevailing sentiments of our people and a gross perversion of the facts surrounding the War on Drugs. 

To my fellow Filipinos, let us remain vigilant in the face of threats to our democracy by the very people who claim to defend it. Ako po‚Äôy nanawagan na i-share ang video na ito upang ito ay umabot sa UN at sa iba‚Äôt ibang foreign governments.

I'm sorry that you are having difficulties with immigration.  Unfortunately the Korea Tourism Organization does not deal with visa issues.

I work over there so i was hoping she could come over for 2 months holiday but no way around it with immigration. $$There are a lot of issues with illegal immigration from Southeast Asia, so I suppose they have to be careful about it.

There are many reasons really why I wanted to travel to Korea for its great history, culture, food, sightseeing, for his music, everything is really impressive.
I would love to go first visit to Changdeokgung Palace, which belonged to the Joseon dynasty and be impressed by the great harmony between traditional bellaza and nature, it is also one of the few palaces that still preserves the architectural style of the Joseon Dynasty and one of the most beautiful among Eastern palaces ~~ !!! because it is also a UNESCO protected heritage and incidentally also go to Jongmyo Shrine and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty which shows the greatness of the Joseon Dynasty and see all the majesty of its historic charm !!
Then would visit Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon which is a more advanced representation of his time, also visit Gyeongju which is the capital of a dynasty that ruled the Korean peninsula for many years, then go to the Historical Complex Gyengju to contemplate large relics which is very impressive that still have an excellent state of preservation, then go to the Grotto and Bulguksa Seokguram Buddhist temple which dazzles me for its architecture, art and beauty of his nature also feel very relaxed by the great harmony and energy to be surrounded by great nature !!! and then go to the Yangdong Folk Village, Gyeongju and Hanoe Folk Village in Andong and appreciate traditional Korean houses !!! which dazzle me by the way he is love !!!!
Then I'd like to visit to Jeju-do Island go to Manjanggul which is regarded as the route network tunnels formed by lava world more beautiful !! It is also one of the best islands in the world ~~ see autumn visit this beautiful and impressive volcanic island is really very beautiful, see the blue sky becomes so beautiful and the woods surrounding mountains mentras the wind rushing around to another, see the beautiful flowers and cultuvos is really beautiful is a unique experience !!!!!!
Going to Korea and visit historical sites is a unique and unforgettable experience !!! incredible would be if I could walk on my stay at Seoul which is considered one of the most impressive and technological capitals !!! I also want to go to Myeong-dong and Dongdaemun which is the center of fashion in Korea !!!!! enjoy the delicious Korean food which is considered a very healthy and nutritious health food !!!! eat much pork kimchi, bulgogi with soy sauce and bibimbak which I love !!! would buy handicrafts and souvenirs from Korea to have it always pass ~~ I would buy cds of k-pop, because I really like the k-pop groups like Big Bang, Super Junior, JYJ, sistar, MBLAQ ..... I love you very much !!!! are the most fabulous ~~ !! also take the cable car, and there obserbar city with breathtaking scenery !!!!

I didn't know he's actually quite fond of the Philippines and her people. 

Mabuhay!$$No words are enough to describe how i feel about your article,you nailed it right in the head Mr Bourdain, thank you very very much God bless$$Yeah, he loves Filipinos, right behind Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam, countries he repeatedly visits and profiles on his show.$$Philippines with Anthony Bourdain
Vists the Filipinos learn about the country$$The majority of the Filipinos are awesome people, but just like any other country, they have corrupt government officials.$$It's an incredible country with incredible people.  There is so much I can write about them but all I can say is, how wonderful to see another episode on this country.$$Dear leaders of the Philippines!
Offers its program to restore the water balance of the Philippines, and the elimination of surface and underground earthquakes.
In the Philippines, will be carried out work on the restoration of rivers and ground and underground reservoirs in the level and purity. This will increase the productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, increase in agricultural and meat dairy products), and the cultivation of new forests arrays.
Finally, and most importantly, what needs to be done immediately.
Philippines - a country of many mountain formations. Mountain formation and adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates were many thousands of years in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And such or similar joints in the Philippines and around - many dozens.
Quote: ""The area of the Philippines is located in the zone of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, and even the coast of the Philippines is a zone of subduction, where oceanic crust is turned in under the mainland. subduction zone is also called the Benioff zone, because it has the largest number of deep earthquakes. ""
""In the Philippines, for the year on average, there is more than 35 earthquakes (on average by 3 earthquakes per month) magnitude of 5.0 - 5.9, one earthquake of magnitude 6.0 - 6.9 or 7.0 - 7.9, then this country can be considered one of the most seismically active areas in the world. ""
Physics. The warming heats the surface and underground rock formations of the Philippines. By law, all of physics solid crystalline formations expands when heated, destroying themselves and the surrounding formation, and form of the earthquake and tsunami.
The scheme is simple to prevent earthquakes.
My program is cooled all the big and small rivers. Rivers carry cooled water into the surrounding body of water Philippines, cooled water, rock formations both on land and at sea, to prevent the appearance of surface and submarine earthquakes and tsunamis.
During 7 years - 15% in a year - I chilled all rock formations to the level of 1980. There basting to reduce the damage from the hurricane, the theme of excess current, but it is still in operation.
One technology - ""Ladder"", which explains the principle of cooling rock formations, tectonic and lithospheric plates - I'm sending you. But it is more suitable for hospitals, schools, and kindergartens, and partially cools the water area around the Philippines. At the prompt, I'll bring the technology is three times more powerful than the ""Ladder"".

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what‚Äôs around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to development in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into 
knowing existence.$$Chin Yee Ling Carmen Chai Yueyee Crystal Yap",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and Sicogon Development Corporation (SIDECO) will launch Sicogon Island Tourism Estate development within the first half of 2016.

The ALI-SIDECO joint venture is expected to drive economic progress in Western Visayas and the entire region as it serves as a tourism hub for surrounding or nearby destinations like Gigantes, Bantayan and Concepcion islands.

The 1,100-hectare Sicogon Island will feature a balanced mix of developments, such as a resort town center, hotels and resorts, as well as commercial and residential establishments, supported by an on-site airstrip.  The ground breaking of the airport runway is scheduled for the second half of the year.

‚ÄúThe initial development will concentrate on building the airport and runway, to ensure accessibility to the island,‚Äù said Jose Emmanuel Jalandoni, ALI Senior vice president and group head of commercial business.  ‚ÄúThe 1.3-kilometer runway will allow immediate access from Manila and Cebu to the island development,‚Äù he added, saying further that test flights to Sicogon are being targeted for the first quarter of 2017.

The project is supported by public, private and community organizations, and government bodies alike because of the potential economic benefits it will bring to the region.  A framework agreement was signed by ALI, SIDECO, and the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk Association (FESIFFA) in 2014 to pave the way for the sustainable development of Sicogon Island.  The group has been assisting the local community through skills training and livelihood programs to make them active partners in the development.

‚ÄúWe strongly believe and hope that poverty alleviation will be achieved through tourism projects.  These will give us various job opportunities and help us improve farming and fishing methods,‚Äù said Raul Ramos, president of FESIFFA.

Jalandoni stressed that sustainability will be a main focus of the project.  Aside from allocating more than 50% of the development for open green space, ALI will also work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to continue stewardship of Sicogon‚Äôs forested area, and work on coastal protection and marine life rehabilitation in support of sustainable development.

‚ÄúMore than becoming a premier tourist destination and a tourism hub for the region, Sicogon is envisioned to provide inclusive growth and economic development through long-term recovery and livelihood programs, and job creation,‚Äù said Jalandoni.

ALI estimates that the Sicogon Island development will provide 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly with increased tourism, and approximately P1 billion in earnings for the community through business opportunities that will come from the retail and commercial establishments.

We leave our empty drinks in our movie cinemas seats. Random tissue papers are always floating on MRT seats. We choke drains with our cigarrates. And we don't even think twice about it. Because garbage on the street is better than in our pockets. 

Some of us have become so entitled that we say we ""help"" the cleaners by giving them a ""job"" to do. That's when you know something is wrong. Maybe that's why we don't return our food trays.

I'm guilty for being part of those groups at parties who don't clean up well, leaving cleaners with a ton of extra work to do. It seems normal when no one seems to care. But I'm not going to act that way again.

There are many shopping streets and shopping centers in -Guangzhou covering everything that you might need. Food from china especially dim sum and shopping is my favourite pasttime. Lynn Ngai$$I want to go guangzhou with my sister!! As we have never travel together since a really long time ago, and both of us have never been to guangzhou before..

We first met in poly, when his first impression of me was that I'm cold, aloof and distant; to me, he was a habitual latecomer. Our negative impressions of each other only improved when we were serving NS together; he sought me out thru MSN, and we started hanging out together, and got rid of the negative connotations we had of each other. We spent our nights out together and went clubbing til we were dead drunk on the evenings and bitched about horrible superiors in NS. Fast forward 6 years, our friendship is still strong despite hiccups along the way, and we are STILL bitching about our superiors, this time at work. So the free Guangzhou trip would be good for us to go on a holiday together ever since our last one a few years back! =)$$My buddy and I had never been to GuangZhou before. Meantime, as we are graduate from poly soon and planning to travel to GuangZhou for our graduation trip this year. this giveaways are surely suitable for us.

I want to go to Guangzhou because traveling to China and being able to experience it's colorful medley of sights and sounds has always been on my bucket list. China is a country steeped in history and heritage, and even with the inexorable modernization of parts of this vast, beautiful land, vestiges of that heritage remain with fierce resistance. It is this dichotomous existence of awe-inspiring futuristic buildings, modern landscapes, and yet age-old monumental structures and natural scenic environment of mountains and rivers that I seek to experience all in one place, and Guangzhou city is the epitome of that! I would probably cruise along Pearl River, visit Guangzhou's markets, witness for myself the phenomenal White Clouds Mountain, not to mention, go for some shopping (who needs Taobao when you have Guangzhou?!), relish the Cantonese cuisine (I want to taste the mouthwatering XIAO LONG BAOS!!!!!!), and the list might never end! Please take me to my wonder destination! ‚úàÔ∏èüá®üá≥

My father is also a huge fan of China which probably explains everything.$$Would love to SCOOT to Guangzhou as I've never ever been there!

Miriam is battling lung cancer. It is a fact. Miriam is sick. Miriam may die anytime. But, just like all men, Binay, Poe, Duterte and Roxas may die also anytime. Miriam is just sick, but remains highly capable. Everyone knows that on the basis of qualification, all candidates, except Miriam remains on top. It is a fact.

Miriam ran in 1992 for president. She won the votes, but lost in the counting. Cory Aquino's ally Fidel Ramos won. Miriam did not surrender the fight. She ran as senator of this republic. She worked hard as legislature. She has been an RTC Judge, Agrarian Secretary, Immigration Commissioner, and United Nations ICC Judge. 

Miriam has no ""City"" to base her competence. And Miriam has no 3-6 month-worth of promises. But, she has all her bills, laws, and track records to prove her worth. Decades ago, before the rise of Duterte, Poe, Binay and Roxas, Miriam has been the Master of Anti-Corruption and Anti-Crime. She was there since then and until now. 

Unlike other presidential candidates, even Miriam lost once, she is still now trying to succeed the Presidential race in 2016. This is a symbol of #persistence and #perseverance. This is the will to win!

This country needs a #wise president to decide where this country will be heading. We need a leader who has a strong conviction and philosophy. We need a leader who has law and governance #expertise. We need a leader who can be a #model to all members of the society especially the youth. We need a leader who has the capability to handle #international concerns. We need a leader who is respected by majority not because of his dictatorial skills, but because of his #wisdom to steward this republic. 

We need a leader who has #academic, #professional and #moral#excellence. We need a leader like #Miriam. 

We need a leader with #decency, #quality, #professionalism and #integrity. #credibility, #Dignity,  #honest.  Strong,  Brave and Bold ! Intellectually Brilliant Leader! WORLD  CLASS LEADER!

We need Miriam. 

Why would you vote for someone ""lesser evil"" or someone ""good enough"" if there is someone like ""best choice."" 

Why would I vote for Duterte, Roxas, Binay, or Poe, if there is Miriam.

I should, I suppose: my fianc√©e is from the Manila area) and it's a country that grips you and never lets go. Granted: NAIA will first deter you.

They speak good English, always have time for a smile and a chat and are generally very helpful.  Second:  the environment.  Don't be deterred by the urban jungle known more commonly as Manila but venture out to the islands.  I definitely developped a soft spot for Palawan and Siargao.  Accommodation:  like any county it knows the good, the bad and the ugly but usually the prices are reasonably (particularly when compared to anything we have here in Western Europe) and the service (this is definitely something I have come to love about the Philippines) is excellent.

The first time I've dived somewhere where the colours are just like ""in the pictures"".$$Martin - for your reference on diving in the Philippines$$Nice , also have Whale Sharks  ,seen pics people swimming with = Awesome.$$Republic of the Philippines Guidelines.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I am the developer of environmental programs, and in particular for the production of fresh drinking and irrigation water, its purification and cooling.
If you have interest in my program in the Philippines will be restored all the rivers, and land, and underground reservoirs in the level and purity. This will increase the productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, increase in agricultural and meat dairy products), and forest tracts.
Finally, and most importantly, what needs to be done immediately.
Philippines - a country of many mountain formations. Mountain formation and adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates were many thousands of years in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And such or similar joints in the Philippines and around - many dozens.
Quote: ""The area of the Philippines is located in the zone of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, and even the coast of the Philippines is a zone of subduction, where oceanic crust is turned in under the mainland. subduction zone is also called the Benioff zone, because it has the largest number of deep earthquakes. ""
""In the Philippines, for the year on average, there is more than 35 earthquakes (on average by 3 earthquakes per month) magnitude of 5.0 - 5.9, one earthquake of magnitude 6.0 - 6.9 or 7.0 - 7.9, then this country can be considered one of the most seismically active areas in the world. ""
Physics. The warming heats the surface and underground rock formations of the Philippines. By law, all of physics solid crystalline formations expands when heated, destroying themselves and the surrounding formation, and form of the earthquake and tsunami.
The scheme is simple to prevent earthquakes.
My program is cooled all the big and small rivers. Rivers carry cooled water into the surrounding body of water Philippines, cooled water, and mountain formation, prevent the appearance of surface and submarine earthquakes and tsunamis.
For 10 years the ecology of the Philippines will be restored to the level of 1980. There basting to reduce the damage from the hurricane, the theme of excess current, but it is still in operation.
Sincerely, environmental programs developer Victor Rodin.$$Yes! Marvelous Philippines. Thank you for promoting our nature's gifts. I appreciate very much.$$Nice!

12:42. This
is based on a TRUE STORY! Once there
was
a baby
girl named Marry. Her mother couldn't
take
all the
crying, so she decided it was time for her
to
go. She
buried her baby alive in her back yard.
After she
buried her she could still hear Marry
crying.
So she dug her back up and stabbed her
one
time in the arm,
and buried her again. Marry cried harder,
but a few
hours later it stopped. At exactly 12:42,
Marry died.
She bleed to death. Now her sprite
haunts
the
world. When your sleeping, she stabs
you in
the
arm and watches you bleed to death.
And
that's how she got the name ""Bloody
Marry"" this is the true story
of her. She wants everyone to feel her
pain
that she
felt. Apparently, if you re-post This isn't

see a little dead girl in your room tonight.
In the next
53 minuets someone will say I love you

I'm sorry
to 12 other comments you will have the

It‚Äôs a ferry ride to Hong Kong Disneyland! Check out the details of Star Ferry's Water tour here: http://bit.ly/2kIZwO0$$This trip is amazing I did it on the 9 th Jan for my 60 th birthday with 6 other friends we did the lunch package which includes the boat crossing and lunch or afternoon tea at the Walt hotel , we went on the 11 am ferry and came back on the 6 pm ferry it takes about an hour each way but there is a bar on board and your ticket includes a drink and snack the trip back is lovely as it dark and you see Hong Kong in its glory , the meal at salts hotel  was very nice and they also made me an amazing birthday cake , you also get access to the Disney transport so we went and had a look around all the hotels ,the cost was approx ¬£40 per person including lunch but just the round trip is about ¬£20 , we were lucky enough to be treated like royalty on the boat as we were the only 7 people on it going out and on the way back there were 4 more people but they were tour guides . Worth doing for a special occasion$$I was in HK a few years back, been  on the star ferry but did not know there was a disney land ?? Is it recent?$$Once in a lifetime experienced Jan 28, 2017 ... its Chinese New Year... from Macau to Hong Kong... and its raining hard when we get there... oh oldies like us can't enjoy the Disney land any more just picture pictures only... happy enough at the gate rather than to pay that much anyway its raining you cant do much walking too inside... do other options back to the malls and do some window shoppings.... happy enough  :-)$$Took my 4 kids here whilst on a busman's holiday 2 years ago, and they loved it, the ferry was great. Disney here is to me just the right size for a day out, but boy was it humid. :) Can't wait to return, neither can the kids.$$We were in Hongkong three times already the last two years ago. We are going again on February 27 for a week tour. Hope the temperature goes up as it is so cold there now.$$Overpriced Disneyland? Should have taken the ferry to one of the many gorgeous islands to enjoy a nice day on a good beach instead :P$$oh can you get the ferry from hk island to disneyland? i will be in hk tomorrow..$$We were also there Disney  Land was our fave  palibhasa we are still Kids je heje$$Maybe u can check tree of life or google it, it may be of help .

On to Gyeongju another very interesting place - lots of history and tombs of the Shilla monarchs, also temples. On to Busan then take train to Daegu. From Daegu you can take a bus to Hainsa Temple and see Tripitaka Koreana - the world's most ancient storage facility of Buddhist scriptures - fascinating. Jeonju another interesting city and you can wander around the Hanok village all day, lots of tea houses and craft shops. Be sure to try bibimbap - specialty of that area.

We hope the beautiful setting in Club Med Bintan will be a good place to learn to like the sand, sun and sea more.$$I want to experience the Club Med hospitality! It's all-inclusive type of stay is really one of a kind. With so many activities and F&B options to choose from. Plus exploring the areas outside the resort like the Chinese temple with the 500 statues (must be some story to that!) and the new mall Plaza Lagoi! Let me win please!$$I would love to win as we have never been to Bintan despite living in Singapore five years. Looks like so much more to do than I realised and totally worth the trip after all!$$Kids are amazing but nobody told me I would never sleep properly again! Bintan would be a great battery recharge while exhausting the kiddies at Club Med activities. 
And OMG did u say JETPACKs?!? That's a total dream come true....remember those projects when you are 7 where you draw the imaginary future? Mine was flying around on JETPACKs! I must have been visualising the Bintan holiday I won??? üòò$$I would like to win this trip as Bintan is my first holidays with my husband when the time we married.A lot of memories and we hope to bring our son along to share with him .Club Med fits into the travel Plus Bintan has so much interesting places and the seafood is so shiok.$$I should win this trip because I've always been a huge lover of the beach and the sea. My ideal vacation is one spent by the waters, reading a good book, and occasionally getting up to snorkel or engage in other water sports. What got me the most excited about this post though, is #2, where it mentions a plane ride with an experienced pilot. My boyfriend is an avid flyer (SO avid that he can tell you the exact engine codes once he hears an airplane fly past. No kidding.), and his dream has always been to be a pilot himself. Though he hasn't been able to do so, he loves all things to do with planes and coming on this trip would give us the perfect opportunity to extend our stay and engage this pilot! It'll be a lovely surprise for him :)",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/first-flatWe know buying a flat can be the most stressful thing you've ever done - even more so than doing your PSLE all those years ago. Here's some tips to help hack your way to home ownership!","Congratulations Kent Gan, Emma Gem, Ajeek Syasya, and Michelle Lim! You've all been picked as the winner for this giveaway. Please PM us with your Name, IC number, and Email Address, and we'll get back to you soon :)$$Homeowners should get to know the culture of the community they live in. For example, what are your neighbours like? Do they dislike pets? Get to know the people around you. That's important.
Another thing new homeowners must know is their own financial capabilities. I'm sure budgeting concerns were taken into consideration before buying a home, but with new budget constraints, homeowners must now know how to appropriately spend within their means.$$New homeowners need to play with their numbers in terms of financially by calculating, comparing and considering what is within their means while not over budgeting causing financial woes down the road.$$For new homeowners, it is important to protect your biggest investment, make smarter decisions, and avoid costly mistakes. We must consider the finances carefully.$$Liked and shared this post!
Answer: Check your keys. Make sure each key, even the one for your letter box, opens the corresponding doors properly.
Hope to win TheSmartLocal.com GoBear! ‚úåüíù$$Firstly, thank you TheSmartLocal.com for this generous giveaway! Well in my opinion, I think one of the important aspects is that the couple must have good understanding of their financial capabilities. For example, to go for contractor instead of designer, in order to save some cost. Also, to go for more practical items. Sometimes, simple is beauty (lesser cost is involved). 

My hubby Neo Wei Xian & I are waiting to receiving our HDB keys soon! It will be a great surprise if we can be awarded with the furniture swag package!! :D$$I think it is important to know the value of the neighbourhood that you are buying. By choosing a prime neighbourhood and location to set up your home is important. Some key factors include public transport options, accessibility to shops or medical clinics, and whether there are schools in the vicinity that will tie in with my family planning. I will also want to ascertain the value of the neighbourhood for future investment purposes.

All the pictures and videos being shared online on Taiwan have got me dreaming of it constantly..... Hopefully I'll be able to visit it soon! ‚ò∫Ô∏è$$I've never been to Taiwan before but always wanted to. I would love to try paragliding and diving in Taiwan! And all my friends who have been there always tell me that the foods are super!! So, foods, here we come!$$Taiwan is my annual to-go country! But year in year out, it's time to experience Taiwan like I've never before! Didn't even know that one could do paragliding in Taiwan prior to this post!$$I am looking forward to catch the magnificient sunrise view from Hehuanshan mountain! I have heard that Taiwan has many nice hiking places with beautiful natural views which I hope to experience there also! What's more, its always a regret for me not going to wulai for the hotspring when I been there few years back.

In addition, instead of just travelling to mainstream places where everybody frequents, I like to venture off to the unbeaten track and explore new things, just like the experiences mentioned in this guide!

Lastly, I hope to win this trip for 2 to Taiwan!$$Went to Taiwan for a few times but never have a chance to explore the counties & city outside Taipei city. For my next trip to Taiwan, I am looking forward to explore Taiwan's local culture from town to town by taking the Taiwan slow train.  This is one of the best way to understand the history & culture of each town as well as enjoying he beautiful scenery along the way! Best of all, I can have a chance to try out many delicacies & street food in different towns, as well as the must try platform bento from vendors at the train station!

Hope to win this to visit Taiwan again with my husband!$$I just got back from Taiwan last month and didn't manage to tick any activities off this list!! I would love to go for the rafting and night shrimping session if I had the chance to!!$$My BFF and I have never been to any overseas trips together and we really hope that the organiser would grant us this opportunity to explore the charm of Taiwan. The major attractions of Taiwan to both us are their well-reserved natural tourist spots and the Taiwanese's people friendliness that can be seen in TV. We really really hope to feel Taiwan and best of luck to both of us so that this small little wish would be granted!! 2016 is the 'Time for Taiwan!!!! Florence Chong Huey Lin .üòò$$I've never been to Taiwan before cos I don't trust my own standard of Chinese to survive there on my own... so winning the ticket means I can bring someone along (more proficient in Chinese) with me to survive the trip. And I wanna try paragliding! I've not had a chance to try it but it's something I'd wanted to try, cos it looks like something doable for a chicken-hearted me. üòÅ$$I've only been to Taipei once briefly and fell in love with the warmth and hospitality of the people there. However, I would really love to bring Victor Neo to Taiwan for his grad trip as he has never been, and it would be super duper awesome to discover the cool local stuff we can do in Taiwan with TSL and KKday's great recommendations. What I would really look forward to doing are the adventure sports such as rafting down Hualien mountain and also paragliding across the sky! *v*$$Hoping to win this trip as a gift to my significant other's parents! They loved everything about Taiwan on their last trip here 2 years ago. Every time Taiwan is mentioned, they can't stop reminiscing about how good the night market food is in Taiwan.

Thus, the activity I'm looking forward to the most for them is definitely exploring the numerous night markets across Taiwan!

--------------------------------
The only hill station in Rajasthan, Mount Abu is both a popular hill resort as well as a place of pilgrimage since the famous Dilwara Jain temples are located here. It is a pleasant green oasis of lush forested hills set in the barren desert scape of Rajasthan. 

Mount Abu is situated at the southern tip of the Aravali range, the hill retreat owes its cool climate to its rich flora covering the entire hillside that includes coniferous trees and flowering shrubs. During the period of the Maharajas, it was used as a place of leisure by the royalties. The place presents an interesting contrast of British style bungalows and holiday lodges with various tribal communities residing amidst the thick lush forest on the hills surrounding the region. 

The tribal community of this area still maintains its pristine ways of living despite progress of the modern times.

I recall with fond memories when I was young and going to the omni theatre with family. The excitement builds up as I queue to get in so as to get the best seats in the house. Usually I will sit close to the projector in the middle of the room and marvel at how it rotates. The film are short and we will then walk to a room of exhibitions and learn about science , solar system etc. About 7 years ago, I went again and was sadden by how run down the omni was and in an era of digital films, omni is no longer a draw. I look forward to the new revamped omni theatre and bring back it's glory! Please pick me!$$Always remember going to the science centre when I was a child,  but never to the omni theatre!

Ladies and gentlemen!
I present to you a few suggestions to eliminate the negative impact of warming and a significant increase in tourist business. You miscalculated them, and if the proposal will be acceptable to dock and start working.
First.
If the work will begin immediately in January 2016, by the beginning of tourist season, I'd have to produce fresh water:
First. This innovation will make it possible in the spring of 2016 tourists drink crystal clear water pristine purity.
Second.
Use this water for watering can summer 2016 travelers will feed organic products straight from the beds, and it will provide an increase of tourists to 10-15% per year. Plus, the constant increase - parents with children with physical or mental defects. In subsequent years, innovation will be piloted by the tourists, and increase the flow of tourists will grow.
In the Philippines, it is also restored all the rivers, and land, and underground reservoirs on a level and clean. This will increase productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, the growth of agricultural and meat dairy products), and tracts of forest.
Third.
The large influx of tourists will force the government of the Philippines to increase the construction business for themselves and for sale. This will lead to an increase in employment in the construction business and dozens of related companies
Finally, and most importantly, what needs to be done immediately.
Philippines - a country many mountain formations. Mountain formation and neighboring lithospheric tectonic plates and many thousands were in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. That is what happened in the Indonesian nightmare when the tsunami killed 250,000 people. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And such or similar joints in the Philippines and around - many dozens. Programs of all types of cooling plates and joints are.
For 10 years, the ecology of the Philippines will be restored to the level of 1980. There basting to reduce damage from hurricanes over the current theme, but it is not yet finalized.

An Appeal to the United Nations from a former Filipino Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly

I am Michael Francis Acebedo Lopez, a Filipino and a former delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. Nearly ten years before the questionable rise of one Leni Robredo to the Philippine Vice Presidency, I had the honor of representing my country, the Philippines, as the youngest Filipino delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in its history. I also had the opportunity to be the Philippines‚Äôs first actual Youth Representative or Delegate, a partial fulfillment of our commitment to the UN‚Äôs World Programme of Action for Youth or WPAY. 

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accepted my letter of credential signed by the Philippine Foreign Minister. There it was stated that I was attending the General Assembly ‚Äúas Adviser to the Third Committee Plenary Session on Social Development, including questions relating to the World Social Situation and to Youth, Ageing, Disabled Persons and the Family.‚Äù In the august halls of the UN World Headquarters in New York, I also had the honor to draft and deliver the Philippine Statement to the General Assembly‚Äôs Third Committee. 

In light of Vice President Robredo‚Äôs video message to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs posted on TIME Magazine‚Äôs website and shared by various media organizations, I am recalling the mandate I was once given in an effort to reach out to all of you, member states of the UN and all organizations within the UN System. If said mandate is not sufficient because it has long since lapsed, I am hinging my appeal therefore on my being a natural born citizen of one of only four Asian nations who signed the 1945 Charter that created the United Nations. 

I am making this urgent appeal on behalf of each and every Filipino grossly misrepresented by our a Vice President in said video message, a Vice President whose own mandate has been called into question, with the highest electoral tribunal of the land, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, having considered the election protest against her win to be sufficient in both form and substance. 

With unfounded claims and unsubstantiated allegations, Vice President Robredo wantonly painted an impossibly grim image of the Philippine situation if only to attract international attention and action. To say that she delved in speculation is understating the gravity of her made-up claims and the severity of the damage she has caused on our country and our people in so doing. In reporting to the world what she failed to report to Philippine authorities, assuming there are actual reports received by the Office of the Vice President, she has not only embarrassed our country, she has betrayed the public trust and committed economic sabotage, both punishable under Philippine laws. 

For her to say that ‚Äúour people feel both hopeless and helpless‚Äù is a brazen lie. Confidence in the presidency is at an all time high (while the same cannot be said of the vice president whose approval ratings continue to plummet); as a people, we feel hopeful and empowered like we‚Äôve never felt before. 

Please understand that at the heart of this is destructive party politics. It is the Vice President‚Äôs party flexing its muscles to overthrow a duly elected government so they may once more regain control of government. Perhaps she feels time is running out for her because of developments in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal. So she and her allies have launched an expensive campaign using human rights and the War on Drugs as their excuse to bait the world into interfering in our domestic issues. 

When the Vice President says 7,000 people have been killed in the President‚Äôs War on Drugs, she fails to mention that this is set against the backdrop of around 700,000 to one million successful arrests and surrenders. So the figure she presents to you is not even one percent. And surely with the sheer number of those involved in the illicit drug trade, some police operations see suspects resisting arrest and fighting back and the police having to defend themselves resulting in casualties. Every war has casualties. It is not a perfect war and I‚Äôm certain there have been abuses along the way, and these need to be looked into and those responsible must be brought to justice. But exaggerating things does not help at all. 

In asking for the international community, the UN, to intervene, she uses the issue of human rights. Let us then talk about human rights. 

In responding to the call of Robredo, the international community must tread carefully lest it encroaches on our very sovereignty and our right to self-determination. And as a sovereign state, we have determined to wage an internal war (not a war against another nation) against the evils of drugs, a direction affirmed by our democratic processes when President Duterte who included the War on Drugs as one of his main programs of action, received an overwhelming mandate during the May 2016 Presidential Election. In short, the War on Drugs, by extension, has the people‚Äôs mandate. 

Any effort to disturb our democracy and sovereignty as a response to the Vice President‚Äôs irresponsible and unfounded claims will subvert the will of the Filipino people and violate our Human Right of Suffrage enshrined in both the Philippine Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 21 of the international covenant). 

Once again, I am making this appeal to all member states of the United Nations and all organizations within the UN System to disregard the Philippine Vice President‚Äôs statement which is, I reiterate, a grave misrepresentation of the prevailing sentiments of our people and a gross perversion of the facts surrounding the War on Drugs. 

To my fellow Filipinos, let us remain vigilant in the face of threats to our democracy by the very people who claim to defend it. Ako po‚Äôy nanawagan na i-share ang video na ito upang ito ay umabot sa UN at sa iba‚Äôt ibang foreign governments. 

Maraming salamat. Thank you and good evening.

Overall filipino cuisine, when trying to imitate European or American tastes, has left me greatly disappointed. Plus: While most ordinary filipinos are warm and welcoming, in restaurants they seem to not have a clue about hospitality. This accounts especially for touristy areas, where you will often find lacklustre Italians or even German restaurants (most of them owned by italians or germans who clearly have no passion at all). Filipino cuisine, unlike most pundits will tell you, does not have to hide from other cuisines at all. You can get absolutely delicious dishes, for example in Restaurants in Makati. Simple Lang - Ayala Triangle was the best Restaurant i visited during my last trip. So please do not try to imitate Italians in a sad way, stick to your own cuisine and be proud of it - you surely can!$$My wife and I had the pleasure to taste Gaita's famed cooking when she came to visit Edinburgh and was invited as an honoured guest of Kuya Greg and sister Isabel Fernandez of Lyncliff Hotel.

AND - rumor has it that the TIC will be receiving a very special guest...at 10:30 KST this morning!

The exhibit runs until December 25th, but right now we don't think there will be any more K-pop stars making appearances. We'll let you know if anything changes, though!$$Winter in Korea occurred in the month of December to early March, now to enjoy the winter in Korea are some pretty interesting places to visit by us. Nami Island or also called Naminara Republic. Located in Bangha-ri, Namsan-myeon, Chuncheon-si originally not an island. This is the island Bukhangang River, which was made as a result of dam construction Cheongpyeong. Circumference is about 6km, and the area is 430,000. There grassplot than 260,000 in the middle of the island. Nami Island is a beautiful and interesting island to visit with family, friends or spouse during the spring and winter. Because in addition to having natural beauty, Nami itself has a sweet romance and memories when we visit there. And that is strengthened by the story of a love story of the drama 'winter sonata'.

You must already know the story korean drama ""Winter Sonata"" which players Bae Yong-jun, Choi Ji-woo and alm. Park Yong-Ha. Winter Sonata is a love story that is able to anesthetize the audience. The story of this drama is about love first has enormous power. Power is capable of uniting the two lovebirds even though many things have become hindrance of their relationship. Almost certainly you'll like the 2002 series is made in Korea. Besides interwoven stories that are packed very beautiful, background paronama winter is very captivating to watch. Nami Island in the drama is created, so Nami Island became world famous.

In addition to Nami Island, Winter in the city of Seoul is also quite interesting to enjoy. Because along the sidewalk in the winter, many vendors sell snacks winter is quite popular as roasted sweet potatoes, roasted chestnut, hoppang kind of steamed bread, and bungeo-ppang fish-shaped bread that is in filled with red bean paste. Although Korea has grown rapidly and is more modern, but traditional snacks are still there and not change and can bring us back to childhood for the ancient Korean society. Winter in Korea is very cold, windy and dry, so this is a nightmare for our skin. Do not forget when you come to Korea during the winter always apply moisturizer to the skin that are not easily dry and wrinkled. Hehehe ......

If a vacation in the winter, not afdol if not try the game skating on the ice at the Everland amusement park is popular in winter. Skiing and snowboarding are the most exciting games in the winter, because it's a lot of visitors who arrive in this Everland. In winter there are also several festivals are held to enliven the winter, like Taebaeksan Snow Festival. This festival is one of the most interesting festivals in the country and popular Korean ginseng and this wave. In addition, tourists can also enjoy a visit there and follow the race to form snow with a gift that was quite interesting. Kite festival in the winter is also quite interesting in Korea. Not to mention the concerts are held in this season, which presents K-pop that has been popular in the world, such as Super Junior, Shinee, Fx, SNSD, Beast, TVQX, Wonder Girl, Big Bang, 2NE1, T-ARA and other other. Well, how do you want to try a visit to the State which will terkanal ginseng, natural beauty, culture, and his K-POP in this winter ??.....C'mon guys visit in the korean.
The ski travel program includes daytime activities such as ski instruction, amateur ski competitions, snowboard competitions, and sledding competitions, while featuring some nighttime events like Korea traditional dance and modern performances. There are also a number of additional special events, discounts and free gifts for visitors.
In the recent years, the number of Southeast Asian tourists for the winter season has increased because of the snow covered mountains and the fun and thrills that are offered at the ski resorts in Korea.

But is Sweden really better than Singapore? This Swedish guy made 2 videos to say: NO.

https://mustsharenews.com/singapore-sweden-videos/","I think Singaporeans take housing for granted the most. Across the world, house ownership is a pipe dream for an entire generation of millennials. Not to say housing in SG is perfect, but at least it's attainable.$$Having to visit Stockholm a month ago, I tend to agree that SG is better than Sweden (while I do like their architecture). Their cabs are insane, no regulations and touting for business and ridiculously priced. The licensed one that I took cost me S$80 from airport to city and the drive said unlicensed ones can cost up to S$200... Unlike other Scandinavian countries, people there don't seem to be as friendly or happier... Food and transport were also more expensive than Denmark and Finland, even public areas are dirtier than their 2 counterparts. So yeah, I'll pick SG anytime over Sweden$$Why bother to compare and say which is better? There will always be things that are better on 1 side but there will also be things that are worse. It's like when you are in school and got 89 marks for your test. And then your mom comes and say why u no like the other kid who got 92 marks and ignoring the fact that your 89 mark is actually the second highest, better than the other 30 kids in the class. Sigh....$$Be contented with what you have. Singaporeans complain too much. If singapore was so bad then please give up your space to someone who will appreciate it more.$$The grass is always greener on the other side, there's no perfect system of governance, just a better balance of left and right...$$Singapore is great if you can afford to uber everywhere like the  Swedish guy,  or afford private housing which that guy seems to ('much more attractive option anyway' or something like that)$$Sure you wanna compare?
... Singapore government taxes us More than 300 over percent for buying just a car, and that's exclude the earnings our local car dealers are profiting in the process$$Malaysia even much better than both countries provided you are not align to any politics here . Expatriates with their salaries have a wonderful life here.$$I think he forgot to compare salary vs living cost to yield expendable income, it is not fair to compare just area vs area without comparing the above. For vandalism and subway, I agree that SG is way better than any other country (except HK :P) due to absolute strict law. No cigarette butt due to strict law again. Glass door on subway station and the safety cone on construction area / road is for safety and to avoid subway company and government bodies being sued by passenger accident. While due to strict law, order is there always. This area Singapore always better than any other country in the world.$$Rubbish article. In SG, most of the time you do not own the property but rent it for 99 years.  And that is full rental payment up front upon signing the ""ownership"" lease.

Transport is easy becos we are a small city.  MRT?  Rofl!  Really?  Dun think all our MRTs have screen doors.  All of them started WITHOUT screen doors and we had our share of people being pushed or fell onto the tracks.

He should really do more research before posting this fake news.$$Might as well compare our houses to mansion houses and say we are deplorables? 

This goalpost changing where everyone has their own criteria is annoying.

Only if they have lived abroad for a few years will they then know its Great To Be Home (SINGAPORE). i HOPE THIS VIDEO BY STEFAN WAKES SINGAPOREANS UP ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG ONES.$$Housing and transport. SG is only better if you have 3 to 4 times more cash than the middle class folks in these countries. And sg weather is hot and humid uncomfortable!$$The girls in Sweden are hotter.

According to the Cordillera myth, the Ifugao people were created from Wigan, the god of Skyworld. Legend has it that Wigan gave the rice-terrace farming Ifugaos the first sacred rice.

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn‚Äôt a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 ‚Äî known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It‚Äôs only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They‚Äôve got water and waves to spare.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Surigao (one hour), then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a bus from Manila or Davao to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a boat from Manila to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

","I love Korea because it is the only country in the world that rose from poverty to become an economical power in this day and age and south Korea is a living testament of economical, political power in our modern day error, Korea will always be the Soul of Asia that is the reason why i love.It is calm, warm, polite, clean but without missing some Asian chaos; the people is incredibly nice and the food.. the food is amazing! Temples are beautiful and lots of mountains and parks around the country you can enjoy. It is a very safe place to travel around and cities have also interesting vibes and stuff going on.Korea is almost completely mountainous. Where the cities end, the mountains begin,I admire the way South Korea developed itself, it was a very poor country not so long ago.I want to visit south korea as just for the opportunity to experience a culture that is so different from our western cultures. Korea, even if it is a small country, has its unique culture, where traditions and innovations, old and new coexist. I would love to see  Haemieupseong Fortress, Rock-carved Triad Budha, Gaesimsa Temple .i want to see the 600 yr old hoya tree .i want  to take my  time in savoring the tranquility of this picturesque temple. Vasant Bokadia Gautam Jain Soni Shashi Hastimal Jain$$I would love to visit the birth place of Catholicism and learn about the beginning of Catholicism in Korea so Solmoe Holy Ground in Dangjin would be my  place of choice and I would take Kamoy Mclean Anna Marlok and Andrea Danciu with me <3 !!~$$I would love to take a break away from the busy city and visit the temples in Seosan Chungcheongnam-do  and also the Ganwoldo island with Nima Mudey, Rebecca and Rezwana Latif$$Definitely I want to visit Haemieupseong Fortress and Gaesimsa Temple with Aneta, Amby and Rochelle, Let's do it and travel to one of the most amazing country in this world!$$I love Korea but not just Korean I love all sorts of Asian cultres and one thing that I really like about Korea is the food, music, clothes, people, language. I love Kpop too but you people shouldn't bash people for liking or ""worshiping"" the singers that why there called ""Kpop idols"" and there is more music to Korea than Kpop. I hope one day I get to visit over there and see things like there Buddhist shrines and some of there Malls (Dongdaemoon, Namdaemoon, ETC.) Korea is a nice place and people  love it because Korea has a lot to offer! i have 2 reasons why i wanted to go there: 1) they are pretty much a ""green"" environmental community. 2) it's the technology capitol of the world!! moreover they seem to have the best looking people within asia from shows and things I've watched. But this is because beauty is something that they value over talent in so many entertainment industries. would love to visit as its my dream destination.e to see suncheon bay as Suncheon Bay is home to countless plants and marine life .i want to see Suncheon Bay Reed Festival that  is held every year in October, and ive heard that the bay is just as beautiful and charming any other month of the year.. as i love marine life it wud interest me much.  Vijaya Sakhala  Chandrakala Mutha Hemant Kataria Kavita Bokadia Gyan Jain$$Although I was in Korea more then 10 times, unfortunately I have never been inside the Myeongdong Cathedral and I have not been to Seosan city. I thinks it is a city with a very long history starting from Baekje period. But of course there are much more places which I have not seen yet. Recently many foreigners visit Seoul but for many non-Asian foreigners the biggest attraction is a countryside, Buddhist temples, places that coloured with oriental beauty, not the contemporary midernity, although DDP is gourgeous as well.

And if I really have a chance to see him, I would be very proud and honored a bonus plus if it's in Korea because Korea is a very beautiful country with so many Catholic martyrs.  And that is such an inspiration too. Definitely I would love to see Haemieupseong Fortress, Haemi Martyrdom Holy Ground, Gaesimsa Temple or Solmoe Holy Ground.  Hope to see it with two good people I have missed travelling with Monica Manaloto Mendoza and Nori Amargo.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/wtf-review

Model: Symone Maria Oei ","Went once out of curiosity and never going again for multiple reasons.

Dogs are very food-motivated. So dont expect any of them to pay you much attention unless you are willing to fork out extra for a pack of treats to bribe them into giving you some affection. (No promise they'll give you much either. Given how often they get to chow down on them.)

Secondly, animals need time to grow accustomed to you. When I visited, a regular stepped in and immediately all the pups darted towards her.üôÅ All the other people there had no choice but to sit in the corner and sorta just watch from afar. Not pleasant. But nothing we could do about it either.

After one experience I figured it'd be much more worthwhile to volunteer at an animal shelter to interact with pups who desperately want and deserve love too. (And will likely much more willingly give you love.)

Having a dog myself, I know how much stress dogs can relieve and how affectionate they can be. Dogs are great. But dont exploit them.
Putting them in an environment like this spoils them to the core and will deteriorate their character in the long run.

Edit: Try visiting Mutts and Mittens instead.‚ò∫Ô∏è$$Basically u need to buy treats in order for the dog to stay by ur side for u to touch and interact... If not u will be just wasting money ($10.90 entrance fee) and time there looking at the dogs walking by... I rather go to my relatives and friends house to interact with their dogs (no treats needed) and relieve stress there...$$I don't like the idea of buying treats from the shop in order to attract the doggies. Too much treats are bad for dogs. And are the treats healthy? Eg, dehydrated treats, home made treats etc?$$Just go visit a dog shelter and donate food to the dogs that really need your love and attention. Crappy cafe that exploits animals sucks$$why support this kind of cafe who use animals to make money? There are many dog shelter whose dogs needed more love and attention. Also imagine these pedigree dogs are like clowns waiting to be stuffed with treats...you think it is healthy to be eating treats all the time?$$YueKit Kwan entrance fee is like $10.90/2hrs ($7.90/hr extra) and if you dont buy treats, the dog wont even let you pet them.
Treats itself aldy cost $3/pack and $9 for 4packs. Even if you go there many times, people who bought the treat will always get the dogs attention. So, buy it or leave it.$$The dogs there are not friendly , i almost got hurt when i trying to pet one , me and my boyfriend just go there waste our time and play some games they provided.... 

Ps: even dog shelters or SPCA dogs are friendly to let you pet........ this is shit.....they shld train the dogs more$$I went there once with my boyfriend, bought 2 packets of treats and the dogs still didn't  give a flying f* about us LOL. They took the treats, moved away when we tried to pet them and walked away once we stop feeding. üòÖ Not worth a visit in our opinion.....$$With or without treats it's
really hard to get the dogs to come to you. Lola is one dog that had bad experiences with strangers who just carry her without basic respect of being gentle. You gotta be some kind of God blessed dog whisperer to really have fun. I wasted my $25 though. The pinch is real.$$Went there once. Yes the dogs mostly give you attention if you have treats, but after awhile when they get sleepy they'll crawl into the first person's lap they see, and they pretty much stay there and snooze till you need to move your numbed legs$$Omg why the hate for this place. These are DOGS. They obviously will be treats motivated. Don't worry abt the dogs being overfed. The owners calculate the packs of treats at the end of the day and feed them accordingly. None of them are overweight despite this cafe being opened for years so yea obviously something is being done right.get the pups to do tricks for their food, they are super cute and smart. 

I go there often and I see people grabbing the tiny pups and forcing them to take selfies w them üôÑ do u think that these pups are going to be v fond of u?? Be gentle with them and naturally some of them will be drawn to u. I personally have no trouble luring one or two dogs to snooze/play w me (ps Lulu is a sweet heart ‚ù§Ô∏è) just be patient and visit more often hahaha. 

WTF if ur reading this, please please please come up w yearly membership price üòÇI would totes buy it ‚úåüèªÔ∏è$$The first and only time I visited, most of the dogs were being hogged by some visitors (sleeping on their laps for almost the entire time I was there). So you just end up looking at them and the few dogs left walking around who will mostly ignore you unless you have treats. Waste of money.$$Bad experience there after just one visit. Went there on my birthday but I was sorely disappointed because the dogs do not come to you unless the staff gives u some treats. Extremely boring. Expect to be sitting around looking at the dogs from afar if u do go. I'd much rather go to the local dog shelters where the dogs welcome anyone, regardless of treats.$$lol Prerna Wangnoo i just read the comments and i think u shld just come and meet my dog instead... i charge u half the entrance fee and don't even need treats my dog will fly to u!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bandhavgarh National Park, lying in the heart of the Vindhya Mountain Range in Central India, is a small and compact National Park, yet full of game. The density of the tiger population at Bandhavgarh is the highest known in India. 
The centre of the park is dominated by the majestic Bandhavgarh Fort built in the 14th century, around which are numerous caves containing shrines and ancient Sanskrit inscriptions. The park has four main entrances, Panpatha in the north, Tala in the east (most of the hotels are located in Tala), Dhamokar in the south-west and Khitauli in the west. Two roads, Umaria-Rewa highway and Parasi-Katni road via Khitauli pass through the park. Tala is a small village on the Umaria-Rewa state highway. 

The Original home of all the white tigers alive, today, Bandhavgarh was the hunting ground of the Maharajas of Rewa; their old fort still dominates a hill in the forest. These white tigers were found in the old state of Rewa for many years. The last known tiger was captured by Maharaja Martand Singh in 1951. The White Tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharaja of Rewa.

My name is MARVIS MARCEL from KENYA and I'm happily married to a lovely and caring

husband,with two kids.A very big problem occurred in my family seven months ago,between me and my husband.so terrible that he took the

case to court for a

divorce.he said that he never wanted to stay with me again,and that he didn't love me anymore.So he packed out of my house

and made me and

my children passed through several pain. I tried all my possible means to get her back,after much begging,but all to no avail.and he

confirmed it that he has made her decision,and he never wanted to see me again.

So on one evening,as i was coming back from work,i met an old friend of mine who asked of my husband.So i explained every thing to

her,so he told me that the only way i can get my husband back,is to visit a spell caster,because it has really worked for her too.So i never

believed in spell,but i had no other choice,than to follow her advice. Then he gave me the email address of the spell caster whom

he visited spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com So the next morning,i sent a mail to the address he gave to me,and the spell caster

assured me that i will get my husband back the next day.What an amazing statement!! I never believed,so he spoke with me,and told me

everything that i need to do. Then the next morning, So surprisingly, my husband who didn't call me for the past seven {7}months, gave

me a call to inform me that he was coming back.So Amazing!! So that was how he came back that same day,with lots of love and

joy,and he apologized for her mistake,and for the pain he caused me and my children. Then from that day,our relationship was now

stronger than how it were before,by the help of a spell caster.

So, i will advice you out there to kindly contact him through his email spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com if you are in any condition

Despite one income gone, my husband works very hard to give our family a comfortable lifestyle. In addition,  he helps me with the household chores, coaches the children in their studies and spends whatever time he as with the family. He gave up his only hobby (golfing) as he told me golfing took up a considerble amount of time and he rather spend his time with the family. 

He looks like a punctured tyre at the end of each day and my heart cannot help but cry when i see how tired he was. The fact that he did not utter a word of complaint made us appreciate him even more. He is a good husband, caring father and a filial son.

Hope to win and reward my hubby Edmund Joseph Tan for his hard work.$$For me, staycations meant taking time to smell the roses. It's a wonderful way to spend quality time together with my loved ones without the hassle of travelling overseas. And staycations truly revive our love for where we live!

Hoping to take this chance of a Staycay to recharge before the start of a hectic semester, and to explore the side of Singapore that we don't really go to.$$If I win I will make myself free to gather with my loved ones especially  with my precious mum. My mum is my superstar. She is always behind me no matter what I do. Never forgetting her unconditional love showered upon me, her relentless care and concern and intricate daily routine for the family.
My mum took charge of everything ranging from the household chores to taking care of the children. My heartpain whenever I see her dry and flaky hand due to constant soaking in detergent during washing. I came from a poor family. Life was excruciatingly hard and there was never a single day she was not struggling with small expenses. (just imagine the years of pain and hardships she encountered bringing us up since we were kids). The mental and physical burden weighing on her had never been lighter, but heavier as the list of expenses and expectations got more demanding as we grew older. Nevertheless I had never seen her fall sick, frown or complain dramatically over the intolerable level of hardship. She never once gave up nor chose to quit. She will ensure that we are well fed at the very bare minimum - which is what she always prioritize over everything.
She sacrifices to take care of us no matter how hard - such that everyone of us kids turned out well. She dotes on us more than anyone else in the world. Her advices are inspiring and enlightening. She led and taught us how to be good such that not a single of us siblings go astray in a poverty environment. I feel really heartpain and touched. She was frugal on herself but never hesitant to spend on her kids, esp on our education. I know she loves staycation but has refused to join me for that luxurious experience several times as she does not want to inflict that pinch on my financial pocket. I would like to repay her (get rid of some of her burden at the very bare minimum) and pamper her with this fabulous staycation - she really deserves such treat she needs, as she has sacrificed way too much for her kids. I cherish every moments with my mum for I know that time waits for no man and I do not want to miss any moment with her.

The winning of this magnificent staycation will be a very special treat, it will certainly bring happiness and a content smile on her face and laughter to my siblings as we enjoy the staycation together as a family. 

This splendid staycation will definitely be the most precious, meaningful, warming, enjoyable and memorable for everyone esp my lovely mum. Thanks for the awesome giveaway.
Hope to win and makes my dream come true!!$$Liked and shared! 

Hope to win for my deaf husband's coming birthday (November) as well as we married for 24 years. We had our honeymoon in Ramada Hotel in Gold Coast, Australia 23 years ago.

Since my son (first one) was born a year ago, me and my husband never had a time just for both of us, especially with a 1 bedroom house with my inlaw stay with us to take care of my son while both me and husband are working daily. I hope and I really wish i could win this staycation. It would be a dream come true for both me and my husband. Thank you!$$Done!!! My cousin's 2year old birthday was held there, and they bought a package for a staycation at Zhongshan park hotel, where there was a buffet spread the day after and allowed their guests (inc. my family ) to try out their amazing variety spread of buffet. The hotel was very picturesque , and furthermore I had also uploaded my ootd at the little lake/ pool as the background further point the contrast of my outfit. It's a nice tranquil place and I hope I can win this for my family and close friends to stay and chill there, over a peaceful atm, away from the hustle and bustle of sg$$Liked & Shared
This Staycation Giveaway is indeed something I really need. The past year as been a hard toll on kids and myself. I really need a break to just relax and clear my mind. Nevermind which one but will really appreciate this chance to get to cause I've never been on a staycation let alone a trip for myself....

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University‚Äôs Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don‚Äôt welcome science. They didn‚Äôt provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport‚Äôs History.
That‚Äôs Why I Couldn‚Äôt to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Ukai is a traditional method of catching small Japanese trout by manipulating seabirds called u (cormorants) in the Nagaragawa River, famous for its limpid stream, in Gifu Prefecture. Master trainers of cormorants dressed in ancient costume freely manipulate 10-12 wild sea cormorants to skillfully catch small trout. This fishing is performed every night between May 11th and October 15th except during a full moon or in heavy rain. You can watch the entire spectacle aboard a small wooden boat while dining and drinking sake!

Tell us your answers in the comments section, and keep sending us your stills, videos and blog posts for a shot at being featured. ","Para Sa Mga Nagdadalawang Isip Para Iboto Si Mayor Duterte please read this:

The attacks against Mayor Duterte is so intense. I've never seen such attacks against a frontrunner in the past 2 National Elections. With just few days left, these will even intensify. If you are a supporter and thinking of withdrawing your vote for Duterte because of his issues, brace yourselves and remember the reason why you supported Duterte in the first place. We've started from the bottom, now we're here. Change is coming. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future. This man has a huge sincere heart that I believe will benefit the country.

Maraming nagsasabi na ""if you want change, start in yourself at wag iasa sa magiging pangulo."" I agree, pero wag nating kaligtaan na marami ding mga tao na kahit kaya nilang simulan yung pagbabago sa sarili nila, kailangan padin nila ng isang tagapanguna na kaya silang tulungan na mangyari yung pagbabago na hindi lang sa sarili nila kundi sa kabuuan ng isang bansa. I believe that Duterte is the man.

Everytime he talks about his country and the change that he wants to bring, he is very sincere. Para siyang stand-up comedian bago magstart yung 2nd debate sa TV-5 (joking about Mar going to restroom and not knowing a single person from the audience), nakakatawa. He is known for his gutter language at offensive siya minsan. Sabi nga ng iba parang di siya nagiisip bago magsalita. But everytime he speaks about his love for the country and concern for his fellow Filipinos, he is very sincere. He has the most heartfelt messages. Sincerity makes the very least person to be of more value than the most talented ones.

He is also the candidate na hindi uhaw na uhaw na maging presidente. I believe it‚Äôs because his heart is really for the people and not for the position. He said many times that he will not die if he does not become a president. He said he will not apologize for who he is even if he lose the presidency.

While the other candidates in the last debate promoted themselves as the rightful president and expressed their confidence in winning the election, he simply said, ‚ÄúWala akong hangarin except for my country. And I pray to God that the nation will be enlightened with His Grace, and you can choose the leader, bahala na kayo kung sino, the one who can make it happen.‚Äù Did you see that? Tayo na daw bahala. Di niya tayo pinipilit o pinapakiusapan na siya ang iboto. Also notice, his desire is for the country and his prayer is not for the people to be enlightened by his track record, leadership and platform (though those were really good), but be enlightened by God‚Äôs grace. He did not rely on himself and his achievements, he entrusted everything in the Grace of God.

I don‚Äôt want to sound like a priest but I hope that the religious leaders noticed it too. Only Duterte and Miriam mentioned in their closing speech that they are praying to God for the welfare of this nation. You see? Si Mayor Duterte, palamura, womanizer daw, corrupt daw, murderer daw, in other words makasalanan. But he is seeking God‚Äôs grace in this endeavour.

I‚Äôd rather support this ‚Äúsinner‚Äù who depends on the grace of God than those religious leaders and self-righteous politicians who depend on themselves. I‚Äôd rather vote for someone na hindi ‚Äúdisente"" at hindi atat na manalo kaysa dun sa sumisigaw na siya ang mananalo. I will choose Duterte for his sincerity and desire to make sure that his fellowmen are safe and free from criminality, drugs, and corruption.

Sabi ng karamihan magdesisyon daw ayon sa character, moralidad, at kakayahan ng isang kandidato. Nope, ang desisyon ko ay base sa sinseridad at pagdepende ng kandidato sa biyaya ng Diyos. Because God‚Äôs grace can transform someone‚Äôs character and morality into better. But it cannot change a self-righteous person simply because they won‚Äôt even see the need for that Grace because they just depend on their own goodness.

Now, what if one day I realized that I supported the wrong person? Then be it. Life goes on. We just learn from it. In fact, we have been making bad decisions in electing Senators, VP and President in the past. Who knows this time, we‚Äôre making a good one. They say that a vote for Duterte is a high risk. Well, I'm taking the risk because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. I don‚Äôt really think that this 71 year old man would like to be remembered as a bad leader. I believe that he wants to leave a legacy that will change the course of this country.

It is apparent that there is a very strong opposition to stop the Davao City Mayor. But the greater the opposition, the greater the opportunity. An opportunity to stop the dominion of the elites and oligarchs. An opportunity to fight, suppress and stop drugs, crime and corruption. An opportunity to clean the government and the system. Change is coming. Lets DU it! Duterte for President!$$Amazingly captured by me in my hometown Gumaca,province of Quezon during my vacation..$$Nice shot  ...

Tubbataha Reef, Sulu Sea

What is it like? 
Tubbataha Reef is a natural marine park that's considered as the global center of marine biodiversity. UNESCO has declared it a World Heritage Site, and in 1999 the Ramsar Convention in Iran listed it as one of the ""wetlands of international importance."" Explorations in the area have revealed that the park has no less than 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 11 species of shark, 13 species of whale and dolphin and even 100 species of bird. It is also the nesting grounds of green sea turtles and critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles. CNN Travel named it as one of the best dive sites in the world.

Fun Fact: 
Tubbataha is isolated, and can only be visited on a liveboard boat. There are no settlements on the islets in the area. Divers who want to visit and have an unforgettable experience must book in advance.

So you pull up lists of programs on GoAbroad and browse through each listing, lookin...","I don't want to break the good vibes but this is just an observation. Some Pinoys act snobbish because they know English...lots of them students, professionals, celebrities...they are so proud that they can speak English that they almost ignored using their own languages...

We confined our native languages to farm life, poverty. But for 2nd languages like English and Tagalog (for non-Tagalogs) we use them when talking about pop, progress, industry, personal and social advancement.

We are killing the dignity and life of our own languages.$$Love my country üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ proud filipino!!$$All Filipino people are so nice!i!I ve been considering to move there because (look at the photo)$$Proud to be filipino$$Beautiful country friendly respectful people you are the best phillipines !!$$And the Pinoy men are hot$$Many Filipinos I know tell me I am the only Pinoy they know who speaks proudly and enthusiastically of the Philippines. They say, it is hot and humid; dirty and polluted; holdups, robberies, kidnapping, pickpockets, and corruption are pervasive everywhere. Why do you still speak proudly and enthusiastically of the Philippines? 

I respond, because of the Filipino people (proudly to be one of them!)! Because of our natural assets notably Vigan, rice terraces, Sagada, Mt. Ma(ga)yon, Palawan, Bohol, Cebu, CDO, also Baguio raisin bread, Albay's pinangat, Iriga's ginataang laing, Cebu's BBQ, just to name a few. And of course the positive changes such as Pinoys are now more health conscious (biking, running, hiking, and mountaineering) more concerned of the environment (recycling, trash clean-up, sanitation), and they are now intolerant of corruption. 

All these are evident in places where, if you don't know you're in the Philippines, you would think you're in nice European or US cities where it is safe to walk around, fun to window shop, definitely a gastronomical delightful to wine and dine, or experience a 4D-movie in a 4DX theater! Whoaa??? A 4DX theater in a Third World Country? There's not even one here in San Diego, CA! Positive and wonderful changes to the people and places compared to many decades ago. 

Why I speak proudly and enthusiastically of the Philippines? Do you have the time to listen?$$Yes, let's love our own naman! There are many positive things and blessings to be thankful for! Besides, as a matter of speech pattern--we truthfully can acknowledge 'those areas that need improvement=the negatives""...without sounding HOPELESS! There is always a ""way to solve problems/ improve the situation'--if only we sincerely put our minds and hearts to it!$$You only need one reason. I am in the Philippines right now and it's rainy season here in Palawan.....it's the people who are the most wonderful you could wish to meet ;) Right Aileen Turqueza?$$When I was still in the Philppines, I thought my country was bad enough to leave it behind. But then when I stayed and work here in the U.S for 5 yrs. I have a change of view and opinion about the Philippines and the U.S. You see I work here with one of the biggest retail store in America or maybe in whole world...I can't help myself to compare about the people here shopping and their behavior.  I've never seen such numbers of shoplifters here stealing everything from a 50 cent to 1000$ items. Some of the customers,if not all but Majority of them are so unruly and disrespectful, they open everything here even thightly sealed items and then just leave it behind in a mess. In short at the end of the day the store looked as if a twister have ran over it,total chaos. And this one makes me think that we behave more and we have more respect more than this people here. Saka sa maniwala kayo o sa hindi ang daming bobo dito! Moral lesson,don't you ever believed 100% in those hollywood movies that you watched about the way of living here, its not that true,it's totally different here in reality than in the movies. Some people here are too proud of themselves, they show too much superiority complex but when you closely look at it they were inferior. So people like me stays here for some reason but we don't forget who we are,100% Pinoy pa rin kami$$I am proud to be Filipino and I love my country, the beautiful Philippines!!!$$Many thanks Guys..hope you have a fabulous time in my beloved country--BEAUTIFUL PHILIPPINES...$$Beaches and forests not to be abused..$$Its more fun in the PHILIPPINES",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Tarsiers of course and spectacular fireflies but I also saw sunbirds and a Philippine hawk owl where this photo was taken on the hotel veranda <3$$Para Sa Mga Nagdadalawang Isip Para Iboto Si Mayor Duterte please read this:

The attacks against Mayor Duterte is so intense. I've never seen such attacks against a frontrunner in the past 2 National Elections. With just few days left, these will even intensify. If you are a supporter and thinking of withdrawing your vote for Duterte because of his issues, brace yourselves and remember the reason why you supported Duterte in the first place. We've started from the bottom, now we're here. Change is coming. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future. This man has a huge sincere heart that I believe will benefit the country.

Maraming nagsasabi na ""if you want change, start in yourself at wag iasa sa magiging pangulo."" I agree, pero wag nating kaligtaan na marami ding mga tao na kahit kaya nilang simulan yung pagbabago sa sarili nila, kailangan padin nila ng isang tagapanguna na kaya silang tulungan na mangyari yung pagbabago na hindi lang sa sarili nila kundi sa kabuuan ng isang bansa. I believe that Duterte is the man.

Everytime he talks about his country and the change that he wants to bring, he is very sincere. Para siyang stand-up comedian bago magstart yung 2nd debate sa TV-5 (joking about Mar going to restroom and not knowing a single person from the audience), nakakatawa. He is known for his gutter language at offensive siya minsan. Sabi nga ng iba parang di siya nagiisip bago magsalita. But everytime he speaks about his love for the country and concern for his fellow Filipinos, he is very sincere. He has the most heartfelt messages. Sincerity makes the very least person to be of more value than the most talented ones.

He is also the candidate na hindi uhaw na uhaw na maging presidente. I believe it‚Äôs because his heart is really for the people and not for the position. He said many times that he will not die if he does not become a president. He said he will not apologize for who he is even if he lose the presidency.

While the other candidates in the last debate promoted themselves as the rightful president and expressed their confidence in winning the election, he simply said, ‚ÄúWala akong hangarin except for my country. And I pray to God that the nation will be enlightened with His Grace, and you can choose the leader, bahala na kayo kung sino, the one who can make it happen.‚Äù Did you see that? Tayo na daw bahala. Di niya tayo pinipilit o pinapakiusapan na siya ang iboto. Also notice, his desire is for the country and his prayer is not for the people to be enlightened by his track record, leadership and platform (though those were really good), but be enlightened by God‚Äôs grace. He did not rely on himself and his achievements, he entrusted everything in the Grace of God.

I don‚Äôt want to sound like a priest but I hope that the religious leaders noticed it too. Only Duterte and Miriam mentioned in their closing speech that they are praying to God for the welfare of this nation. You see? Si Mayor Duterte, palamura, womanizer daw, corrupt daw, murderer daw, in other words makasalanan. But he is seeking God‚Äôs grace in this endeavour.

I‚Äôd rather support this ‚Äúsinner‚Äù who depends on the grace of God than those religious leaders and self-righteous politicians who depend on themselves. I‚Äôd rather vote for someone na hindi ‚Äúdisente"" at hindi atat na manalo kaysa dun sa sumisigaw na siya ang mananalo. I will choose Duterte for his sincerity and desire to make sure that his fellowmen are safe and free from criminality, drugs, and corruption.

Sabi ng karamihan magdesisyon daw ayon sa character, moralidad, at kakayahan ng isang kandidato. Nope, ang desisyon ko ay base sa sinseridad at pagdepende ng kandidato sa biyaya ng Diyos. Because God‚Äôs grace can transform someone‚Äôs character and morality into better. But it cannot change a self-righteous person simply because they won‚Äôt even see the need for that Grace because they just depend on their own goodness.

Now, what if one day I realized that I supported the wrong person? Then be it. Life goes on. We just learn from it. In fact, we have been making bad decisions in electing Senators, VP and President in the past. Who knows this time, we‚Äôre making a good one. They say that a vote for Duterte is a high risk. Well, I'm taking the risk because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. I don‚Äôt really think that this 71 year old man would like to be remembered as a bad leader. I believe that he wants to leave a legacy that will change the course of this country.

It is apparent that there is a very strong opposition to stop the Davao City Mayor. But the greater the opposition, the greater the opportunity. An opportunity to stop the dominion of the elites and oligarchs. An opportunity to fight, suppress and stop drugs, crime and corruption. An opportunity to clean the government and the system. Change is coming. Lets DU it! Duterte for President!$$Yesterday's river cruise at Loboc, Bohol. üòçüáµüá≠ EarLa Navarro$$Well known with its powdery white sandbar and crystal clear water.

ITS THE ""PHILIPPINES"" !!!!‚ò∫$$As a Canadian whose been to 40+ countries and the Philippines in 5x in 5 years, I have to agree. what makes Philippines amazing is its people; but Philippines natural wonders are breathtaking as well :)$$Oh and I hope to move there from England soon. Any Filipino ladies want to marry me so I can buy some land or a resort? Ha ha.$$I didn't have to travel to 30+ countries to figure out that the Philippines is the bestüòâ$$He mean that Phillippines  is the most beautiful over 30 countries he visited is becuz of the culture and the hospitality of co filipino's, most of all the mother nature$$It was written once the country is liked by GOD he will let whole world know about it, many more like him will mention so much adoration about Philippines until all will agree this country is heaven on earth. Not just our economy (property) cinderalla story, or our military advancement , or our people excellent work (BPO/medical care nurses most liked service, Engineers, Professional and many more) and our unparalleled warm attitude towards foreigeners. Even in competition GOD already shown many times in different categories oN how He favored us to win the 3 top post. Another story Arab country from Dubai company Kampac Oil Group believe its worth it to fund $15 billion worth for railway system Manila to Pangasinan as they knew our economy will grow 3 times more which will make us the leader in Asia that is excluding using our natural resources such natural gas worth $26.3 trillion in West Philippine Sea our rock formation China forcibly reclaimed now a man made island, our rich deposits like palladium the south if not same amount as Russia next to them. How about our unlimited hydrogen fuel in short what ever the world need we have it. Imagine if Philippines will have the access back to thousand tons of gold bars then the country will become superior. These are just small part of signs and wonders one by one taking shape revealing. The more we love GOD the more blessing will come to our shore. Only those who chooses to be blind will not see all this thing from happening simultaneously. GOD wants to show to the world Philippines will be the center of Faith, easy sample is the concerts audience is all facing center stage see our geographic location. If anyone still think NOT true be our guest as Philippines will start showcasing to the world.$$Thanks Alex Sherack for openly sharing your thoughts on how ""BEAUTIFUL"" our beloved Philippines is! You're absolutely right... Our country is the ""MOST BEAUTIFUL""... Walang katulad, walang kawangis!! God bless the Philippines.$$Indeed our country, the Philippines is beautiful! It's just sad to think that our government is making it less appealing to the world.$$Having travelled to most of the world, I only recently holidayed in the Philippines. I never felt more accepted and treated so well as I have in the Philippines. I have since recommended the Philippines to all my friends and I will be returning again this year.$$#ALBAY , indEed the tourism meccA of the #BICOL region...

Visit Albay, one of the boOming tourist sPots in the PhilipPines.... and seE how stunNing #MountMayon is......

Discover world's mOst perfect coNe volcAnO and be amaze... visit nOw... hahaha$$Yes our country the Philippines is one of best in the world and the DOT has done its part in promoting it plus the airline companies making it affordable for people especially the locals to see theses destinations. So let us all try our best to let the tourists feel our hospitality- Filipino style and let them all feel the goodness of Filipinos. There are still other destinations that need government support in development.$$I'm an Aussie happily married to a beautiful Filipina been many times and wanted to retire there but sadly what hurts the Philippines and turned me off was the total corruption of small time government officials who wanted their fees under the table before I could get me permanent citizenship including one of my wife's distant relative but the people "" The normal citizens "" of the Philippines are the magnets to go back I don't go to the tourist spots I love living the life of the locals in Ilagan Isabella also the pollution is a big turn off but slightly acceptable$$It's a good place to visit. Especially the islands outside Luzon. 

But if you wish to move here, live in the provinces. Metro Manila is sooo bad ... maybe except Makati or Bonifacio Global city.$$Really true because another German  which stay in our neighbour house is hook up to Philippines  until now. He love Philippines he say other countries are beautifull but Philippines is the best and I love chatting with him. I said to him we Filipinos do our best to satisfy our visitors in what ever that we can. So to all foreign people visit Philippines so you can experience our culture and we well show you our best.$$Agree. From Australia üëçüèª beautiful people. Down to earth and back to basics.
I love it. Just got back not 1 week ago after my second trip, and already working out when I will go again.$$Proud to be pinay... I recommend this place for those who want to discover some of the beautiful and crystal clear water at CEBU (MALAPASCUA & KALANGGAMAN ISLAND)üòä$$Try Baguio City and the rest of Benguet Province... Visit the MUMMIES of Bokod,  The Cave in Sagada, The Rice Terraces of Banaue... And a lot more. Don't worry about language because we understand english perfectly.$$really?.. perhaps by nature only, not the cities and towns, except Makati & Cebu perhaps, & Davao.. Thailand, Malaysia, & Indonesia have both natural beauty and beautiful cities & cultures & great foods, Philippines not so much. Philippines, good country, beautiful, but not more so than those i mentioned, in fact they offer much more.  :)  the Aussie must have not really traveled much or has low standards, unless he is just mentioning about nature/scenery. :D$$Myself 34 countries, it's  a matter of opinion of beauty but yeah a beautiful country and stunning beaches, friendly people, lots of cool activities to do etc. However Poor food compared to the rest of SEA, lack of culture sense because not Buddhist, no temples monks etc which is to the eye more beautiful than any churches, was there at Xmas and thought was a joke for a Christian country! Everyone sounds and acts American, takes hours and hours to do a such a short journey, just some thoughts$$Try to visit camotes island here in Cebu$$I agree 100% I love the Philippines. Every time I go I have a great and loving experience there.$$WOW yes imust completely agree with him !been coming here for more than nine times over the years and have settled down a bit in Puerto Princesa City ,must say besides Australia there is no other place that i would rather live in it has its own spledour and beauty in people and places, Its Beautiful!$$And I can say the most beautiful place I have been in Philippines was bukidnon second is laoag  but the best that I enjoy is tacloban a lot of resort we hang out.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one üòÇüòÇ damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london üòçüòç my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them.

My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy!

What if Koreans and foreigners want to travel here together?$$KTO, thank you for your work and all the information provided which makes it very easy to travel around.
As some people have said above the fact that there are some tours for ""only foreigners"" is not understood by many because many people would like to go with their Korean friends or significant other. I guess it is just made to give opportunities for tourists who come from abroad, but still I find it unfair that Koreans cannot attend the tours in Chinese, English or Japanese if they wish to while a foreigner who has lived in Korea for 20 years could go. So, maybe it would be better to say ""only for non-residents""? There could be also the case of foreigners with Korean nationality.... what should they do? For all these reasons I would rather prefer to see ""Tours in Chinese, English and Japanese language"" better than ""foreigners"" being the case that KTO is mainly targeted to potential visitors to Korea which makes some 6.9 billion foreigners around the world and leave the word ""foreigner"" a bit meaningless. Also not all foreigners speak those languages, so my parents, for example, speak only Spanish and if they come to Korea they don't mind joining any of the 4 tours be it in Korean or English because they don't understand anything :)
I find it very useful and hospitable that you offer services in foreign languages, but from my point of view having queues to buy tickets only for foreigners (as in Yongin Folk Village) or entrance for foreigners (in Busan fireworks festival) is a little bit bizarre and kind of unfair for Koreans... I haven't seen anything similar in any other country. It's good that you make an effort but let tourists just live the experience as comfortably or uncomfortably as Koreans~

Boracay, Aklan

How to Get There:

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan. 

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.

What is it like?
When packing your bags for Boracay Island, shoes should be the least of your concerns. You'll be walking barefoot on the powder-fine sand most of the time. And sitting on it. And getting massages on it. You'll form quite an attachment to Boracay sand. Just please don't take any of it home! Leave the beach for others to enjoy.

Fun Fact:
Come dusk, young boys and girls take to the beach to begin sculpting impressive pieces of sand art. For a small fee, they can even personalize the sand art for you!

If it was destroyed by a bomb during the war then all the posts would've been obliterated already, which was not the case. The city itself was not bombed, much less the wharf! The platform that makes up the runway of the wharf  was made of wood, which were either dismantled or have deteriorated through time.$$I used to go here when I was young, we would then look for ""batad"" and ""sisi"".

""THE LEGEND SATAY SINCE 1952 AT BANDUNG""
West Java. Indonesia

Sate Kambing Hadori can be regarded as a living legend in the culinary specialties of Bandung that still exist today. So do not be surprised if this sate echo has echoed to the entire city of Bandung, even outside the city. So famous, to the extent that there is an anecdote that later developed in the community Bandung that if there are people named Hadori it will be then referred to as a handyman satay. Sate Kambing Hadori certainly have not name any names, but typical culinary symbol and at the same time struggle to exist.

Sate kambing is part of the cuisine of Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. It is very popular in the country, especially in Java. Sate kambing is the Indonesian name for mutton satay, since it is made of goat meat. This food is made by roasting goat meat that has been mixed with seasoning. A set of Sate Kambing usually consists of the satay itself, complemented by a sauce made of soya sauce or peanut sauce. Some people eat it with rice while others prefer to eat it with traditional rice box named lontong or ketupat. In some areas sate kambing is sold together with another popular food named gule kambing (goat soup). Sate can also be made by other meat e.g. meat of buffalo, chicken, fish, and others.

Clearly, if a culinary tour in the city of Bandung, do not miss to stop by the Sate Hadori

Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and Sicogon Development Corporation (SIDECO) will launch Sicogon Island Tourism Estate development within the first half of 2016.

The ALI-SIDECO joint venture is expected to drive economic progress in Western Visayas and the entire region as it serves as a tourism hub for surrounding or nearby destinations like Gigantes, Bantayan and Concepcion islands.

The 1,100-hectare Sicogon Island will feature a balanced mix of developments, such as a resort town center, hotels and resorts, as well as commercial and residential establishments, supported by an on-site airstrip.  The ground breaking of the airport runway is scheduled for the second half of the year.

‚ÄúThe initial development will concentrate on building the airport and runway, to ensure accessibility to the island,‚Äù said Jose Emmanuel Jalandoni, ALI Senior vice president and group head of commercial business.  ‚ÄúThe 1.3-kilometer runway will allow immediate access from Manila and Cebu to the island development,‚Äù he added, saying further that test flights to Sicogon are being targeted for the first quarter of 2017.

The project is supported by public, private and community organizations, and government bodies alike because of the potential economic benefits it will bring to the region.  A framework agreement was signed by ALI, SIDECO, and the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk Association (FESIFFA) in 2014 to pave the way for the sustainable development of Sicogon Island.  The group has been assisting the local community through skills training and livelihood programs to make them active partners in the development.

‚ÄúWe strongly believe and hope that poverty alleviation will be achieved through tourism projects.  These will give us various job opportunities and help us improve farming and fishing methods,‚Äù said Raul Ramos, president of FESIFFA.

Jalandoni stressed that sustainability will be a main focus of the project.  Aside from allocating more than 50% of the development for open green space, ALI will also work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to continue stewardship of Sicogon‚Äôs forested area, and work on coastal protection and marine life rehabilitation in support of sustainable development.

‚ÄúMore than becoming a premier tourist destination and a tourism hub for the region, Sicogon is envisioned to provide inclusive growth and economic development through long-term recovery and livelihood programs, and job creation,‚Äù said Jalandoni.

ALI estimates that the Sicogon Island development will provide 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly with increased tourism, and approximately P1 billion in earnings for the community through business opportunities that will come from the retail and commercial establishments.

What is it like? 
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast).

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what‚Äôs around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to development in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into 
knowing existence.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We asked a former SIA girl, who told us how staff are ranked according to how many MCs they take.

https://mustsharenews.com/sia-mc-appraisals/","You never feel like the company looks out for you, not just in terms of MCs, but even in things like just basic protection of their staff. Remember the case where the SIA stewardess got slapped while on a flight by an upset wife? I remember the words of the SIA spokesperson; ""this is a personal matter, not a company matter"". She wouldn't even be on the damn plane if she wasn't WORKING FOR YOUR COMPANY, CAN?! How DARE you claim it's not a company matter when she's wearing the very uniform that made your company famous, working on one of your planes, talking to one of your passengers? I left after two years because there's no point destroying your body working for a company that will call you for a flight on midnight of the day your MC expires. Because sure, my illness will magically expire the second the clock strikes midnight, like I'm some kind of miracle healing Cinderella.$$Seriously I could never understand why people always chose to remain silent and are only willing to make noise and speak up when a human life is lost.

I find that most people can't work smart. We are born with choices. Its sad that people now value more about the stacks of cash in their bank accounts then their health. A life is so much more valuable.$$Aiyoooo pleassseeee~~ Do u all know that air crew gets 21 days Annual Leave and on the average about 100 off days a year. 

SIA rewards crew with a medical benefit of $300/year( or is it $200, I can't remember) for those who take extra care of their health and not fall sick. 

No one is forcing anyone to go on flight Sick. BUT there are really a lot of ""chao Geng"" crew out there who always conveniently falls sick on occasions like New Year eve, Christmas and especially when they are rostered for shitty low paying flights such as Sydney, Bombay for e.g. 

An employee can be damn good at her job, but if she lacks discipline and responsibility. Who can you blame. 

So the rest of those who works hard and make an effort to stay healthy to stay to their rosters are idiots is it? 

I am an ex crew who had taken numerous MCs, prolly falling into the mid ""chao geng"" category and I still qualified for promotion interview. 

P.S : I'm speaking up on behalf of the other flying crew who can't say no sh*t because the other crew members would aim them for speaking their mind. So yah, dun like what I say. Too bad.$$This is sooooo true and sooooo inhumane of a company to treat their employees. Also it has become a competition to see who score the highest based on MC rate. So unfair! How can your crew be happy working if the company doesn't care for their employees welfare!$$It's not just the flight crews I heard. Ground staff, in other subsidiaries like engineering also from what I heard from friends who work there. Apparently , in engineering , my Friend said if you took more than 7 days MC, you won't be eligible for the free staff air travel benefit for certain period of time. Not sure if really true but it's really sad if it is. That's why many afraid to take mc even if genuinely sick. Dunno why MOM so bo chap. How can staff benefit also be tied to how many mc u take. Not ethical at all.$$Boycott Sia! All passengers can get sick too due to the sick flight attendants whom FORCED to work.. the virus will spread faster in enclosed cabins ...$$Dun blame anyone!  Everything happened must has reason. 
Is she playful and dun take rest when itl's time to take a nap or rest? 
We must know "" How n When to discipline! ""$$It ain't just the flight crew, ya know?! Just sayin'...$$hmmm... what about the cabin crew members who take mc to avoid certain desirable flight routes?$$Not only SIA lah. This practise is like normal in SG companies. Why make it sound that only SIA is doing it. üò¨$$My friend who was a SQ stewardess quit for mostly that same reason, and she vouch this practice was widely enforced within SQ$$I used to work in a few local companies..they use staffs number of MC taken, to evaluate their appraisals.

Working a job and trying to cook meals for my family is a trying task. It can be tougher  to be a working mom especially when you have a tough job or work long hours. So canned sardines are my favorite quick meals after a long day.  Sardines are packed with nutrients of every kind, and the canned fish are actually even better than the fresh, because with canned sardines, you‚Äôre eating the whole fish including the bones that are soft enough to eat, providing a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats in one tasty can!  My daughter loves tomato  sardines with melted cheese and broccoli.  My husband loves chili sardines with rice/noodles.  For me,  I prefer deep fried sardines with eggs &  toast = sardines french toast!  The ways of cooking is endless.  üòÅüòÅüòÅ

A big thank you to everyone who participated, and to GEOX for sponsoring this giveaway. Head down to the nearest outlet for their ongoing sales this weekend!$$Liked, Shared and love to win $100 GEOX voucher! I had a first pair of GEOX years ago, it was so comfy, and i would love to win a new pair cos the old one was worn to bits :p I could see that a new pair of GEOX boots will keep me warm when i travel to cool climates!!! :)$$Subscribed, liked & shared! I always have trouble on what shoes shall I pack when I travel. Thanks to this post, I am sure going to get a Geox product regardless if I win the voucher or not. But with the voucher, it certainly allows the let me have more pairs!$$When creating a pair of shoes, it is often a struggle between form and function. Not many can strike that fine balance between form and function -- GEOX shoes stand out not only because they have mastered this balance, but they have upped the ante by adding comfort to its highest possible level. 

I have never owned a pair of GEOX before but I truly believe that GEOX lives up to its name as I have seen a pair of GEOX that has been with my friend for almost 10 years. I want to win this GEOX voucher so that I can have a chance to experience this kind of relationship with a shoe! And then influence another person to get GEOX! Thanks in advance for this opportunity!$$Subscribed, liked & shared. Nope, I'm not winning this for myself. I'd like to win this for my mother. She would be traveling to Japan next month and the climate there is said to be really cold. She has never seen snow in her 62 years of living and she intends to wear her track shoes there as she's a thrifty woman. Therefore I sincerely hope to win this voucher so that I can buy her a pair of winter boots to keep her feet warm when she travels to Japan next month. That's the least I could do as a daughter I suppose and not let her wear track shoes while walking in the snow (: happy 2016 to you guys anyway! Cheers*!$$I should win this because Chiang Mai is a lovely place and I'm singing its praises because I have been to this city, had memorable memories and would love to return again. With its breezy mountain weather, cheap food and many cultural places of interest. It's amazing and way better than Bangkok if you are more into the Arts and Cultural sort of person. I did participate in the festivals like Loi Krathong (floating the boat on water) and Lanna (floating lanterns), it's awe- inspiring. And I wish to return to experience the wonder sight of the Sakura blooming and check off my bucket list too!$$I would like to win this for a very special someone Samantha Lee. She is my fiancee. She likes to travel around the world with me. She can definitely have this pair of boots to walk the world with me. Really hope to win this for her.$$I have been travelling a lot and realised that having a good trusty pair of shoes for travel is very important. Many times I have to pack like a pair of sneakers, pumps, slippers etc into my luggage which takes up a lot of space and weight, not forgetting those bulky thick winter coats when travelling to cold countries. Geox is a trustable brand for its comfyness which is stylish, at the same time, to match with all types of outfits! With this pair of boots, I don't have to worry about packing so many shoes into my luggage anymore! Hope I can win this and own my first pair of Geox! üòäüôÜ$$I should win because I only wear GEOX's shoes after I have foot problems.  It's the only shoes that helps me walk like a normal person again!

I should win as I am a big fan of GEOX especially because of its  technological innovation and Italian style. Geox's footwear exemplifies this style and innovation, thanks to original designs and exceptional breathability. In Geox shoes and boots, a patented system consisting of a microporous membrane placed on top of a perforated rubber sole allows heat and humidity to escape from my feet, and keeps the shoes fresh and comfortable all day. :D Despite this enhanced breathability, many Geox shoes and boots remain waterproof and that's crucial living in Singapore where it can rain anytime anywhere! :)$$Liked & Shared!

Me and my friend got lost in seoul. We are both Filipinos and it was the first day of our vacation, so expect us to forget our way out of the subway. Haha. Yes, because of excitement we forgot to remember the station and the exit near our guesthouse. We got the last trip to seoul station that night and we walk back and forth to the exits to remember our way out until our feet and legs got very tired. We decided to go out of one station and ask someone for directions but no one can understand english well and also they didnt know where is our address(we also asked someone in the reception of a school and he told us that we are far from our address) We are in doubt of his direction because as far as i remember i actually said to my friend that we are not near yongsan station but seoul station on our first ride on the subway so i am really in doubt of what he said. But because we are hopeless that night we bought tickets to yongsan station just to get home. But our doubt is so big that we decided to go out again of the seoul station and find our way home. While walking on the streets my friend suddenly called someones attention, we asked him if he know our address (we show him our guesthouse reservation) and he responded that we are on seoul and our address is in yongsan that is very far from our current location. He started to find our way through google maps and showed us the distance and it is actually really far. We insisted that our address is near seoul station but we cannot remember where in seoul. He search again and again on google maps and we can feel that he dont believe us until he asked us if we trust him. I said of course we trust him (because he looks trust worthy and we are hopeless that time). So he asked us to follow him (yes, he really guide us to our guesthouse). Near our guesthouse i can feel the happiness (of course because we found our way home and we can now rest). We didnt know how to thank him. I asked him if there is something that we can do to thank him and he just said ""no, its pepero day tomorrow. Do you know pepero day?"" and i said ""yes"" and he lend us his box of krispy kreme and said ""this is for you, tomorrow is pepero day"" (i didnt remember everything that he said but it was like pepero day is a day of helping, sharing and love. At first i did not accept his krispy kreme because i am ashamed of him (he helped us find our way home and now giving us a box of donuts) because it is too much for us but he insisted so we end up accepting it. All we can say that time to him is thank you so much again and again. We are very thankful because he passed through us when we our hopeless. We dont need his donuts, his kindness is too much for us. His name is Tong Kwon. We are very thankful that we met him. :)$$Yes I love PAPERO....Next Autumn I m going to Korea...but my concern is #HALAL food.

There are also a lot of food choices to choose from and I look forward to my next visit soon! <3$$Liked and shared! What do Sheryl Tang and I like about Bugis? The fact that Bugis Junction and Bugis+ holds the memories of our very first date together! Bugis helped me score the goal! Be like Bugis. We love Bugis!
A Valentine's day date back here would be absolutely lovely! üòç$$What I love about Bugis Junction and Bugis+ is how much shopping options they can provide and don't let me get started on the foodie haven spread over the 2 malls! Plus having 2 cinemas is just great as it give us more choice and timing to suit us!!

How you make decisions affects how much you earn. Find out your score.","Article would have been more helpful to the readers if it provides career guidance for each personality type rather than stating which types earn the highest income.

Also, Warren Buffett is well-known for being a straight arrow.

Instead of forcing people to change their personalities, it is more helpful to provide suggestions on how each type can leverage on his strengths to earn a higher income.

The world is blessed by people with different skill sets and strengths, not those with the same.

See ya there...  ‚ùÅ‚óï ‚Äø ‚óï‚ùÅ ","Hi guys. Just a feedback. My family and I have been wanting to explore Trengganu and its beautiful islands for quite some time now. But honestly, we have shelved the idea as there is no direct flight to Kuala Trengganu from either Changi Airport or Senai. At present the flight to Trengganu via KLIA is a no brainer as its involves a stop-over and price-wise, fyi, it is cheaper for us to fly to Koh Samui or Phuket. On the other hand, we will not travel by bus as the journey is impossibly long for our kids. So while we want to support tourism in Malaysia, I think its about time for MAS, Firefly or Airasia do the right thing! I am hoping for a positive response as I do want to see more success in the tourism sector in East Malaysia which has lots of potential and is indeed an untapped market at present. Thanking you in advance.$$Dear Naharudin Shariff, thank you for your feedback.

Kanchipuram, the golden city of a thousand temples, was once the capital of the Pallava dynasty. It is considered one of the seven sacred cities of India; some of the best temples were built here during the reign of the Pallavas between the 6th and 7th centuries. Subsequently, Kanchipuram also served as an important city of the far-flung empires of the Chola and the Vijayanagara dynasties.

Later, these dynasties too contributed greatly in the temple building activity of this town. 
The city has also been, through the years, a great seat of learning and culture. Adi Sankaracharya established his episcopal seat (Kamakodipeedam) here. Sri Sankaracharya, Appar, Siruthonder and the great Buddhist Bikshu, Bodhidharma, once lived and worked here. Today, it is known not only for temples but also for its hand-woven, silk fabrics.

Those who stayed up till late did not get it because of your error and had to restart the app over and over again, and now someone else who just logged in manage to get away with the sale.... This is one scam!

Now how should I explain to my wife that her 10 years anniversary gift was just a scam?

Goodbye Expedia! Hello again Booking.com & Agoda!$$It's a scam.. Been trying since 12.00am till 12.45am but the error code is still the same.. Called Expedia but they said the 50 rooms r taken, n they can only book the room for me without the promo code.. Just a gimmick to get users to
Download their app..$$Tried 1 hr 6 mins and called expedia as well! Guess it's a scam. #thesmartlocal has some explaining to do first thing in the morning you reach office!$$For your own sake, you had better distance yourself from Expedia. This fiasco that Expedia has generated has angered hundreds including myself. From their lies and horrendous management, to their mishandling of the relaunch, they have disappointed, disgusted, and infuriated all of us. Be smart, the locals aren't happy.$$Read the T&C, it says coupon value: $255 off hotel booking (‚ÄúDiscount‚Äù). One night is $255 before tax/surcharge but when proceed to payment and keyed in the code, it says  ""sorry, but the average price per night doesn't meet the minimum for this voucher"". It doesn't work, what a waste of time. Just to con you to download Expedia.$$BE CAREFUL everyone! Expedia shamelessly charged the room to my credit card, and at a room rate 50% percent higher than what every hotel booking website is selling at. The hotel Duty Manager has confirmed that the hotel has received my booking as complimentary stay, no reason why Expedia should charge me. Countless attempts to call & email Expedia over the last 4 days, got no help. My top 3 reasons for you to stop using Expedia are: (1) Their Marketing, IT, Call Centre don't speak to each other. Serious disintegration of a company. (2) Call Centre (for SG) is based in New Delhi. I spoke to 4 different Indian call centre agents, they have no idea about promo, cannot solve my problem. (3) Unstable technology. Guys, don't leave your holiday plans to a company like Expedia whose technology could screw you up. When you need customer service support, you need to deal with problem solvers, not programmed robots. Any problems out of their programmed capabilities, good luck, you're on your own! #BoycottExpedia$$Doesn't work at all. On Sunday - Mon stays it's ""unknown error"" and for other days the voucher code cannot be used because minimum average price is not met. It's a scam to get the app download numbers up.$$I can find the hotel,can proceed  all the way till they voucher code give me problem."" Amount is insufficient for the promn..blah blah"" . Is there anyone who has succeeded in claiming? Lol$$Not working at all. Average price per night doesn't meet the min requirement, and yet t&c state only can book one night per user..... :($$Either this is an elaborate, and counter effective, marketing scam, or the programmers are just plain stupid. Don't exactly know which is worse.$$Sorry smartlocal for spamming here. I know it's not your fault. Felt so guilty for complaining and defaming about the flashsale event! üòêüòêüòê$$ok.. so it not only me having this problem and it a scam. going to uninstall ...i guess i still stick to Hotels.com$$We are sorry that this situation has happened. The problem occurred due to an unexpected glitch coupled with high traffic. It's not a situation we are happy about. We are sincerely sorry about this. We are working on a solution and will update you all again later this afternoon.$$I clicked at 12:01am on the dot and all that popped up was ""I didn't meet the minimum requirement""????? what the hell$$Tried a few option dates but couldn't use the code.

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one üòÇüòÇ damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london üòçüòç my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them.
