""Perhaps we should focus on what we have in common -- Singaporeans and Malaysians are united by a common love for food.""

Let's just appreciate each other's food okay!The long-standing debate has been reignited: Whose food is better, Malaysia's or Singapore's?

Some Malaysians online have said their food is better, and slammed a few classic Singapore dishes. This won't end well...

https://mustsharenews.com/malaysia-singapore-food/","So if Singapore's food is nicer, does that increase our GDP? So if Malaysia's food is nicer, do their citizens become richer? There are lots of bigger problems to worry about than to squabble over something stupid like whose food is nicer üôÑ$$I'm a half&half, both SG n MY food carries their own charisma.

Having said so, I never wan to order kway teow soup wen in SG. Too bland for me. But I can have kway teow soup in Penang everyday whenever I'm there. My last trip I even lug in 3 kg of kway teow from Penang wet market before my flight home to SG.$$It comes down to the fact that Malaysia gives you more bang for your buck. It can't be helped with their currency crashing past 3 to 1, they are just much better in value. Skill aside, for the same price, the portions are better, the materials used are better. We can't compete with the cheap ringgit nor should we really want to.$$Got nothing to do with money or the exchange rate. I'm Singaporean born and bred but having lived in Malaysia for 13 years, nothing compares to Malaysian food hands down.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/taylor-swift-fanAmongst the sea of Taylor Swift fans screaming her name and stretching their arms out, it's hard to stand out. Not anymore, though, with these 10 items!","Update: Congrats to Valerie Ng, Ang Zhi Xin, Mariah Sanchez, Keng Choon Lee and Jessie Yap! Each winner will walk away with a pair of Keds x Taylor Swift sneakers of their choice.

A big thank you to everyone who participated in this giveaway, and to Royal Sporting House for sponsoring this contest. Head over and get your own pair - you may just win tickets to Taylor Swift's 1989 World Tour!$$Most people love Taylor Swift for her music. I mean, who wouldn't? She is incredibly talented. She writes music that is basically the anthem of our lives.
But the thing I love most about Taylor is her character. She is genuine, caring, generous, and so many other things. She is an inspiration to us.
I wish to win a pair of Taylor Swift x Keds so I can share it with my sister Jean Monique Sanchez who has been so passionate in helping me and our family. She is our Taylor, our inspiration, our hero. l wanted a pair for myself, but it would mean more if I can give it to her because the greatest sister deserves the best pair of Keds.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§$$My youngest daughter is a faithful and loyal fan of Taylor Swift since young. She always listen to her music even when she's studying for her exams claiming that her idols voice can help her concentrate and keep her cool! Well I do believe her words based on her good academic results üëç Therefore if I can win Taylor Swift 's concert ticket or her endorsed merchandise for my daughter, I trust that she will certainly be joyful ‚ù§Ô∏è$$Guess the chances of me winning this is 0.001% but still, from a 16 year old girl wearing cowboy boots and sundresses singing for small crowds to a 25 year old woman playing for sold out stadiums, Taylor showed us nothing is impossible as long as you try and give your best. I've been a Taylor Swift fan for as long as I could remember. And just imagine wearing a pair of Keds to Taylor's concert! How dope would that be?? Taylor Swift has come so far and I couldn't be more proud. CHOOSE ME CHOOSE ME please :D$$It has been 6 years since I fell in love with Taylor Swift & her music. She means so much to me because her songs got me through all the happiest & worst days in school, and she taught me how to stay positive even when life throws setbacks your way ‚ù§Ô∏è I will really really love to own a pair of Keds because Taylor's Keds collection has always stood out with its unique and gorgeous designs and I've heard that it's super comfy too for everyday wear ‚ò∫Ô∏è It will definitely be an ideal pair of shoes for every diehard Swiftie :3$$Because Taylor Swift is AWESOME and she stands up for herself in the best way and I LOVE all her songs!
Also, because my birthday is on 9 September and to get a pair of keds x Taylor Swift shoes wld be the BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER <3$$I NEED to win a pair of Keds because I'm a Keds lover and on top of that, I've never missed Tay's concert since 2011!!! And, this is absolutely the best shoes to wear on November 8!!!
PS: All of my Keds shoes are in the Philippines so I really have to get this!!! üòÅüòÜ‚úåüèªÔ∏è$$I bought my first pair of Keds long long ago in Taiwan, before the brand was even brought in to Singapore! Love it since then. The design, the print, the comfort. :) Can't imagine what kind fabulous style Taylor swift would bring into Keds. Whatever it is, I think Taylor swift can pull any style off, and make them look good!$$I wanna win a pair of Keds because I love Taylor Swift since I was 12 years old.Haha.i really loved her music.my birthday wish for this year is want to see her in real person and will be on her Singapore 1989 world tour concert as well.see you!!!taylor swift!$$Because my friend is a die hard Taylor Swift fan and I want to win this for him! No homo$$Bcos i want to wear keds x taylor swift shoes to her concert. üòç$$I would love to win a pair of keds x taylor swift shoes bcoz I am a FAN if Taylor Swift and I'm PROUD to carry merchandise endorsed by her üòÉüòÉ

I also like keds products bcoz they are well known to offer comfy and warm wearing experience.... most of all, it's simply my STYLE  ‚ù§Ô∏è$$I love Taylor Swift, her music, her live concert, her endorsement merchandise and everything else that belongs to my idol‚ù§Ô∏è A pair of kegs x taylor swift shoes will definitely be my dearest birthday gift in my life!!!$$I would like to have a pair of Keds x Taylor Swift shoes because I'm a fan of  both! I love Taylor Swift and every song of hers, in fact will never get sick of any even after her songs have been replayed umpteen times. Didn't get a chance to get the tickets for her concert  though, so I really hope I can get something related to her at least. In addition, I've just signed up for an acoustic guitar course so it will be perfect and even more meaningful if I get to win a pair of this exclusive kicks. Oh, and I guess I don't have to explain why I love Keds, because everyone knows their designs are always so unique, pretty and most importantly, comfortable! ^_^$$I would go gaga if I would to win this as Taylor swift is the MOST AMAZING PERSON EVER. The songs she produces have genuinely never failed to disappoint her supporters, or even anyone, and this shows how talented and hardworking she is with the HUGE amount of supporters at the age of 25, shes just so amazing. Another reason why I love her is because she's tots kind and humble. Taylor's not like any other celebrity. She uses her fame to help fans from around the world with their personal problems, and also did a secret sessions at her place to fulfill the wish of her fans to meet her upfront and to interact with her despite her busy schedule. I'm also a huge fan of Keds! I have been using their White shoes for school and the quality + style is superb! I hope I'll win this, my friends will definitely be so JEALOUS of me. Thank you for hosting such an awesome giveaway! (Liked & shared! :)$$I wanna win a pair of keds x Taylor swift because I really wanted it & she inspire me to be someone bigger & better!$$I need the shoes to give to a friend of mine whom is a huge fan of Taylor swift like since forever! He would be soooooo touched when he has it!$$I want to win this pair of Keds Taylor Swift shoes as the moment i saw it at RSH, i really wanted to buy them. Especially the cream coloured ones! All of them had a special guitar pick tag and it was really unique and pretty. I've been a taylor swift fan since Secondary school and i hope i am able to wear these shoes out :)$$I don't really listen to Western music, but once, the radio was playing 'Teardrops on my Guitar' & boy, I was amazed by the unique voice behind the song..I did some research, and found out that it's Taylor Swift! Her music never fails to surprise, from country-style music when she first started, to pop music, Taylor's done it all..her never-say-die attitude was what attracted me to her music too, her perserverence towards her own style of music proofed herself right when she was top on both country charts & the Billboard chart, a feat considered for her young age...she's also able to express herself well through her songs, incorporating her life story and love lines through the marvellous renditions. 
A straight-talker, though she may have personality clashes with some artistes, but that's what I like her for-her freestyle & true spirit, which explains why she has forged great relationships like Ed Sheeran, Selena Gomez & Lorde...

All in all, she's one great & talented young diva fans like me look up to..

Hope to win the shoes & be able to wear it to her concert proudly and shout 'I'm a Swiftie' with fans alike! Hmm maybe try for a chance to get her autograph there too?$$Because Taylor Swift is awesome and I love her! <3 Taylor Swift is love Taylor Swift is life <3$$Because I have never been to a concert before and I admire Taylor Swift's attitude towards music.$$Back in secondary school when I was ""Fifteen"", all the cool kids wear Keds. Either I wasn't cool enough or just poor :-P so I had those $10 white running shoes from the Pasar Malam :-) But I wore them with pride (because they are the only pair I got). Like Taylor Swift's song ""Never Grow Up"", I guess I never grew up and let this experience down. My ""Love Story"" with Keds has not ended yet because Keds, ""You Belong With Me"" :-) I hope I have the ""Last Kiss"" and ""Walk Out of the Woods"" with a new pair of Keds x Taylor Swift from Royal Sporting House Singapore and TheSmartLocal.com. Liked both pages and liked and shared this post. Kristina Ong Dee Kacey Daisy Marian Wong$$Taylor Swift is such a huge role model to me. I love how she loves and appreciates her fans. She has such a big heart  and has donated to charities and visited sick children in hospitals despite her busy schedule. I really admire her when she sings as she puts her heart and soul in her songs. She inspires me through her songs in many ways. Taylor tells stories in songs that I can relate to. It's like flipping through my diary and every single one of her songs has so much meaning to me. Her music totally describes how I feel. Her music has gotten me through my darkest times. She has even inspired me to learn the guitar. It's amazing how I can connect my feelings through her music . I am always inspired by her style when I dress up everyday. I absolutely love her girly sense of style and her line of keds shoes reflects that. Wearing the pair of keds, I can walk on this journey with her. With the keds shoes, I would be able to walk closely with her. It will also serve as a reminder for me to always push through obstacles and chase after my dreams. If I could borrow her style and wear it everyday, I would be overjoyed to the moon and back. It would mean the world to me if I could wear her line of keds shoes everyday. <3$$It would be so awesome and coooool if im able to win Taylor Swift x Keds shoes as i've always want to own a pair of my own.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Every 9th of January, the life-sized figure of Christ is brought out of the Quiapo Church to the Quirino Grandstand and from there, it's carried through town back to the Church by barefooted devotees yelling ""Viva Se√±or"" while a huge crowd attempts to touch the statue.

An annual event that started back in 09 January 1787, the Traslacion, as it is commonly called, has become a sacred devotion for many Filipinos around the country, such that the entire procession could last for almost 24 hours.

The longest traslaci√≥n was recorded in 2012 which lasted 22 hours. In recent years, the procession has captured the attention of the international media for being one of the largest religious gatherings in the world.

VIVA SENYOR NAZARENO!$$It's not about da image,is about a faith on there heart.pic show how Filipinos having strong faith to God Jesus$$Yung sinasabe na imahen or idol ang sinasamba namen mga Katoliko. Tanong ko lang? Bakit tinayo ang bantayog ni Rizal sa Luneta? Simple answer: to commemorate his act of heroism and for what he did for this country. Bakit tayo may imahe ng Poong Itim na Nazareno? To commemorate the suffering of Christ before He was nailed on the cross. Yung imahe nya na nagsusuffer, parang nakakarelate ang mga ordinaryong Pilipino na naghihirap, na manalig lang sa Diyos at giginhawa ang buhay nila. Kahit hindi pa nila nakakamtaman yung maginhawang buhay mas lalo tumitindi ang pananampalataya nila sa Panginoon. Please respect our faith as we respect yours. The Fiest of the Black Nazarene is way of showing what faith can do to ordinary people like me and every devotee of the "" Itim na Nazareno "".$$Lord look not on their failure to serve you right,but forgive them & shows the right way to worship you in spirit & in truth$$Images and names of Jesus are all representations of many remarkable stages of HIS life. And so are the images and names of Mary and the saints. All created to remind us all of something important in line with the bible. Faith is what drives people to touch and kiss them. I am a Catholic, i used to when I was a kid. I realized, people who kiss and touch these images are driven by faith (either to ask for something and to express gratitude), which Priests and Bishops have no control of. I believe, we all have different means and ways of expressing our faith. No one can say which one is right or wrong. Only God can judge us all.

And i dont ask people to believe me or any of us. We and all the followers of the other religions are being judged, anyway. But keep in mind, we all have our own ways and rights practicing our faith. 

If one speaks on behalf of the bible then he she it they must exhibit that respect learnt from it.$$God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.  How can an idol or graven image create heaven and earth.  Graven image has ear but can not hear. Has eyes but can not see has lips but can not speak has feet but can not walk. True God is mighty, creator  of the universe , mountains bow down and the sea will roar at the sound of His name. Jesus Christ the second God of the Trinity.$$Rather than to judge the Nazarene devotees (and the Roman Catholic Church as a whole), it is better to know and understand the story and heart of each person. Know the facts, ask the devotees themselves, try to put yourselves in their shoes first.

His Eminence Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle shared wonderful insights regarding this. Please take time to read. God bless us all! 

http://www.cbcpnews.com/cbcpnews/?p=70617$$WILD and MISTAKEN ANALOGY.

I was surprised to see on my newsfeed two pictures. Picture of the golden calf being worshipped by the Israelites with a caption ‚ÄúNOON‚Äù. The other is a picture of the itim na Poong Nazareno being carried and held in procession by the devotees with a caption ‚ÄúNGAYON‚Äù.

While the one who posted it was giving a caution that the devotees of today or even the Catholic Church herself of committing the same mistake of worshipping an idol, it does try to make an analogy, i.e. they denote the same context. The innocent, ignorant, and uncritical viewer might make a quick conclusion and like, share, and make a comment of approval on it.

Regarding that post, I offer these nuances;

1. We, Catholics, had always been proclaiming that we do not worship images. When we use images, we satisfy our human need to see and to feel our God and saints by representing them. There is no way we will entrust our life and salvation to a piece of wood or any man made images.
2. While our actions maybe misinterpreted, what counts are what we stand for. The homily of His Eminence Cardinal Tagle in the fiesta mass early this morning responds partly to this. The dire need of the devotees make them commit some acts which maybe bordering or even tantamount to idolatry yet, deep inside, it is actually faith of a different approach but deep and meaningful anyway.
3. There is a lot of and great difference between the golden calf and the image of the Black Nazarene who is Jesus Christ Himself. The golden calf was a pagan representation while the Black Nazarene is our representation of Jesus, the Second Person of the Trinity, our Messiah. The devotion is drawn not by the image itself but the one being represented by the image. Can those devotees still worship without the image? The answer is that it maybe difficult but they still can. But why make it difficult when it can be made easier by those representation images?
4. The dynamics of the use of symbols and signs in worship come to mind. As human beings, we live with signs and symbols. We cannot live without them. The caution is to focus on the meaning of symbols and the messages of the signs. The bible is a symbol of the compilation of the Word of God. The letters and the words in the bible are signs (images) of the messages. Thus, those religions who claim that they do not use ‚Äúimages‚Äù are either telling a lie or are being deceived. To worship the bible as a book and not its content and messages is also bordering on idolatry. Remember, the Word of God came before the ‚Äúbible‚Äù that we have now. Even without the ‚Äúbible‚Äù, the Word of God still exists.

We were cautioned by that post. I throw the same caution in easily accepting or being misled by it.

Happy feast of the Black Nazarene!
(Just saying.)$$If you have the faith... No need to have pictures or images... A prayer alone is enough to remember the Christ the Saviour...$$This is your society on religion. 

If a hundred people were regularly injured at an annual rock concert, that annual rock concert would be investigated and shut down. But somehow we've come to accept and expect that a hundred people are injured consistently every year at a religious event. On many years, a number of people are even trampled to death. We would even be surprised if this year there were no deaths. Are you on drugs or something? I'm not.$$Black Nazarene is not worship as God. He is like an idol for others to follow the way he was been. An example of true believer of God.$$black nazarene help my whole family far from danger and mostly to have a good health especially me.This i ask in the name of our lord jesus christ amen.$$I will make this post for the information and the benefit of some Catholic. In Exodus 20, God made a covenant with Moses, explaining all the Ten Commandments. Now these stabbers rely on that from the Old Testament of the Prophets. These stabbers are like those meddling Hebrew teachers who scrutinized Jesus because of His teaching. They all ask questions trying to see the errors of His teaching but they failed. When Jesus started preaching, He enlighten this teachers including questions about marriage and the sabbath day. Now which teaching do you prefer, the Prophets or Jesus.? From Ten Commandments, Jesus made it two. So change was evident in the New Testament. Now why rely on the old scriptures? Jesus said ""I am the Light, the Way, the Truth and the Life, none can pass to the Father without passing through Me."" He also said, ""Though they have eyes, they will not see; though they have ears, they will not hear."" Now he is the blind and the deaf? May you be enlightened.$$Exodus 20:4-5. 4. Thou shalt not Make unto thee any graven Images, or  any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water. 5.  You shall not worship them or serve them, for I, the LORD your GOD. am a Jealous God,  visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me.$$Isaiah 44:9-12 all who makes idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame. Who shapes a god and cast an idol, which can profit nothing? People who do that will be put to shame; such craftsmen are only human beings. Let them all come together and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror amd shame. The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint.

Habakkuk 2:18 of what value is an idol carved by craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one  who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.

John 4:24 God is spirit, and his worshipper must worship in the Spirit and in truth.

Would rather obey God or your religion?

Acts 5:29
29    Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.

God invented and man invented religion.

Christianity is not a religion. Christians must choose between obeying religion or obeying God's law or commandments.$$I'm a catholic and I respect other people's beliefs. But saying that we need saints and mother mary as channel for our prayer to reach God, I guess we don't understand faith that much. God is all around us, with us, closer than we can imagine, 24/7. All we need is to simply talk to him directly thru a prayer. That's it. The problem with most of us Catholics is that WE RARELY READ THE BIBLE. We just believe what others tell us about religion and christianity. If we read the Bible, we'd think twice about going to religious processions such as this. When was the last time you read the bible? üòÉ$$One last post. Catholic does not worship or idolize the statues and images you thought they have worshiped. The image or the statue is a representation or the reflection of the life of Christ or any other Saints, their passion or sacrifice. Something a lot of you would not understand. If you do not believe in the image of Jesus it is a blank space, nothing really, only a void. We were not born when Jesus walked among man, so when you pray how would you imagine Him? In the presence of the image you can figure Jesus passion and sacrifice. It is like this, If you did not believe in the Crucifix, then you did not believe in the sacrifice of Jesus and salvation. Upon the cross, His sinless body laid, he died carrying the weight of all the sinners, to save us all. Upon the cross, our selves are deemed by His sacrifice, a sacrifice for our Salvation. Our faith binds us directly to Him, and by the image/statue/crucifix or cross, we can clearly see Jesus, strengthening our prayer because as we close our eyes, we can see Him and feel His presence. I hope that was clear. The Black Nazarene is a representation of Jesus' passion, imagine Jesus in flesh walking, carrying His cross with all those people reaching out for him.$$Be Safe there!! Hope it'll be Peaceful and successful celebration. May the peace and glory shall cover the world :) #BlackNazarene$$""No one including religious sectors is PERFECT!"" This is a free country same as the Philippines. Everyone has the right to choose what type of belief practices they chose to follow. Bless those who believe in the goodness and power of the Lord, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit!üôèüëè$$Most of these stabbers focus on one text only from the Exodus, from the Old Testament, now Jesus came and His disciples compiled His teaching, on the New Covenant. Now how about this, we do ours do your. Have a little respect, respect our way because we didn't critcize your ways. Now if you don't respect us then do you think you have for yourself? Love the people around you and you'll recieve too. God's way is too complex none of us can reach, so for what He had installed for us, we'll never know. So live your own way. He knows everything, we don't. For whatever we do, judgement is always fair in the arms of the Saviour.$$Really incredible!!!
That's how Filipinos and many foreigners too fanatically join in venerating and processing this Black Nazarene .$$Please respect their faith,if you're not believing in image (statue) or if you are non catholic .You should give respect to catholic faith. Catholic believers not asking anybody to believe in statue or give you rosary or to invite you in the holy mass. So let the people pray and believe in any religion. #RESPECT #RESPECT #RESPECT$$For all of you who had bashed the Catholics. Here's something you might want to read to give you view of what we do. How our prayers are carried by Saints. Heres an example from the Virgin Mary. Here everything is explained and don't tell me Google texts are lies, well not all. And if you have more doubts, ask Vatican. http://www.theholyrosary.org/fatimaapparitions$$I was born and raised in Angeles city , Philippines till I left for Canada in 1974. We have a small church close to our house and there is the chapel call visitang Apu, there is our Black Nazareno lying there since the world war 2. People all over come and visit specially Fridays. As far as I can recall ,other Catholic Churches attempted to move the Black Nazareno but unable to. Now this church became a Shrine. All the remarks I have read so far make sense. Spirituality is a choice. Believe in faith or not.$$We respect your traditions and beliefs that's why for years, we are not complaining about it but when we gather in edsa to fight for our faith, most of you branded us as nuisance.may you have a peaceful and ZERO casualty celebration.

Oftentimes, visitors get trapped in malls or in the four walls of their hotels and go home missing the real Cebu experience. The beauty of Cebu is far beyond what Cebu City is. The pristine beaches are a bus-ride away and some require crossing the seas to nearby islands. The luxury resorts in Metro Cebu may offer comfort but adventure is beyond the city. I think this is what makes Cebu an all-around island. It caters to any type of traveler - shiny malls for shopping, a vibrant night life for any type of party-goer, high-end resorts for those who have more to spend for picturesque selfies, highland adventure for those who want to take risks, crystal clear waters for the beach bums, spiritual journey to those who need some boost of faith, challenging mountains to conquer, a diverse marine life and more than anything a people ready to welcome any type of traveler from the world all over. All these in one island set Cebu apart from the rest.

To anyone visiting Cebu, get out of your hotel. Walk the city streets. Take the bus to its quaint towns. After all, Cebu isnt just a city. It's one hell of an island.$$Dont miss this 10 tourist spots in cebu too!

Please stop by and share some ""Do's and Dont's"" or any other tips for a solo traveler visiting Seoul for the first time. ^^ ","Careful when you are walking near any train stations during the rush hour, Seoulites are really fast on their feet and they stop for nothing! Not even a beg your pardon or sorry! Nothing negative, its just the way they are. :)$$With over 12 million residents, Seoul is a non-stop, fast-paced metropolitan area. Visitors are often surprised at the sights, sounds and energy that make this hustle and bustle city so special!$$Also, don't expect too many ready smiles. Its quite normal for Seoulites to look indifferent but then again, they do't mean any bad, its just the way things are. Once you know them they are real friendly and now that I'm not there, I miss my Korean friends terribly.$$Best currencies to carry with you for exchange  is the USD cos when I tried with my country's as well the sterling pound, the former was totally not accepted while the latter had only a few main banks that would exchange it.$$Im thinking in travelling with Euros. I hope it will be no problem to exchange...$$I hope that I visit Korea in the winter

Here's something different for our readers. In Singapore, most of us go through our lives like drones, getting all our ""skills"" from textbooks. But we never pay attention to the skills that will truly help us in life. The ones that matter. Like making new friends, building relationships and pushing ourselves off that ledge of comfort that we desperately cling on to. We fear the unknown and unfamiliar.

So where do you start? That's why we decided to write this guide.

Go out there and start talking to people. Rake up some smiles, meet your new business partner, talk to that cute boy/girl in line, find out about a cool new bar and so much more. Remember the next time you hesitate about talking to someone interesting, you could be missing out on a whole lot of life.

Verdict:
While the food is nothing to rave about, it‚Äôs passable considering people generally visit character cafes for the ambience and aesthetic, rather than to indulge in a gastronomic experience. We fell in love with the beautiful decor and how its open 24 hours a day. Imagine bringing your partner here for a surprise midnight tea date! 

Hello Kitty Orchid Garden succeeds in creating a unique experience for all Hello Kitty fans, both local or overseas.

Tubbataha Reef is the mecca of Philippine diving, and a superstar in the international diving scene. It's accessible only by live-aboard dive boats between the months of March and June. You have the chance to marvel at 11 species of sharks, over 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 12 kinds of whales and dolphins, and get this ‚Äî 10,000 hectares of reefs.

How to get there:

Fun Fact:
Aside from being a marine sanctuary, Tubbataha is also renowned for being a bird sanctuary. A lighthouse islet, at the southern tip of the South Atoll, supports a large number of seabirds which nest there.

https://www.facebook.com/travelimagez/videos/vb.195718967444442/255967028086302/?type=2&theaterTime lapse scene of the milky way behind Guyam island, Siargao, Philippines. 

Guyam is a small deserted island of the coast of Siargao near General Luna. The island is visited daily by visitors on a boattrip or who come to just chill out for a while. It's a perfect little island with no facilities exept a toilet and 2 shelters. For a small fee the owner will allow people to stay on the island overnight. I've been in Siargao for over 2 months, the vibe of the island and the beauty of the surrounding islands make Siargao and incredible and addicting island. For a while have I been planning the right time to visit this island during the time when the milky way would be visible √°nd when there would be no light pollution of the moon, also trying to lucky with clear weather. 

The milky is not visible like this with your own eyes, it is because of long exposure shots (20 seconds) that details of the milky way become visible and with postprocessing details and contrast are further enhanced. The settings used are ISO 1600, f2.8, shutterspeed of 20seconds. I used a D800 and 14-24mm lens, but any DSLR can capture this and even a good compact camera with RAW abilities.

Check out his HONEST review of his visit to some of the Philippines' top destinations, including Bohol, Cebu, Palawan, and Siquijor, through this Vlog and we hope you too get to experience how MORE FUN it is in the Philippines!

P.S. Just some minor corrections and suggestions:

(1) On the duration of tourist visa:
a foreign traveller can actually stay in the Philippines visa-free for 30 days and not 21 days, as stated in the video.

(2) The whole of Mindanao is not unsafe and there are equally beautiful touristic destinations one could visit in there such as Siargao, which is becoming a world surf haven; Cagayan de Oro, known for the wild river rafting; Davao, where the Philippines' highest peak, Mt. Apo, could be trekked; Camiguin, where you could swim in a carbonated water, and many more! :-)

Singlish is a totally separate language system from English. It is neither an ""accented"" English, ""lazy/broken"" English, nor a ""dialect"".

A language system is not only defined by its vocabulary but also its pragmatics and universal grammaticular and audinal rules, which Singlish satisfies.

If you don't believe what I'm saying, I recommend you to read up some thesis publications especially in ""Language and Development"" regarding the establishment of Singlish as an entire new language system, which has since gained steam post 2008s as the progress and knowledge of human language development blossomed. Some of these were written and taught by multiple professors when I was in NUS, and they (foreign lecturers) were behind the stand that Singlish was innately a language, not a dialect.

Having established this, it is only natural if a foreigner is unable to understand us whilst in Singapore, the same way I wouldn't understand Tagalog if I were in Philippines or any other country, simply because it is another LANGUAGE, not a corruption of English.

I truly feel that Singaporeans need to take ownership of our beloved native language and enjoy its usage to the maximum. Do not be ashamed of it and do not let anyone make you feel that Singlish is inferior to English because it is not.

An Appeal to the United Nations from a former Filipino Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly

I am Michael Francis Acebedo Lopez, a Filipino and a former delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. Nearly ten years before the questionable rise of one Leni Robredo to the Philippine Vice Presidency, I had the honor of representing my country, the Philippines, as the youngest Filipino delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in its history. I also had the opportunity to be the Philippines‚Äôs first actual Youth Representative or Delegate, a partial fulfillment of our commitment to the UN‚Äôs World Programme of Action for Youth or WPAY. 

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accepted my letter of credential signed by the Philippine Foreign Minister. There it was stated that I was attending the General Assembly ‚Äúas Adviser to the Third Committee Plenary Session on Social Development, including questions relating to the World Social Situation and to Youth, Ageing, Disabled Persons and the Family.‚Äù In the august halls of the UN World Headquarters in New York, I also had the honor to draft and deliver the Philippine Statement to the General Assembly‚Äôs Third Committee. 

In light of Vice President Robredo‚Äôs video message to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs posted on TIME Magazine‚Äôs website and shared by various media organizations, I am recalling the mandate I was once given in an effort to reach out to all of you, member states of the UN and all organizations within the UN System. If said mandate is not sufficient because it has long since lapsed, I am hinging my appeal therefore on my being a natural born citizen of one of only four Asian nations who signed the 1945 Charter that created the United Nations. 

I am making this urgent appeal on behalf of each and every Filipino grossly misrepresented by our a Vice President in said video message, a Vice President whose own mandate has been called into question, with the highest electoral tribunal of the land, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, having considered the election protest against her win to be sufficient in both form and substance. 

With unfounded claims and unsubstantiated allegations, Vice President Robredo wantonly painted an impossibly grim image of the Philippine situation if only to attract international attention and action. To say that she delved in speculation is understating the gravity of her made-up claims and the severity of the damage she has caused on our country and our people in so doing. In reporting to the world what she failed to report to Philippine authorities, assuming there are actual reports received by the Office of the Vice President, she has not only embarrassed our country, she has betrayed the public trust and committed economic sabotage, both punishable under Philippine laws. 

For her to say that ‚Äúour people feel both hopeless and helpless‚Äù is a brazen lie. Confidence in the presidency is at an all time high (while the same cannot be said of the vice president whose approval ratings continue to plummet); as a people, we feel hopeful and empowered like we‚Äôve never felt before. 

Please understand that at the heart of this is destructive party politics. It is the Vice President‚Äôs party flexing its muscles to overthrow a duly elected government so they may once more regain control of government. Perhaps she feels time is running out for her because of developments in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal. So she and her allies have launched an expensive campaign using human rights and the War on Drugs as their excuse to bait the world into interfering in our domestic issues. 

When the Vice President says 7,000 people have been killed in the President‚Äôs War on Drugs, she fails to mention that this is set against the backdrop of around 700,000 to one million successful arrests and surrenders. So the figure she presents to you is not even one percent. And surely with the sheer number of those involved in the illicit drug trade, some police operations see suspects resisting arrest and fighting back and the police having to defend themselves resulting in casualties. Every war has casualties. It is not a perfect war and I‚Äôm certain there have been abuses along the way, and these need to be looked into and those responsible must be brought to justice. But exaggerating things does not help at all. 

In asking for the international community, the UN, to intervene, she uses the issue of human rights. Let us then talk about human rights. 

In responding to the call of Robredo, the international community must tread carefully lest it encroaches on our very sovereignty and our right to self-determination. And as a sovereign state, we have determined to wage an internal war (not a war against another nation) against the evils of drugs, a direction affirmed by our democratic processes when President Duterte who included the War on Drugs as one of his main programs of action, received an overwhelming mandate during the May 2016 Presidential Election. In short, the War on Drugs, by extension, has the people‚Äôs mandate. 

Any effort to disturb our democracy and sovereignty as a response to the Vice President‚Äôs irresponsible and unfounded claims will subvert the will of the Filipino people and violate our Human Right of Suffrage enshrined in both the Philippine Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 21 of the international covenant). 

Once again, I am making this appeal to all member states of the United Nations and all organizations within the UN System to disregard the Philippine Vice President‚Äôs statement which is, I reiterate, a grave misrepresentation of the prevailing sentiments of our people and a gross perversion of the facts surrounding the War on Drugs. 

To my fellow Filipinos, let us remain vigilant in the face of threats to our democracy by the very people who claim to defend it. Ako po‚Äôy nanawagan na i-share ang video na ito upang ito ay umabot sa UN at sa iba‚Äôt ibang foreign governments. 

Maraming salamat. Thank you and good evening.

Plus, I have always wanted a beach blanket that doesnt have sand stuck on it! That way, I wont have to be shaking or swiping sand off my body when I leave the beach. :D$$Because I want my happy friends to get stunned like vegetable at every moment!

I asked‚Ä¶","I spend more than that on San Mig lites...a day! Have more fun in the Philippines$$we don't need to spend so much to be able to experience the best thing in life.$$Must of been severely de-hydrated, very hungry, lucky to find transport and not scammed$$It takes common sense to not waste as much money on things that aren't needed.$$I miss myself seeing there$$It is depend where (location or country) you arrange your vacation (transaction because currency is different)...  the last time I went to visit to Philippines my sisters purchased my round trip ticket. ( I do not have NO MORE excuses not to visit them... I was glad I was in a little recovery, I did my travelled alone and shared my story to my ONLY TWO sisters I was divorced... I did not see my eldest sister and brother at that time because I still tried to AVOID any question... because I do not want them to feel bad or give them any worry) the ticket was cheaper to compare IF I purchase or did transaction in USA. ( more money)..............  Long time ago my husband and I arrange our hotel somewhere in Philippines (Island).. the hotel room in US dollar (work for dollar and spend into dollar is fine) is acceptable BUT it is too much for citizen of the country to convert the currency of money. FOREIGNER visiting other country their money have more value (exchange rate)... some foreigner (let's say a rich person CAN afford to visit or  purchased other Island or business investment) .... BUT ... it is also depend to what and who... another example: It is depend LOCATION, a small house (from estate or agent) to conversion of money (let's say dollar to pesos) In Philippines a decent house is more expensive to compare to the house I used to have...  When my brother-in-law (french) visited us ... just for KNOWLEDGE or idea, still the house in Philippines more money to compare to the houses around...... another example: My parents want to build a house they have in mind.... so they do not want to LOAN to the bank (which they are qualified to do so at that time)... my mother do not want any worry. so she saved money and pay cash for piece of land. And saved again then when enough to build a decent house THEN they start the building the house.... what is the different is that THE LAND (per square foot) IS SO EXPENSIVE to compare to other area (location) the piece of land worth can be three time worth to other area. SO in everything includes PLANNING, BUDGETING, asking REASON why it is necessary.... what is the GOAL...........  I ask my mother why our house and land is small to compare to our neighbors because we have big family (in our area... our neighbor have one child, next have three children, and next have one child).... mother explain to me.... LOAN is nice to the EARS but painful to HER (mother) pocket.... Yes, she is qualified to borrow money to the bank but she made the right decision.... heaven knows best our neighbor work as a government employees and some privilege or benefits opportunity.... deductible from their salary BUT and BUT be CAREFUL to any retirement money (invested)  BECAUSE their house can be foreclosure and wasted all the money they gave (or paid). ANOTHER EXAMPLE: You purchased a land (sq ft as you like) and transaction you already gave certain amount of money. THEN duration period with interest monthly to pay the balance of land purchased... let's say contract is two years... One years you put effort to pay BUT then stop because something happen (loss job or emergency prioritizing)... with five months late payment and with interest... MORE you cannot afford to pay, so it will be thank you to you.... TIME and EFFORT of hard work was gone, just like that. I am so deeply thankful and grateful for the opportunity I question my mother for some stuff I do not understand and with her warm heart never get tire to express her thoughts and feelings to some CERTAIN situation.... mother do not like to share problem BUT I am thankful because Signs and symptoms of language of thoughts and feelings.. I know my mother because even I was just a little kid I UNDERSTOOD tender loving care through action. From fetus as passive immunity (warm caring heart) acquired and immune response with gentle gracious warm heart. One of the reason I can read their thoughts and feelings because I do not know, I just feel it. BECAUSE I spent time with them. Word is silent because Silent is action.. Tender Loving Care is not only a word but ACTION as verb. The side effect was EFFECTIVE because I am  thankful and grateful  to my beloved parents, siblings and loved ones with their warm HEARTS..... CURRENCY ... a money conversion to some with higher value and to some same value and to some low value............................. Tender Loving Care is like a CURRENCY BOND.... value in legal tender.

Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name ‚ÄúBantayan sa Hari‚Äù (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to ‚ÄúBantayan,‚Äù the name it's known as today.

945,225524117535380_1177235242364258,"On Monday, we published a video on our YouTube channel in which some of us tried Indian Snacks from Little India. 

It was our intention to create a video celebrating Deepavali, but because of the poor execution of the video, we ended up offending a sizeable community of fellow Singaporeans.

The video should never have been produced and we removed it as soon as we realised our mistake.

The feedback we've received over the past 2 days have been vital in helping us identify our shortcomings. This is a big learning lesson we'll take with us moving forward.

We apologise again for this mistake and we will not be producing content like this again. ","That's okay! The video was made with good intentions. Stuff just went wrong along the way. But thanks for trying! üòä$$just in case some of you missed it. singaporeans try is the name of one of their show and they have others like pretty smart, talk on the street etc. it can be singaporeans try: indian snacks, singaporeans try: chinese snacks or singaporeans try: whatever. you get the idea. regardless whether it‚Äôs chinese, malay, indian or caucasian in the title, it is just an adjective. if you felt offended because it‚Äôs racist, it‚Äôs just like saying the statement, i feel like eating malay food for lunch, is racist. tell me how would you describe the snacks that they tried in the video? 

regarding the content, if one gives a blank look when asked about a festive celebration doesn‚Äôt equate to being racist. i vaguely remember TSL doing a video on chinese new year or some chinese festival and the participants(mostly chinese) have no clue to most of the questions asked. so are they dissing their own race? their videos are meant to create awareness for the mass and some comments have forced them to take it down. this has in turn taken away the opportunity that this video has for other to learn about snacks some of us don‚Äôt even know existed. i hope i did not step on anyone‚Äôs toe with this comment. TSL, don‚Äôt be discouraged by this incident. you guys have been doing a great job.$$Had been an avid fan of the smartlocals videos as they never fail to put a smile on people's faces with their quirky content.

I had the fortune or the misfortune of watching the video that has since been taken down. I must say that It is rather sad that content was created to make people laugh at the expense of a community.

Furthermore, it just highlights the blatant privilege that exists in Singapore, and I guess that privilege is widely abundant in the smart local as well.

This ultimately point to not only a failure of the system that allowed for the creation and release of such content, but the greater ignorance that must have been present in the organization.

I hope thesmartlocal will understand that Singapore is not only defined by it's ethnic majority and that the minority groups are also part of the community. We don't deserve to be treated like outsiders to be tasted, sampled and critiqued.$$I've come to love you guys a lot. Your videos are always sincere in nature with good local content. I did not managed to watch the video to actually decide if it is truly negative in nature. If it really is as what the social media is painting it to be, it really is out of character for you guys. I hope you guys can truly learn from this and continue to be the awesome content creator in YouTube.$$Combating racism by classifying everybody according to their race & encouraging professional victimhood. illiberal means of preventing free exchange of ideas. what trigger happy singaporeans.

Rather than be quick to remove said video, keep it online for everyone to watch, to encourage an open dialogue about race.$$Dear smart local, don't stop producing awesome stuff! We make mistakes in life. Gotta move forward. People fly off the hook so easily, you Ë∑≥ËøõÈªÑÊ≤≥‰πüÊ¥ó‰∏çÊ∏Ö.$$Smart Local, I enjoy most of your contents, creative indeed. I have not seen the deepavali video, however, hope you guys can do another video with proper content and theme to cheer up deepavali. cheers$$For those wondering what was wrong with the video, this article explains it quite succinctly: http://mothership.sg/2016/10/the-smart-local-ruins-deepavali-for-sporean-indians-with-insensitive-racist-video/
Apart from the disdainful faces and comments, this line pretty much sums up why the video was so ridiculous: ""the most adverse connotation of the video was the treatment of Indians as if they are foreign to Singapore, to be sampled and passed judgement on.""$$Well guys, it's hard to not learn from it. Don't call food from someone else's culture diarrhea or anything along those lines ... 
and also... don't get ah lians (esp those with 0 sensitivity) for your videos please.$$If you were racist, apologise for your racism. Otherwise you're just missing the point and fucking up more. ""Poor execution""? Is a piss poor euphemism for what your video actually was, which was racist.$$When you have a team that is filled with Chinese majority, such ""incidents"" are the norms.

Nothing but toxic.$$TSL: so you are sorry because video was not good and poor execution and etc etc. that is why you are apologizing. But you are not sad and apologetic that you hurt the sentiments of a minority community who is as much Singaporean as others and you had audacity to just mock them and their culture and make fun or look down on them ???? How ironic, is that what your culture and values teaches you? Have you even thought if such thing would happen to you or your culture and cultural festivities then how angry, upset or sad you would feel ??? Food for thought for those on your team who could be so boldly racist, provocative and insensitive...even here in Singapore. Shame on such folks.$$This is was supposed to be a celebration of Diwali - the festival of all festivals for Indians. There is nothing celebratory about racism. This just made the divide between races That much clearer. The ignorance was sickening. I have no idea how you fathomed this was okay. Did you actually think this was funny? 

Apologise for your racist video. 
Own up to that. There is no going around the fact that this was blatantly racist.$$""Poor execution""? Why - was comparing Indian food to diarrhea meant to be said in interpretive dance?$$The word 'sorry' isn't even in here. This entire thing looks so corporate..like you know the general PR template used to fight fire. 

Apology Not personal enough really aka not sincere enough. Yet the video has hit a personal spot with the associated people.$$I did spot some flaws in the video but didnt think it would blow up. Was puzzled too they made a video abt Deepavali but I didnt spot any local Indian in the vid..$$how was such blatantly insulting content get through the editorial in the first place?! mind boggling! üò° it's an insult to the wide spectrum of cultural diversity in Singapore that you don't deserve to claim to be so Smart about.$$You should re-upload it again. 
This time, to show proof and concrete evidence that Racism and Chinese Privilege still exist.$$I'm a huge fan of TSL, but really, this is so disappointing. This is exactly why you need an Indian in your team as well to avoid these kinda screw ups.$$I seriously think there has been an unnecessary hoohah over this video. TSL should not have deleted the video and let more people watch this and form their own opinion of it instead of succumbing to the few who watched and protested. In fact, thanks to this video, I learnt of a few Indian snacks which I have not heard of and I can't wait to try them. Give these kids a break. Peace, Out.$$Donovan, for goodness sake stop trying to promote your stupid fb entry lah. It's embarrassing; using this post to gain traction on urs.$$Admin: you should name ur pg as TheStupidLocal. com That sound better.$$Does anyone have a link to the video!? How bad can the video be!? I'm curious!$$TheSmartLocal.com I'm pretty aghast to see the kinds of posts which you are responding to, and the posts which you are liking (it's terribly easy to observe this). It makes me harbour more than a little doubt about how sincere your apology is.$$Not sure why there is a need for TheSmartLocal.com to apologise. Also not sure why the people commenting here are perceiving this as a ""mistake"". The ""facts"" of this entire saga is based on the dubious hearsay of one news site and some stray Facebook comments, since literally no one's watched the video that was taken down. If anyone reading this is interested to see what I mean, read what I already wrote and tell me again that you disagree. https://www.facebook.com/donovan.choy/posts/10210855810741367?pnref=story

Originated by the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, Eid'l Fitr is a cause for celebration and thanksgiving to Allah. It was proclaimed a national holiday in the Philippines since 2002, and was the first predominantly Christian country to do so. This proclamation was intended to foster peace and goodwill between major religions in the Philippines. Most Filipino-Muslims gather together on this day to celebrate the month long feast of Ramadan. ","Widely celebrated? it was declared a national holiday but few only knows about it.$$The Philippines is a Catholic Country and once again we have to let outsiders in and change the country. No Not in Italy we do not recognize Islam as a religion. When Sheiks get 9 yr old girls and marry multiple women.

My name is MARVIS MARCEL from KENYA and I'm happily married to a lovely and caring

husband,with two kids.A very big problem occurred in my family seven months ago,between me and my husband.so terrible that he took the

case to court for a

divorce.he said that he never wanted to stay with me again,and that he didn't love me anymore.So he packed out of my house

and made me and

my children passed through several pain. I tried all my possible means to get her back,after much begging,but all to no avail.and he

confirmed it that he has made her decision,and he never wanted to see me again.

So on one evening,as i was coming back from work,i met an old friend of mine who asked of my husband.So i explained every thing to

her,so he told me that the only way i can get my husband back,is to visit a spell caster,because it has really worked for her too.So i never

believed in spell,but i had no other choice,than to follow her advice. Then he gave me the email address of the spell caster whom

he visited spellsolutiontemple20@gmail.com So the next morning,i sent a mail to the address he gave to me,and the spell caster

assured me that i will get my husband back the next day.What an amazing statement!! I never believed,so he spoke with me,and told me

everything that i need to do. Then the next morning, So surprisingly, my husband who didn't call me for the past seven {7}months, gave

me a call to inform me that he was coming back.So Amazing!! So that was how he came back that same day,with lots of love and

joy,and he apologized for her mistake,and for the pain he caused me and my children. Then from that day,our relationship was now

stronger than how it were before,by the help of a spell caster.

This thought has always intrigued me, mostly because of the sense of appreciation for each. When it comes to experiences, we tend to only understand their importance in the long run. In the moment, we can of course enjoy them. However we may not be able to fully absorb their effect on us until much later on. On the other hand, materialistic belongings have their biggest value when first acquired. Like your mobile phone, for instance. The prized possession you couldn't take your eyes off of the day you brought it home, but has since become just another thing you have, and use. This is what propelled me to start traveling this past year, and I haven't looked back.

Studied so much about this country..Much history those Pinoy/Americans know very little about their home country & the past that Pilipinos went through with Spain & the US, yet coming out of that dark era they became such humble caring lovely people, as they always were trading peacefully & tribal for thousands of years, with ancient writings and connections as far as Morroco & India who settled in this country long before the Spanish. It is an endless wonder & mystical.. The OFWs here in Australia are not like the Pilipino people you meet in the Provence.. As a Kiwi/ New Zealander/Aotearoa I can relate to many things in Philippines. The Seafood & fresh organic produce and happy people...The singing, the diversity of culture! Can't wait to leave Australia one day for the Philippines!$$Truly amazing!! We took our first family trip there this past summer and stayed in Palawan. It was absolutely stunning!$$Coron, the small paradise shows the endless beauty of the Philippines. Please share if you like it!

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what‚Äôs around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to development in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into 
knowing existence.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Although we have been married for 15 years, we feel that it is especially during this period that more effort has to be put in to keep the flame burning.$$Weekends are meant for staycations! I felt like I just went to a short trip to overseas. Feeling super refreshed and recharged my power! There are enough facilities, you do not need to go out. To me, it is the perfect hassle-free holiday! Liked and shared.$$Helps me feel rejuvenated & be able to breathe in life's goodness like the lady in the picture. Been a long long while since I felt so carefree and hence, life's simplest pleasures such as staycations will definitely bring about much needed therapeutic magic and wonders! :)$$I love staycations because it allows me to take a break from the hectic life in Singapore to indulge, relax, enjoy and spend quality time with my husband and kids$$The perfect way to spend the weekend, to be away from reality for a short time ^^$$My love for staycation is mainly for my toddlers and pre-schooler. The fact that we are still in Singapore puts us at ease if my kids suddenly became sick and ill, we can head to the nearest clinic or hospital or rush home to get medicine. We can also be assured that their milk and diapers are readily available, cut down on distance travelling and the frustrations of clearing customs and our loved ones like grandparents can join us at any point of the staycation. Isnt that wonderful?$$Staycation offers the opportunity to reconnect with your significant other or family, away from the bustling city life. An opportunity to chill out from the noise and to rediscover Singapore, and definitely to recharge for the coming week. Allowing the duality of 'urban-chic-tranquility' and local delights, all within the comfort of home.$$Staycation is great because I am more familiar here and at the same time pampering myself in the hotel.$$Best way to travel your mind, body and soul out of the world, locally. $$I love staycations because... I can be a tourist in Singapore for a day. Also, who doesn't love breakfast buffets? Yes, my favourite part about staying in hotels is definitely the breakfast HAHAHA.$$Good location and very nice ambience... will definitely have a good experience if been rewarded...  $$No fuss and go straight to vacation time!!$$Able to sleep the whole day without being nag and pull out of bed.. Recharging mode when in staycation..$$no need to fly, pack so much, can rest and eat more & still go to work the next day!!  what's there not to love!! <3$$Staycation: The only time I can take a break away from home, right at home! ;-)$$We do not have the luxury of time to go for long overseas trips, so a short staycation is a good way to catch up and spend some quality time with my loved ones. This short break is essential for such hectic work life in Singapore.$$what i like most bout staycations are when i can just stay up with my friends, watching movies, eating and drinking, basically just having fun!!$$Staycation means to have fun while relaxing!  Taking a break from work and recharged!$$Getting away from stressed up work and spending time with your love ones = priceless. :D$$Staycations are great cos they signify short getaways without having to travel long journeys.

Philippines. Staring contests. More fun in the. Philippines. Going with the flow. More fun in the. Philippines. Beaches. Openbars. More fun in the ..The Philippines , officially known as the Republic of the Philippines , is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. To its north across the Luzon Strait lies Taiwan; west across the South China Sea sits Vietnam; southwest is the island of Borneo across the Sulu Sea, and to the south the Celebes Sea separates it from other islands of Indonesia; while to the east it is bounded by the Philippine Sea and the island-nation of Palau. Its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator make the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons, but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world‚Äôs greatest biodiversity. At 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 sq mi), the Philippines is the 64th-largest country in the world, consisting of an archipelago of 7,107 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Its capital city is Manila while its most populous city is Quezon City; both are part of Metro Manila.With a population of at least 99 million people, the Philippines is the seventh-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world. An additional 12 million Filipinos live overseas, comprising one of the world‚Äôs largest and most influential diasporas. Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands. In prehistoric times, Negritos were some of the archipelago‚Äôs earliest inhabitants. They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples who came from Malay, Indian, and Islamic states. Various nations were established under the rule of Datus, Rajahs, Sultans or Lakans. Trade with China also introduced Chinese culture and settlement, which remain present to this day.The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 marked the beginning of an era of Spanish interest and eventual colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. The Spanish Empire began to settle with the arrival of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi from New Spain (present day Mexico) in 1565 who established the first Spanish settlement in the archipelago, which remained a Spanish colony for more than 300 years. This resulted in the predominant religion in the country to be Roman Catholicism and it is one of two countries in Asia; the other being East Timor. During this time, Manila became the Asian hub of the Manila‚ÄìAcapulco galleon trade.As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution, which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic; the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War; and the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. In the aftermath, the United States emerged as the dominant power; aside from the period of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands. After World War II, the Treaty of Manila recognised the Philippine Republic as an independent nation. Since then, the Philippines has had an often tumultuous experience with democracy, with popular ‚Äúpeople power‚Äù movements overthrowing a dictatorship in one instance, but also underlining the institutional weaknesses of its constitutional republic in others. The Philippines currently has one of Asia‚Äôs fastest growing economies, and the nation‚Äôs large population size and economic potential have led it to be classified as a middle power.$$yes !

What is it like? 
When fish swim in the same direction and in a coordinated manner, the behavior is called ""schooling."" But when they're together, interacting, it's called ""shoaling"". Fish shoal for protection against predators, better chances of finding food, and better chances of finding a mate ‚Äì a shoalmate! You can watch schools or shoals of fish when you go snorkeling in Puerto Princesa's marine attractions, such as Honda Bay.

Fun Fact: 
Fish don't just randomly join a group. Like people, they pick who to hang out with ‚Äì who their mates will be. And generally, they like large shoals with fish who are healthy and resemble their appearance. This is because a fish that stands out will be easy prey.

Evening had dinner at Poulet and shopped at Sephora, BHG and other stores, while indulging in snacks. Ended the day with a mid night movie.

The earthquake that rocked the mountain on the 5th of June, 7:15am triggered landslides along with rocks and boulders that tumbled down, destroying trails and sadly, taking lives. Joseph was found beneath a boulder, in the heroic act of shielding two of his guests. Unfortunately, the three of them didn‚Äôt survive.

Joseph was last seen hugging two of his guests, in an attempt to protect them, using his body as a shield, an account related by his fellow mountain guide colleague, Sharulnizam Suhaji.

What is it?
In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

Proud Waraynon!$$So far, my favorite island in the Philippines!  It's really incredible!$$Been there! Nice place! More fun in the Philippines!$$Been there! Beautiful kalanggaman island$$I propose to the first stage of the restoration of the rivers of the Republic of the Philippines. Take the work of any mountain of 300 meters and above.
Towards the large flows of water from the mountain, at an altitude of, say, 1,000 meters, set concrete or plastic tubs, for example, 10 pieces of 10 meters in height. We got an inclined ladder. Accumulate in the tenth of a bath, the water is poured into the ninth, and so on, until the first bath.
From the first bath tubes protrude, and the water falls directly to the foot of the mountain where dug pond storage of chilled water.
So, what happened:
Crystal clear, enriched with all kinds of trace elements, accumulated in the bath at a height of 1000 meters. Her temperature is 6.7 degrees lower than at the foot of a law lowering the temperature due to the increase in height. The same temperature and ponds.
Hence, when applying several staircase, cool water of the river, roughly: the river basin area is multiplied by 6.7, divide by 100 and get no volatility, that is, the moisture remaining in the river
The results:
First. The lake is an accumulation of clear water, where you can drink for children and pregnant women, and surplus to sell and earn income.
Second. Chilled water from the lake gradually cools the water in the river, percolates down and cools the water in the surface and underground waters. Cooling reduces the volatility of all types of water resources, the accumulation of water and improve its quality due to dilution.
The third. Accumulation of water in rivers, reservoirs above and below ground, the increase of productive land, pastures and forests. And the creation of new jobs.
And a fourth. Received a standing simple actions and penny cost technology that will work without consuming any energy resources to 1,000 years - the life of concrete or plastic in an inactive environment.
Other parameters:
The falling water to turn the turbines can, and to provide electricity to farmers.
My technique, unlike the desalination and purification, which consume electricity like a monster, 365 days a year, of energy resources not consume.
Desalination and purification of the same 365 days a year emit hot air, that the warming will not be tolerated at all. My technology is no air emissions do not produce.
Permanent staff do not require.
Cheaper any human to 3-5.
Not so, but such technologies are available dozens of cubic kilometers of water, and to capitalize on this in the Amazon and the rivers of Africa to 0.3 trillion on.

Soft corals prefer nutrient-rich waters and less light. They may look like plants, but corals are marine animals that need food. And this type feeds on zooplankton, or organisms incapable of swimming against a current ‚Äì making it the ideal treat for hungry marine creatures. You can find soft corals in Anilao's colorful underwater gardens, which are home to all sorts of tropical fish.

Let us know if you agree or have other tips for first-time visitors.Hong Kong is an incredible city and what I consider the gateway to Asia. Just about every local speaks English here so for first-time travellers to Asia,...","Stayed at Largos Hotel near Nathan Road during my first visit and I must say the location is perfect! Fact: For my three-day stay I toured around the city by foot. The only times I rode public transportation were from the Ferry Port going to my hotel and Bus going to the airport. I think t'was a great experience. I really enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the city coz my hometown is pretty much laid back and HK is quite the opposite! Will be back soon for sure!$$Usually i live near causeway bay mtr or, better for me, near tin hau mtr, whitfield Street.  Some tips: West Kowloon culture park...if you Like running go to quarry bay riveraide park so tou can enjoy also a view og kowloon bay. Take the bus from Central to repulse bay and Stanley market...then catch up some small beach for enjoy sun and quiet...come back to North and take a walking on the Mid Levels...then stop for get some good and drink there. Go to Tsim Sha Tsui At 8pm and enjoy the simphony of lights, so nice and so commercial..then so annoying maybe! Don't miss to taste an egg tart and take the ferry to come back to Island.$$I've always stayed in Hotels on, or near to Nathan Road. Everything from the various Markets to high end shopping. And the McDonalds (for the western palate). However, I'd like to try staying across the water next time. Maybe down near the Ding-ding tracks.$$We stayed at Courtyard Marriott in Sha Tin.  A little out of the way but if you time it right, there is a free shuttle that takes you to TST and back.  During our 2 weeks there, we really enjoyed this hotel especially the executive lounge - great snacks and drinks for free!$$You missed my favourite place to stay in HK which I'm not mentioning- you mentioned places around it- as I don't want it any better known than it is! :)$$Langham place (cordis) most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in. Will be staying again in december and staying for nye.

Nice to be out of the complete hustle and bustle but feel like you are in the midst of HK.  Great bus links and eateries around as well as having amazing views of the park and harbour.  Definetely my choice whenever we visit :)$$These places are obvious locations and for tourists who want it safe but where money is not an issue. Other locations next to these locations such as Sheung Wan, Causeway Bay, Hung Hum, and even Tung Chung, are cheaper and just as convenient. The author should explore more than where all the tourists go.$$Loved the Excelsior Hotel on causeway bay . Hotel overlooks the noon day gun which is fired everyday at 12 noon$$Tips for whom travel by themselves to HK in the first time are to ask any information at the booth for visitors at the airport (a red booth), they advise clearly and stay in hostels in Mong Kok not expensive.$$Every time I've stayed in HK it's been at Garden View on McDonnell St, Central and it's a short walk down to the Peak Tram, a little further and you can walk to Central or Admiralty/ Pacific Plaza. Have to agree with the review.$$Courtyard at Connaught Rd. I loved walking around and discovered by accident the elevated walkways. Incredible.

Carrying one's heavy pack along with the items of the rest of the group throughout the duration of the trek, which could last up to 10 or more hours per day depending on the trail, is something mountain guides and porters are willing to sacrifice for in exchange for a better source of income.

Where majority of our provincial lands' main source of livelihood rest in farming or fishing, most of these guides go back to such labor when they have no group to guide in the mountains.

But being a guide can earn four to five times more than what one can earn from fishing or farming in a day, and that is why they are willing to make the sacrifice and even eager to do so. At night in the campsite, they take shots of local rum, not to get drunk, but to ease their bodies from the pain and protect themselves from the cold. 

With better accessibility to the mountains, locals who lead groups visiting as guides or as porters, certainly have a better chance of living, and more money to feed their families.

We shouldn't take it against them for making a decent living out of being a guide or a porter. While there are those local communities who sadly and unfortunately abuse this opportunity, there are still those who do not and are very adamant about providing job opportunities for the locals while at the same time preserving the natural habitat of the mountains in their community.

From among these are the guides I met in Kanlaon Volcano in Negros. They limit climbers to 10 per day and require permits for any mountaineer visiting. They uphold the model for responsible mountaineering.

What is it?
The series of protruding limestone formations unique to Palawan make the province home to lakes as well. These lakes are formed when water is trapped in the spaces in between the limestone cliffs. 

Fun Fact:
A Palawan getaway wouldn‚Äôt be complete without limestone cliff diving. The otherworldly rock formations make a picturesque backdrop for jumpshot-off-the-cliff photos.

We asked a former SIA girl, who told us how staff are ranked according to how many MCs they take.

https://mustsharenews.com/sia-mc-appraisals/","You never feel like the company looks out for you, not just in terms of MCs, but even in things like just basic protection of their staff. Remember the case where the SIA stewardess got slapped while on a flight by an upset wife? I remember the words of the SIA spokesperson; ""this is a personal matter, not a company matter"". She wouldn't even be on the damn plane if she wasn't WORKING FOR YOUR COMPANY, CAN?! How DARE you claim it's not a company matter when she's wearing the very uniform that made your company famous, working on one of your planes, talking to one of your passengers? I left after two years because there's no point destroying your body working for a company that will call you for a flight on midnight of the day your MC expires. Because sure, my illness will magically expire the second the clock strikes midnight, like I'm some kind of miracle healing Cinderella.$$Seriously I could never understand why people always chose to remain silent and are only willing to make noise and speak up when a human life is lost.

I find that most people can't work smart. We are born with choices. Its sad that people now value more about the stacks of cash in their bank accounts then their health. A life is so much more valuable.$$Aiyoooo pleassseeee~~ Do u all know that air crew gets 21 days Annual Leave and on the average about 100 off days a year. 

SIA rewards crew with a medical benefit of $300/year( or is it $200, I can't remember) for those who take extra care of their health and not fall sick. 

No one is forcing anyone to go on flight Sick. BUT there are really a lot of ""chao Geng"" crew out there who always conveniently falls sick on occasions like New Year eve, Christmas and especially when they are rostered for shitty low paying flights such as Sydney, Bombay for e.g. 

An employee can be damn good at her job, but if she lacks discipline and responsibility. Who can you blame. 

So the rest of those who works hard and make an effort to stay healthy to stay to their rosters are idiots is it? 

I am an ex crew who had taken numerous MCs, prolly falling into the mid ""chao geng"" category and I still qualified for promotion interview. 

P.S : I'm speaking up on behalf of the other flying crew who can't say no sh*t because the other crew members would aim them for speaking their mind. So yah, dun like what I say. Too bad.$$This is sooooo true and sooooo inhumane of a company to treat their employees. Also it has become a competition to see who score the highest based on MC rate. So unfair! How can your crew be happy working if the company doesn't care for their employees welfare!$$It's not just the flight crews I heard. Ground staff, in other subsidiaries like engineering also from what I heard from friends who work there. Apparently , in engineering , my Friend said if you took more than 7 days MC, you won't be eligible for the free staff air travel benefit for certain period of time. Not sure if really true but it's really sad if it is. That's why many afraid to take mc even if genuinely sick. Dunno why MOM so bo chap. How can staff benefit also be tied to how many mc u take. Not ethical at all.$$Boycott Sia! All passengers can get sick too due to the sick flight attendants whom FORCED to work.. the virus will spread faster in enclosed cabins ...$$Dun blame anyone!

And even more greater thing is that KTO always listens to people and tries to make it even better :) Excellent$$When I'm using the term culture I mean it in the broad sense - so both traditional and modern - but sometimes the most modern is the best reflection of your culture.

These are successful stories of our tourism frontliners who prove how inclusive the tourism industry can be. Their stories are told by various local travelers around the Philippines whose journey would not have been more fun and much easier without the help they got from their newfound friends.

This week, we begin with the story of Jacob Maentz (@jacob.maentz on Instagram), a documentary and travel photographer from Cebu:

""I met Captain Angel Torres in Bais Bay during an early morning excursion to see the dolphins of Ta√±on Strait. Ta√±on Strait lies between Negros Oriental and Cebu and is the largest protected seascape in the country. It is home to spinner dolphins, dwarf sperm whales, spotted dolphins and pygmy killer whales. Today, a number of fishermen and other locals work part-time as captains or crew for some 15 boat tours around Ta√±on Strait, Angel being one of them. Visitors can get a glimpse of the marine mammals during early morning dolphin-watching trips.

""Back in the early 90‚Äôs dolphin meat was sold for P10 per kilo and was a common part of the local diet. Marine species would also be hunted for pure sport, mainly because no one knew any better explained Angel. In the mid-1990‚Äôs much of that changed when the LGU implemented a number of environmental laws to protect the dolphins and whales in the area.  Tourism now provides a livelihood for local fishermen and the marine life is better protected. ""

Not a lot of people know that Tribal Adventure Day Tours are offered on this island. These are no ordinary tours. You spend an entire day getting to know the indigenous people living In the area.

Vists the Filipinos learn about the country$$The majority of the Filipinos are awesome people, but just like any other country, they have corrupt government officials.$$It's an incredible country with incredible people.  There is so much I can write about them but all I can say is, how wonderful to see another episode on this country.$$Dear leaders of the Philippines!
Offers its program to restore the water balance of the Philippines, and the elimination of surface and underground earthquakes.
In the Philippines, will be carried out work on the restoration of rivers and ground and underground reservoirs in the level and purity. This will increase the productive land and pastures (which will create new jobs, increase in agricultural and meat dairy products), and the cultivation of new forests arrays.
Finally, and most importantly, what needs to be done immediately.
Philippines - a country of many mountain formations. Mountain formation and adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates were many thousands of years in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And such or similar joints in the Philippines and around - many dozens.
Quote: ""The area of the Philippines is located in the zone of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, and even the coast of the Philippines is a zone of subduction, where oceanic crust is turned in under the mainland. subduction zone is also called the Benioff zone, because it has the largest number of deep earthquakes. ""
""In the Philippines, for the year on average, there is more than 35 earthquakes (on average by 3 earthquakes per month) magnitude of 5.0 - 5.9, one earthquake of magnitude 6.0 - 6.9 or 7.0 - 7.9, then this country can be considered one of the most seismically active areas in the world. ""
Physics. The warming heats the surface and underground rock formations of the Philippines. By law, all of physics solid crystalline formations expands when heated, destroying themselves and the surrounding formation, and form of the earthquake and tsunami.
The scheme is simple to prevent earthquakes.
My program is cooled all the big and small rivers. Rivers carry cooled water into the surrounding body of water Philippines, cooled water, rock formations both on land and at sea, to prevent the appearance of surface and submarine earthquakes and tsunamis.
During 7 years - 15% in a year - I chilled all rock formations to the level of 1980. There basting to reduce the damage from the hurricane, the theme of excess current, but it is still in operation.
One technology - ""Ladder"", which explains the principle of cooling rock formations, tectonic and lithospheric plates - I'm sending you. But it is more suitable for hospitals, schools, and kindergartens, and partially cools the water area around the Philippines. At the prompt, I'll bring the technology is three times more powerful than the ""Ladder"".

The seven rivers of the forest create a landscape filled with evergreen vegetation along the riversides, dry deciduous and tropical thorn forests.

Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and Sicogon Development Corporation (SIDECO) will launch Sicogon Island Tourism Estate development within the first half of 2016.

The ALI-SIDECO joint venture is expected to drive economic progress in Western Visayas and the entire region as it serves as a tourism hub for surrounding or nearby destinations like Gigantes, Bantayan and Concepcion islands.

The 1,100-hectare Sicogon Island will feature a balanced mix of developments, such as a resort town center, hotels and resorts, as well as commercial and residential establishments, supported by an on-site airstrip.  The ground breaking of the airport runway is scheduled for the second half of the year.

‚ÄúThe initial development will concentrate on building the airport and runway, to ensure accessibility to the island,‚Äù said Jose Emmanuel Jalandoni, ALI Senior vice president and group head of commercial business.  ‚ÄúThe 1.3-kilometer runway will allow immediate access from Manila and Cebu to the island development,‚Äù he added, saying further that test flights to Sicogon are being targeted for the first quarter of 2017.

The project is supported by public, private and community organizations, and government bodies alike because of the potential economic benefits it will bring to the region.  A framework agreement was signed by ALI, SIDECO, and the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk Association (FESIFFA) in 2014 to pave the way for the sustainable development of Sicogon Island.  The group has been assisting the local community through skills training and livelihood programs to make them active partners in the development.

‚ÄúWe strongly believe and hope that poverty alleviation will be achieved through tourism projects.  These will give us various job opportunities and help us improve farming and fishing methods,‚Äù said Raul Ramos, president of FESIFFA.

Jalandoni stressed that sustainability will be a main focus of the project.  Aside from allocating more than 50% of the development for open green space, ALI will also work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to continue stewardship of Sicogon‚Äôs forested area, and work on coastal protection and marine life rehabilitation in support of sustainable development.

‚ÄúMore than becoming a premier tourist destination and a tourism hub for the region, Sicogon is envisioned to provide inclusive growth and economic development through long-term recovery and livelihood programs, and job creation,‚Äù said Jalandoni.

ALI estimates that the Sicogon Island development will provide 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly with increased tourism, and approximately P1 billion in earnings for the community through business opportunities that will come from the retail and commercial establishments.

Till now, Fitbit is the only HRM I can find, that stores heart rate data at 1 second intervals during exercise tracking and at 5 second intervals all other times. Other HRMs usually measure continuous heart rate every few minutes. Fitbit's higher frequency should result in more accurate resting heart rate (RHR) figures, which can be an indicator of your overall health. The lower your RHR, the better. :)$$I am most excited to use the Cardio Fitness Level!!!

Joyce Liang$$Hello TheSmartLocal.com and pan pac, thanks for organising this staycation giveaway!
For me, I'd hope to win it for my dad and my mom. We generally don't travel much together and hence, don't stay in hotels also because my parents find it too expensive. I hope they get to experience the luxury and comfort that others enjoy too. There was once my dad mentioned that he wanted to bring us to a hotel buffet as a surprise weekend lunch. Hearing that made me realise how special a buffet, much less one held at a hotel was for him, even though we might consider it to be nothing much. Therefore if they get to stay there, I can imagine how it will come as a huge shock and surprise for the both of them.

Warren Soo$$As my partner and I are currently in a long distance relationship, time spent together in Singapore when I'm back in town are precious to us. Due to my partner's work commitment, we are not able to travel overseas for holidays.

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University‚Äôs Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don‚Äôt welcome science. They didn‚Äôt provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport‚Äôs History.
That‚Äôs Why I Couldn‚Äôt to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Yours Cordially

This is dedicated to all our Muslim friends out there who now have to bear the world's hatred. It should be directed at Terrorists, not Muslims. But sadly, people are going to generalise.

It is unfair that a tiny group with a distorted view of religion could cause so much distress to both Muslims and Non-Muslims. ","Please be aware that The Islamic State aka ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq & Syria) does not & will not represent all Muslim & Islam as a religion.

No religion preach violence or to harm others nor themselves. Terrorism is not an religion but an act of immorality against humanity & everything good that comes out from Peace.

We all must be educated to know this difference & not be misled.

News & media are using 'Islamic State' because that's what the terrorist group called themselves. Technically it isn't wrong but many whom are not aware might be mislead into relating Islam as a religion supporting such act of evil. It is ISIS agenda to create more hatred & making believe that all Muslims are apart of them. Creating a greater social diversity & unrest among people, nations & religions.

We as an individual can help to spread the understanding. A small action against terrorism, help to keep humanity & harmony in place. We are all a part of something bigger. Fight terrorism!

What is it? 
This island group is composed of the main Olango Island and its six satellite islets. The site is a wildlife sanctuary that serves as a pit stop for migratory birds that come from as far as China, Japan and Siberia.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

We have been planning this trip for years but hadn't make our first move to book the tickets, so these credits would definitely help us realize our getaway! Tan Ying Bei Natassja Putri$$Hello klook! My ideal get away plan would be one that is affordable, with plenty of good deals and cheap thrills. Im all for value for money deals! üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª This would probably be a free & easy trip to somewhere with sand dunes, camels, beautiful sunsets, wonders of natural, with the companion of my love ones‚ù§Ô∏è$$My ideal plan is.... grabbing a couple of clothes, throwing them into a bag pack and off we (what's a trip without buddies?) go. Then it's just hitting the spots that locals recommend. Nothing says adventure more than spontaneity! üôåüèª$$My ideal getaway plan is something impromptu to a place  closer to Nature where I can put away my phone and just relax. No social media, no calls, no stress from work. Local food, local people and local culture! Liked and shared. üôÇ$$My ideal gateway plan will be going all Museum attractions that will amaze my eyes to just forget the stress. With a great engagement fun and amazing discovery it's worth to take the stress off everything.$$My perfect ideal getaway plan is to travel to China! Afterall, Chinese will be embracing this festival with most gusto and I would like to experience that!
Liked and shared!$$Nothing as ideal as visiting a country with snow, wrapped in warm and fuzzy sweaters, sipping onto a cuppa hot tea latte.  Imagine sitting carefreely in a cafe, watching the falling of those dreamy white flake. How magical!

Liked and shared!$$My ideal getaway plan is to a faraway resort with my family, where we will simply chill and relax, swimming during the day, feasting during the night, and all sorts of island adventures in-between timeslots!!!!$$Hi, I would like to get away from sg to my hometown... I only like visited my family twice a year.. and cny is the only time i can visit all my family members but me as a student cant afford the ticket. Hope can get it.. üôèüèª$$I watched a documentary about a guy walking the Himalayas and thought that will be cool to do - passing through several countries albeit it being dangerous. 

I digress but i think my ideal getaway is being able to try things I haven't tried, that being having a homestay with a nomadic family in Mongolia - helping a nomadic family to migrate, building ger, waking up to be greeted by endless colourful mountains, meeting eagle hunters.

I may not walk the Himalayas but I hope I will have other experiences to make up for it$$It's been barely a month into 2017, but it already feels like I've worked through the entire year. A quiet resort by the beach, coupled with the calming sea breeze and the sound of waves crashing onto the shore. Something to recharge and rethink what the future holds. A trip to clear minds and take a leap of faith into unknown waters, deciding whether to leave behind what shouldn't be held onto.$$My ideal getaway plan is to shop and eat freely. Like honestly, when's the last time anyone's able to let go and just be yourself and not be judged and hounded. Being yourself is fantastic!

When packing your bags for Boracay Island, shoes should be the least of your concerns. You'll be walking barefoot on the powder-fine sand most of the time. And sitting on it. And getting massages on it. You'll form quite an attachment to Boracay sand. Just please don't take any of it home! Leave the beach for others to enjoy.

Fun Fact:
Come dusk, young boys and girls take to the beach to begin sculpting impressive pieces of sand art. For a small fee, they can even personalize the sand art for you!

Sometimes i do mix up ~~ But now okay already ~~$$@Jan-Louis: Sites are good, but how about sharing something from YOUR experience?*^^*$$I just try and pick things up from the Koreans around me. Wherever I go I ask people what is the word for this or that. Or I ask them what they just said. I suppose another thing that was good for me was to start with the phrases that were useful to me, it makes me more motivated when I can use what I have learnt (things like directions etc).$$Something else that can be confusing is Î∞©Í∏à (banggeum) and Í∏àÎ∞© (geumbang). Look it up on Naver if you're curious. ;-)$$I really want to learn korean...so that it will be easier for me to travel korea independently next year$$@Heidi: One of the best things to learn is <<food name, this, that>> + Ï£ºÏÑ∏Ïöî (juseyo).$$""ÎûòÌîÑÌåÖ"" and ""Î≤àÏßÄÏ†êÌîÑ"" are two good words to be able to read in hangeul this summer!$$Thanks for the tip so i know the different now because last time i heard the pronounciation is almost same$$Wow next year me and my friend will visit Korea also on Valentine's day,,$$I don't have hangeul on my computer but the romanization ""place name + odisaeyo"" is useful.

What book are they using? The Singapore branch is very active so it's always fun to hear what's going on.^^$$I can read and write Hangeul, but I can't understand the meaning of the word. and I find it hard to build a sentence in Hangeul.

The Bandhavgarh National Park, lying in the heart of the Vindhya Mountain Range in Central India, is a small and compact National Park, yet full of game. The density of the tiger population at Bandhavgarh is the highest known in India. 
The centre of the park is dominated by the majestic Bandhavgarh Fort built in the 14th century, around which are numerous caves containing shrines and ancient Sanskrit inscriptions. The park has four main entrances, Panpatha in the north, Tala in the east (most of the hotels are located in Tala), Dhamokar in the south-west and Khitauli in the west. Two roads, Umaria-Rewa highway and Parasi-Katni road via Khitauli pass through the park. Tala is a small village on the Umaria-Rewa state highway. 

The Original home of all the white tigers alive, today, Bandhavgarh was the hunting ground of the Maharajas of Rewa; their old fort still dominates a hill in the forest. These white tigers were found in the old state of Rewa for many years. The last known tiger was captured by Maharaja Martand Singh in 1951. The White Tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharaja of Rewa.

It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

Is it possible to reduce the number of earthquakes in Indonesia and to reduce their power?
Can.
Mountain formation, adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates were many thousands of years before the warming in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. Take two bricks to hold them together metal strip, and will be heated. According to the law: solid body expands when heated, bricks expand and collapse. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And there are, or smaller joints in Indonesia and around - many thousands.
Treatment of the first stage. Cooling sushi Indonesia, and water in the surrounding seas. Terms reduce the amount of power and ground and underground earthquake and tsunami - at 15% per year. The second and third stages will give later.
Second. Termination of forest fires due to litter moisture: dry last year's grass, fallen leaves, dead twigs, and the restoration of forest coolness and dampness. And much more.
Third. Restoration of water balance. This is the standard work on the production of drinking and irrigation water, but without it the temperature rise and evaporation impossible to do. Emphasizing that crystal clear drinking water will provide hospitals, schools, pre-schools in the big cities. Clean water will ensure growth in its net production to tourist facilities, and will provide a significant increase in the inflow of tourists.
Such proposals, Indonesia will not get from anyone, and all the disasters will increase and the number and power, and destroy the economy.
Visas to Indonesia me or managers are not needed. Better to call me as a specialist for three months. During that time I, or one of the managers of our bearings, and someone left who - no, but a visa is not the main thing.

http://japan-magazine.jnto.go.jp/en/special_koji-honpo.html ","thanks for Love        LOVE    JAPAN$$Dear Sirs,                             
For 5 years I am an active user of SONY VAIO LAPTOP and SONY PLAYSTATION and very satisfied with the SONY products. For 6 years I use mobile phones from Apple and that what I have to complain about, that happened to me in these 6 years with any of my Apple products.
Through the media, my attention was drawn slowly but surely on the SONY deals on smart phones and was on November 22, 2014, I became a member of the Sony family, because I bought the Sony Xperia Z3 COMPACT (IMEI 355179065283809). First of all I was annoyed that I had not sooner worried me the phone because I loved the design, battery life and until I broke the glass of the back in my pocket by the software about two weeks ago and I injured my finger , Although I have understanding that it may be different in reality than promised in the ads, but that the back so fragmented, although it has come to a pointed object, surprised me very much.
I brought the phone to the competent charging and not surprised that I did not meet the warranty conditions and had to pay 90 TL for changing the glass back. Finally I sat down on it. It has lasted two weeks until I got the phone.
I realized immediately that the Proxmity sensor was not working and was told by the service that the Geraet was incorrectly installed and repaired it. After all the trouble I used the mobile phone full of joy and bought an expensive protective cover to protect it from further unexpected accidents.
But the blow came faster than expected and has brought the camel's back. Last night as I wanted to put me into the car, the phone fell out of my pocket on the ground, there was a height of 30 cm. The glass of the front and the back broke, even though it was in the case is a thousand pieces. I can not afford absolutely no understanding that the phone after a fall of 30 cm can come into this state. None of my friends can not believe it that the phone came with a simple fall into this state.
I'm really disappointed in Sony because they have such bad use or sensitive material, without considering that there is some device (finally a '' MOBILE '') which should withstand some shock or mishaps. For me it's just firmly around held between two panes of glass with fine black-cheap plastic thing that simply join in anything. Frankly, I'm disappointed in myself that I have the Sony familiar advertising and have too little research on the user comments had experienced in the hundreds same.
I can not understand that Sony has chosen as a marketing strategy that finally we have no complaints million per country, only a few hundred. I also do not see that it enters the warranty conditions, although the choice of the material just heard of being attributed to producers and for which the user is not enough information has been advised of the sensibility of the glass.
I should point out that I will do everything possible to make my consumer protection claims and as long as this publicly manifest until I get my right because SONY  Turkey does not take any action and they do not give my money back or change my phone!!! Please help me about this problem as you do to your customers in the United States Of America and United Kingdom and Japan.
With best regards

Security is good too. It's seems that I am not tired of visit South Korea even though I have visited twice previously.

Splendid country with great culture, scenery, nature and people.$$I want to travel to Korea because I love Korea: the culture, food, dramas, songs, people, lifestyle, everything!!!$$I grew up with Korean friends and their Umma's fed me an abundance of Korean food growing up like ÍπÄÎ∞•, ÍπÄÏπò, ÎùºÎ©¥ & Î∂àÍ≥†Í∏∞ (My appetite is practically Korean), I've watched K-dramas growing up that were dubbed in Tagalog when I lived in the Philippines for 6 yrs. My friend's mothers always spoke about their culture and their homeland  and thought me some Korean and how to read & write a bit so much that since I was a wee little girl, Korea has always been on my top places to go visit. It would be nice to actually step foot in Korea and enjoy it myself. Food (street food & royal cuisine), See the palaces, sightsee, shopping (I love Korean skin care too) & Oppa ÏÜ°Ï§ëÍ∏∞ would be a dream come true but what I would cherish the most out of this trip would be to fully immerse myself in the culture, scenery and community in Korea and experience the beauty of the homeland of what the gracious Ummas talked about all these years. Hopefully I get that opportunity! Í∞êÏÇ¨Ìï©ÎãàÎã§! üòä$$Hi! I'm learning many things of that wonderful country (language, gastronomy, history, etc.) and it would be great to see in person the amazing things that South  Korea has! I really hope to be there one day üòç$$I'd like to go to Korea to enjoy the warm hospitality and kindheartedness of Korean people.$$Done! ~ Thank you KTO/Imagine Your Korea for this new online event. :-)$$I really want to go to Korea. The reason is because of Korea is a beautiful country. Of people its a fun and many great places to visit. I also enthusiasts music and Korean drama. it is a pride if I met one of the Idol Korea. In addition, I really want to school in Korea. Of the first, I was trying so that I can to Korea. But there is always a hitch. Hopefully, with this I can go to Korea.$$Never thought that I'd fall in love with korean dramas 'til I watched one of it two years ago. And I love it ever since. Watching the dramas led me to the famous Running Man. I always try my best not to miss any single episode. Lee kwang soo is my favorite. Since he is a best friend to song joong ki, he is my favorite as well. These are enough to make me dream that visiting korea one day would be amazing thing to happen in my life. Not only to witness its beauty but travel with joong ki is another fortune.$$Hello everyone! I badly want to go to korea eversince I'm 14. I studied well and because we had a problem about financial needs i only attended a vocational course. Fortunately, i've graduated. But that's not enough cos i'm always rejected whenever i applied for work(they want college level) My plan is to save money so i can go to my dreamland, korea. But i think it will never happen cos i'm completely broke and if ever i had money, i gave them all to my family. I badly want to go to korea because korean's tradition and cultures always amuses me. Their music, their foods, their mannerism, the way koreans talk. All! Always amazes me. Someday, i want to live in korea for good. But for now, if i will be picked in this trip to korea, i will be the Happiest girl in the world and it will give me more inspiration to my dream to live in korea. I cried once cos i'm making myself woke up in reality that i have no luck and will never have a chance to go there. I really really love that country so bad! I pray every night to our dear god that may he grant my dream to go to korea. thank you admins for this wonderful trip to korea idea. May god bless you all.$$I really like to travel to Korea and  know about your culture, people, places and food.$$I want to travel to korea, because i love the culture, foods, fashion style, shopping.

In Ifugao and every other part of the country, the best tour guides are the locals. They're knowledgeable, friendly and you won't have to worry too much about a language barrier. Filipino dialects may differ from region to region, but almost everyone speaks English. You're more likely to have an interesting conversation, than fumble with a phrase book! 

Fun Fact:
Don't be alarmed by the red-stained mouths of Banaue locals. It's caused by the chewing of nga-nga or betel nuts, which they find addictive.

How to Get There:

The town of Anilao may not have white sand beaches, but its underwater environment is its biggest attraction. Dubbed as the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines, its deep waters teem with marine life and an abundance of corals and reefs. For non-divers ‚Äì the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

Fun Fact:
Diving conditions in Anilao are ideal for divers of all experience levels. The water temperature is consistently warm, and the surface is typically calm and smooth throughout the year.

Our first story is from @vin_aranas87 (on Instagram) who traveled in May 2015 to Itbayat, #Batanes, the northernmost inhabited island of the Philippines. There, he met their tour guide, Kuya Pepe.

""We met Kuya Pepe on our second day and discussed with him our plans of reaching the #RafangCliffs on the eastern side of #Itbayat. Getting to this place needs some great deal of advice from him as he was the only person allowed to pass through private properties leading to Rafang Cliffs.

""Although he was Marine Engineer by profession, Kuya Pepe chose to stay in the island to be with his family and make a living out of tour-guiding. He explained that being a tour guide has helped him with much of their expenses; he was able to send his kids to school until they finished their studies.

The most important documents and communications are digitally sent across the world and are delivered within seconds. Facebook is one of them, it helps to make the world more open and connected. Technology is the force behind it. Now this is what you call making life easier and flexible.$$Due to the amazing advances in technology over the last 10 years, a lot of us now have access to variety in almost every aspect of our lives. If we need a ride, there is no need to stand by a roadside waiting for a cab or to call a cab. Now we whip out our phones and within a few presses a cab comes to us, through apps like Grab, Uber, and even Ryde. We dont have to go to travel agencies and ask which hotel is the best. We just go on Expedia or AirBnB to find accomodation that suits us best. All these examples really reflect how flexible our lives have become because of technology.$$Internet banking has made my life easier by being able to pay my bills before the clock strikes 12mn, so that I won't be liable for late fees!

When ATM machine and AXS first came out it was a great help in reducing waiting time and make life easier and more efficient and as times goes by, technology improve and we now have mobile AXS apps on our phone. This is DIY 2.0, it is an evolution from the standalone DIY machine and has make life even easier for us as we can use it anytime, anywhere.
I am waiting for the day my mobile banking apps can let me withdraw and deposit cash, i believe that day will come$$As an 18 year old man / boy / guy / student, technology has vastly improved my life. 
First of all, lets talk food. Applications like foodpanda, deliveroo, mcdelivery , ect has made ordering of food through calls a thing from the past . We can order food so easily now,  by just tapping, swiping, ordering and paying . "" Hardworking"" and ""busy"" students like me don't have to waste time , going to a hawker centre or fastfood restaurants to queue and wait for food now . There are even apps like Honestbee and RedMart  , that delivers groceries to our homes. 
Secondly , we have applications like zalora , cotton on , sephora , that allows us to order fashion items back to our homes without travelling. We can even buy gifts for our friends through apps like these . Its fast , easy and definitely it has made our lives more flexible . 
There are so many things i can say about technology , though it has it's downs , the ups greatly overthrows them . It's 1:36 am and I have school tomorrow , so imma go now . HAHA i hope i can win those vouchers , cuz i really wanna eat sushi :< And i would love to intern at THESMARTLOCAL.COM ( Sings the theme song ) But i would save that talking for another day :)$$Technology has made life much more flexible in so many different aspects; messaging applications have bridged the gaps between us and have allowed us to connect to one another and share more of our personal lives with each other on the go, real time, even when we're physically apart. Mobile applications have also made it possible for us to pick up languages and other skills during those bus rides & MRT rides, turning self-improvement in our packed school/work lives from a fairy tale to reality. :) With all this advancement of technology, we are now more inspired to further technology, and imagine a better, more flexible future for ourselves. :)$$Liked and shared

I am a InDIYpendent Singaporean in overseas too. I remembered during my last customer visit in Shanghai. When I boarded the plane bound for Shanghai, I saw many business travellers boarding the planes with cakes and gifts for their clients or maybe their loved ones. As a InDIYpendent, I simply place my cake orders from a portal and they delivered to my hotel. So simple. No sweat.$$The advanced in technology has made travelling a less-hassle, enjoy our favourite food as and when we want and also time-saving when it comes to shopping and grocery buying. This was not even possible 5 years ago and we can see how fast technology has progress to enable us to lead a fuss-free life. What i envision in 2030 to be more convenient and faster than the current technology just like those in superheroes movie XD$$1. Like and share THIS post
2. Technology has made life more flexible. We can now order food online and have it delivered to our homes. Video Chat with family from oversea. It is like they are just next to us. And we no longer need to go to the library or book store to get the books we love. Just dowload the ebook for your reading pleasure anywhere and any time.$$The convenience technology has provided us can be felt not just by customers, but also by those working in the f&b line. Taking of orders used to be by paper and pen, which is not just troublesome and time consuming, and order papers could be easily lost or destroyed. But now with technology, we can easily key in the orders into the cashier and immediately both service and kitchen would have machines churning out the orders without mistake through wireless internet. And now customers can get their food and be happy B| 
(liked and shared~)$$technology has made life more flexible in three ways. 
one, when i am stuck in a deserted toilet with no toilet paper i no longer have to use my socks or wait 300 years for someone to come, i can just call someone with my handphone to come down with supplies.
two, when i am the loner at the party i no longer have to stare around awkwardly, i can whip out my phone and pretend i have a life and so many people are messaging me oh gosh.
three, when i see all the cool new phones and lappies i gotta catch em all so technology has given me new and innovative ways to become a poor and bankrupt student.$$Long long time ago when I was in my late teens and early twenties, I have many friends who broke up because one partner is going overseas to study. A few more years down the road came msn then Skype and now FaceTime. If they are born in this era, they wouldn't need to break up la. They have the flexibility to video call on PC/ Laptop or FaceTime/message/call using various phone apps. Technology have saved many ‚ù§Ô∏èrelationships‚ù§Ô∏è.$$Liked & shared! Technology make my life wonderful and handphone is the best invention. Handphone is a great companion, a BFF. Whenever I feel bored, I can play games with it, watch movies with it and listen music with it. My life becomes colourful and all my troubles are waived off.$$Liked & shared! Technology make my life more flexible and convenient when I am hungry and need for food I can simply call for delivery without even stepping out of my house! I can contact my friends with Watapp on mobile phone and stay in touch with friends through Facebook and messenger! No more letter writing which take time to reach my friends save on paper and effortlessly to stay in touch! Tagging Jennifer Ong Boon Chye$$I love how technology allows and helps me in communicating with people on the other side of the world. I would look forward to every night as i would be able to video call my mom as she moved to Thailand. We would talk about everything and anything HAHAHA it almost felt like we were side by side and things were the same like when i was a little kid. I am kind of an awkward potato andddddd im an introvert. I used to bury my head in books and not socialize with people of my age but playing online games has helped me out tremendously as it made me feel comfortable talking to strangers and connect with people from other parts of the world. From chatting behind a computer screen and slowly to video chatting with my best friend from maplestory. She has helped me to become a more social person and made me feel comfortable in my skin because I was made fun of alot in school and was an outcast. But, she was there for me and I would always look forward to going home and pouring my emotions out to her. She was a good listener. She taught me to create a blog and let me share about my life experiences. I'm so glad technology was invented and really glad that i have met my first true friend :)$$Technology has made life so much more flexible in so many ways. Communication is one of the aspects that have become much more convenient. Previously, once the date and time have been fixed, it is hard to change it at the very last minute. With smartphones, we can now create group chats and update everyone on the date and time to meet with a simple message. Also, it has allowed many cross-border exchanges, be it travelling or business deals, and strangers, friends and even families are able to connect despite being in different countries.

Liked and shared the post! :)$$I remember when we used to enter contests by tearing out pages from magazines/newspapers and mailing them by postage to the company's office, and we receive our prize through mailing too! Now with technology, we just need to ""like and share"" and most of the prizes are e-vouchers which is convenient! :)$$Press a button, money transfer over. Press another button food flies over. So shiok! We are very fortunate to be living in this era, everything got shortcuts now. Heng ah! I'm sure in the years ahead, we will see revolutionary changes in the way we lead our lives. Look forward to more exciting developments in the next generation of technological advancements. Hope I can still keep up with it in my 60s, 70s... :) Our lives will be more intertwined with technology!$$Technology has made my life easier and more convenient. From online banking to online shopping to ordering your taxi from your smart device. All it takes is a push of a button and sometimes you may not even have to own a credit card to enjoy having everything sent to your doorstep. Yes, some shops accepts COD! :-) But what I love most about these modern conveniences is that I get to spend more time with my kids and husband. The time supposed to be spent in walking to Sheng Siong and hauling 30 kilos of grocery with 2 howling kids in tow is now better spent playing catch in the park or watching movies at home with my feet propped up. Other than that, I am on extended maternity leave because I can work from home and submit my reports online. How cool is that? Perhaps I will order that chicken rice from that flying boat after all. Kristina OngDee Kaytee Polyndevilla Vic Peng$$Technology has definitely made life more flexible by allowing me to order fast food like MacDonald's, Pizza Hut, KFC etc with the click of my hand. It totally helps when I stranded at home with 2 little ones. 

Liked n shared!$$As Singaporeans, we love our food as much as we love our choices. With the advancements in technology, not only has our food become more delicious, dining has become more fun as well.

For instance, many would agree that having sushi off the conveyor belt not only allows us to dine at our own pace, the myriad of choices is also part of the fun. 

Having Korean BBQ wouldn't be as fun if the meat came to your table properly grilled as opposed to cooking it to your desired doneness, thanks to technology that makes it possible for diners to grill the meat and eat it right after.

And what about designing your own fluffy pancakes from bottles of pre-coloured pancake batter? 

All these dining experiences would not have been possible if technology did not exist - no longer do we need to prepare food beforehand before sitting down to a meal with friends or family - with technology, even the cooking can be an activity that bonds people.

We cannot deny that the future of food is closely linked with the advancement in technology. After all, one day we may be able to have our meals in a self-driving vehicle while taking in the beautiful scenery - life does not get more flexible than that. ;)$$Technology made our lives easier by allowing us to read almost everything and anywhere via our smartphones, so now I can just read stories and articles (esp thesmartlocal articlea :P) on the go!",2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
