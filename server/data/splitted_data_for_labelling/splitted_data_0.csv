Big thanks to everyone for participating, and to Quayside Isle for sponsoring this giveaway :)$$10 Reasons I would like to spend Christmas at Quayside Isle!

1. It's my birthday on Christmas!
2. I could never have a fancy meal around because everything is so expensive on Christmas!
3. I was actually intending to save some money this Christmas by staying at home so the husband don't have to spend so much..
4. As we are saving money for our future flat and can't afford a holiday..
5. Hence travelling to Quayside Isle could be like a 'getaway' from Singapore!
6. I have NEVER been to this side of Singapore....
7. And since I don't have a car and am saving money.. The transportation accommodation is perfect!
8. I've never splurge on fanciful Italian, Spanish or any International fare - Closest was vouchers from friends at Lawry's Prime Ribs.
9. Have you seen Rebel Wilson did that Hydro Jetpack thing?!
10. I REALLY WANNA WIN THIS! 😭$$My QUAY reason is that it's a nice tranquil place to spend Christmas with family by my SIDE and therefore ISLE really like to go there!$$With Quayside Isle being such a Instagram-worthy place, the ""ulu"" distance ain't gonna stop me from going because we all know it's definitely WORTH IT! And why squeeze at Orchard Road when we can get to experience Xmas from all over the world at Quayside Isle, right?? Haha :D Plus the Xmas promotions & shopping...OMG it's literally the perfect mini getaway! Oh! And my family had a staycation at W last year; waking up to that insanely gorgeous yacht sea view was seriously a dream come true! Sentosa is always my happy place to be, which is why I'd LOVE to be able to spend Xmas at Quayside Isle this year!! There's just no other place I'd rather be!! :D Liked & shared! (Here's some photos that I took when I was at Quayside Isle! Now I miss this beautiful place so so much!) TheSmartLocal.com Quayside Isle @ Sentosa Cove$$I think it would be great to celebrate Christmas at Quayside Isle instead of the usual Orchard.  I love the sea, boats and beautiful scenery where I can take alot of nice selfes and wefies.  Would invite my Malaysian cousins for some delicious food  when they come to visit in Christmas. I'm sure they will love in love with the lovely place.  :D 
liked n shared$$I have not been to the  Quayside Isle before so it would great to have brand new experience this year  to create new memories with my loved one                 :3 
liked n shared$$Having been to Quayside isle several times , it is unlike like any other places Singapore , always packed and crowded with people . Having no time to travel out of Singapore during the xmas season, quayside isle is the best place to be at , to celebrate the festive season with our love ones, which will give us a out of Singapore feel.$$I hope to win this vouchers at Quayside Isle vouchers 😍 

I have never been to Quayside and I never thought it is so beautiful and less crowded as compared to town areas (especially during Christmas). Both my boyfriend and I hated squeezing in the crowd! It would be a great idea to spend my Christmas with my boyfriend Chua Hien Eng there which gives us the feeling of being out of Singapore during this festive season! As its really expensive to travel overseas during this festive season. With the awesome view, we can take many Instagram worthy photos together and have our mini photo shoot there! It would be great walking along Quayside Isle together hand in hand and spending quality time together. I believe this would be a great place for us to escape from our hectic life ☺️$$Liked n shared . It's a different part of Singapore ... Where one can relax and chill away from the hustle and bustle of the city and the marina and yachts docked by Quayside isle bring waterfront to a whole different level !$$I’d like to spend Christmas at Quayside Isle because I have not been to this place, and it would be great to bring my wife to  Quayside Isle for a change in environment too. This place may bring new surprises to us.$$I'd like to spend this Christmas with our little one who will be turning 2 months soon. This would be his first Christmas! 

It would be lovely to spend it at Quayside Isle as a family. To enjoy the evening by having a sumptuous dinner & dessert in one of the restaurants and take a stroll along the quay afterwards for some photo taking time!

Let's hope to be chosen and make this first Christmas a special one for us, the Wongs :) 😘
Kyle Wong 
Ho Eleanor Ron Chng Pearly Ling Choo Ang Galvin Ng Lin Guan$$Its the perfect and tranquil place to spend the Christmas Eve over at Quayside Isle along with my significant other. Where we could just simply people watch or chat to our hearts content over what we had achieved in the year by the night lights and stars above.  Ahhhh~ I am so tempted to rush down just by the thought of it. Hope luck is on my side so that I can win the vouchers and truly enjoy my sumptuous dinner at any of the restaurant. Jonathan Tan😘$$Because its a serene enclave from the hustle and bustle of the city and with paranomic views of the sea along with tantalising delights which I simply can't resist, why else but Quayside Isle right? :) 

P.S: Wasn't paid by CDL or its tenants to say this.$$Christmas has always been mundane/just-another-day for us since we never liked joining the crowds. Thus, I believe Quayside Isle is THE place to go if we'd like to enjoy some quiet time and soak in the Christmas festive at the same time!$$Spent a month working here during my post-As last year, and told myself i'd definitely be back - only this time to enjoy the gorgeous seaview with my family. But when uni started, i got carried away with the assignments, projects, hall commitments and suppers, and haven't been to quayside isle since. It's a year late but i'll be bringing them this dec, and it'll be really, really amazing if i could treat them to a good meal by the sea (freshly made, piping hot pizza? yes pls!!!) it'd be the perfect christmas getaway for us!!$$I had been to Quayside Isle before,it is so nice like overseas.The scenery is nice with sea,boata and nice scenery.I can take alot of nice pictures.$$Liked and shared
Hope to win can bring my wife and kids celebrate Christmas n my early birthday at a nice scenery and less crowded place.As bringing kids to crowded place inconvenient too.$$All I want for Christmas is to spend more time with my family and daughter. 

As a busy working mother,  ive definitely missed out on the time i spend with my family and missing some milestones achieved by my daughter. But when I come home, my daughter will run to the door and give me a big hug, and everything that's happened that day just melts away. We love food from Quayside Fish Bar & Bistro so it'll be great to have a party this Christmas at Quayside Isle @ Sentosa Cove
Liked and shared$$I love to bring my mother to have a wonderful time at the Quayside Isle.  Ever since she discharged from hospital, she has been at home and feeling bored so I like to treat her to a yummy meal and walk around the beautiful place and take some nice photos <3$$I’d like to spend Christmas with my husband at Quayside Isle because it's a beautiful and romantic place, especially during the Christmas season. The dining options look good too.$$A promise to a special someone: To keep her smiling everyday. To bring her experiences and memories that will last a lifetime. To keep the sparks and magic alive in every date. 

Celebrating Christmas at Quayside Isle is my next milestone to meeting this promise. Help me fulfill it.$$I’d like to spend Christmas at Quayside Isle because it's definitely a better alternative compared to the crowded town area. Other than feeling like you are outta Singapore, having a quieter Christmas will be good. :)$$There was once where my wife and I were ""stuck"" among the crowds at Orchard Road during Christmas day. It was a horrible experience.So now, we would rather spend a quiet and peaceful Christmas day together at home. We did not know of any happening events at Quayside Isle, and also the place is quite far from our home and may be a little too quiet for us. I am looking for some place new for us to visit and after reading the website, I'm keen to go there for our Christmas celebration this year. It seems like a secret place hidden in Singapore with gems inside!$$I would like to spend this Christmas at Quayside Isle as it would be an unique experience for my friends and I. We usually hang out in bars or pubs and after so many years, it is time for a change. A different and exotic silent night!

Esther L Chng Joy Yeo$$I didn't know Quayside Isle was that pretty until I have read your blog, it just don't look at Singapore, a perfect mini getaway.

Offers its program to eliminate the surface and underground earthquakes, stopping forest fires, forest conservation, and restoration of water balance of Indonesia.
Restoring the first option - reducing the number and power of earthquakes.
Forest fire prevention and forest restoration.
Restoration of water balance of Indonesia.
The first earthquake. This is a very serious work, and it may seem impossible. It is not correct and effective solutions there. Quote: ""Indonesia is one of the most seismically active zone of the planet and is part of the"" Pacific Ring of Fire ""- a powerful tectonic break. Annually seismologists recorded in Indonesia around 7000 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0 on the Richter scale. ""
Is it possible to reduce the number of earthquakes in Indonesia and to reduce their power?
Can.
Mountain formation, adjacent lithosphere and the tectonic plates were many thousands of years before the warming in a static state. It is known that all crystalline body expands when heated. Take two bricks to hold them together metal strip, and will be heated. According to the law: solid body expands when heated, bricks expand and collapse. That is what happened in Indonesia, when 250 thousand people were killed by the tsunami. Scientists: ""The joints of two adjacent slabs could not stand the load, collapsed - and one plate dove under the other."" And there are, or smaller joints in Indonesia and around - many thousands.
Treatment of the first stage. Cooling sushi Indonesia, and water in the surrounding seas. Terms reduce the amount of power and ground and underground earthquake and tsunami - at 15% per year. The second and third stages will give later.
Second. Termination of forest fires due to litter moisture: dry last year's grass, fallen leaves, dead twigs, and the restoration of forest coolness and dampness. And much more.
Third. Restoration of water balance. This is the standard work on the production of drinking and irrigation water, but without it the temperature rise and evaporation impossible to do. Emphasizing that crystal clear drinking water will provide hospitals, schools, pre-schools in the big cities. Clean water will ensure growth in its net production to tourist facilities, and will provide a significant increase in the inflow of tourists.
Such proposals, Indonesia will not get from anyone, and all the disasters will increase and the number and power, and destroy the economy.
Visas to Indonesia me or managers are not needed. Better to call me as a specialist for three months. During that time I, or one of the managers of our bearings, and someone left who - no, but a visa is not the main thing.

Уважаемые руководители Индонезии! 
Предлагаю Вам свои программы по устранению наземных и подземных землетрясений, прекращения лесных пожаров, сохранение лесов, и восстановлению водного баланса Индонезии. 
Восстановление первого параметра – уменьшение количества и мощности землетрясений. 
Предотвращение лесных пожаров и восстановление лесов.
Восстановление водного баланса Индонезии. 
Первое, землетрясения. Это очень серьёзная работа, и может показаться невыполнимой. Это не так, правильные и эффективные решения есть. Цитата: «Индонезия находится в самой сейсмически активной зоне планеты и является частью «тихоокеанского огненного кольца» – мощного тектонического разлома. Ежегодно сейсмологи регистрируют в Индонезии около 7 тысяч землетрясений магнитудой выше 4,0 по шкале Рихтера.»
Можно ли уменьшить количество землетрясений в Индонезии и уменьшить их мощность? 
Можно. 
Горные образования, соседние литосферные и тектонические плиты многие тысячелетия находились до потепления в статическом состоянии. Известно, что все кристаллические тела при нагревании расширяются. Возьмём два кирпича, скрепим их металлической полосой, и будем нагревать. По закону: твёрдые тела при нагревании расширяются, кирпичи расширятся и разрушатся. Именно это случилось в Индонезии, когда от цунами погибло 250 тысяч человек. Учёные: «Стыки двух соседних плит не выдержали нагрузки, разрушились – и одна плита нырнула под другую.» А таких, или более мелких стыков в Индонезии и вокруг неё – многие тысячи. 
Лечение, первый этап. Охлаждение суши Индонезии, и воды в окружающих морях. Сроки уменьшения количества и мощности наземных и подземных землетрясений и цунами – по 15% в год. Второй и третий этапы дам позже.
Второй. Прекращение лесных пожаров за счёт увлажнения лесной подстилки: высохшей прошлогодней травы, опавших листьев, отмерших веточек, и восстановление в лесах прохлады и сырости. И многое другое.
Третье. Восстановление водного баланса. Это стандартная работа по производству питьевой и поливной воды, но без неё при росте температуры и испаряемости обойтись невозможно. Особо отмечу, что кристально чистая питьевая вода обеспечит больницы, школы, дошкольные учреждения в крупных городах. Чистая вода обеспечит рост на ней чистой продукции для туристических баз, и обеспечит значительны рост притока туристов.
Подобных предложений Индонезия не получат ни от кого, и все катаклизмы будут нарастать и по количеству и по мощности, и разрушать экономику.

1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
By which also ye are saved, if keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

ROMANS 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

1 JOHN 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

God loves you so very much:))

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

1JOHN 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye believe on the name of the Son of God.

God loves you so very much! All of us are sinners in this world who have sinned and rebelled against a holy righteous God and because of sin we have to face death one day. Sin is the reason we die.God came down to earth as a man in the flesh named Jesus Christ. Jesus became the light of the world to save sinners from their sins. Jesus died on the cross for your sins, shed all of his blood, was buried, and rose again three days later, according to the scriptures. He took your place of punishment for your sins so if you truly believe in your heart on Jesus and all that he did for you and put your faith and trust in his blood that was shed for your sins and trust in all he did for you on the cross, you may know that you have everlasting life and you will be saved the very moment you truly believe in your heart. God sees the heart of man. Will you believe on Jesus Christ today with all of your heart and trust on him and the shed blood that was shed for your sins?

Jesus is God manifested in the flesh!!!

JOHN 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

JOHN 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to heaven! There is no other way. No man, priest, pastor, church, religion, works, baptism, nothing but through Jesus Christ!

JOHN 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

ACTS 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

JOHN 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

1 PETER 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

We are all sinners and we are going to die one day and need to be saved from our sins to go to heaven

ROMANS 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.

ROMANS 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

ROMANS 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROMANS 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

We are saved ONLY by GOD'S GRACE!

EPHESIANS 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

ROMANS 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

REPENT, turn to Jesus Christ, put your faith and trust in him alone, truly believe on him and all he did for you.

JOHN 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

MARK 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

EPHESIANS 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise,

When you truly believe on Jesus with all of your heart call upon him from your heart..Salvation is a heart decision and comes from the heart.

ROMANS 10: 9-13 If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

The very second you BELIEVE in your heart on Jesus Christ and all he did for you on the cross for your sins cause God sees your heart and call upon the name of the Lord from your heart you will be saved.

Check out a few of his posts... he posts on a variety of subjects.$$I think the issue of sometimes critical opinions regarding america is something any expat of their country is bound to do with the country they've moved to. You notice a number of things- changes in courtesies, changes in formalities, food, discrimination, the list goes on. We went through this a lot in japan as exchange students- we had people that didn't want to sit next to us on occasion on the train, no one holds open doors in Japan (not out of an effort to be rude, but just because it's not part of their common courtesy), american versions of food outside of mcdonalds and hard rock were usually hilariously wrong, etc. We became very critical of Japan, not because we didn't like it there (we LOVED it there- many of my friends are already back), but because in talking through the harsh realities, it helped us cope and adjust to the differences. Many of our Japanese friends were slightly shocked at our perspectives on occasion, but they couldn't deny that there wasn't any truth to it. The Korea seems to do the same sort of thing, except this time the foreign country is america and america is full of changes he has to be critical of to understand and cope and adapt to. Perhaps I'm more understanding because I know where he's coming from, but instead of seeing it as a personal attack (which is far from what he probably intends), see it as an alternate perspective of someone who hasn't been ingrained in american culture since birth and therefore has a fresh perspective on perhaps some of the more harsher realities of living here. :)$$@Mary: Very insightful! I've seen both sides of it...people for the USA being very critical of Korea and many Koreans being critical of the USA. I think you may have hit the nail on the head...more than anything it may be a way to fit a new culture into their mindset more than an actual attack. However...there definitely is a limit too. I guess a lot depends on not just WHAT is said, but HOW it is said!$$^I agree! There are of course things you shouldn't say, but I've not seen anything written in this blog that seemed to absolutely cross the line with this sort of cultural reaction. I HAVE seen people cross it, and it's pretty obvious when they do. And generally most critiques about a country are kept amongst those who are collectively together in the new environment, not shouted from the rooftops, haha. The only time I had japanese friends of mine hear me speak about my own critiques is when I had to speak to a group of out-going american exchange students about what not to do and what to expect when going to Japan.

How to Get There:
Fly into Zamboanga from Manila, Cebu or Davao.

Or take a boat to Zamboanga from Manila.

What is it?
A vinta's sail is made up of vertical stripes of assorted colors that represent the colorful history of the peninsula's Muslim community. About a third of its population is made up of ethnic communities that give the region its unique flavor. These include the Tausugs, Samals, Yakans, Badjaos, and Subanens. Wait until you start hearing the people speak Chabacano – arguably the suavest-sounding dialect because of its heavy Spanish influence.

Fun Fact:
Vinta is also the name of a Moro dance performed to commemorate the migration of the Filipinos. Dancers imitate the movement of the vintas by balancing on the tops of poles.

http://mustsharenews.com/wedding-angpow-rate/Here is why you should not feel pressured into giving a big red packet when you are attending a wedding dinner at a high-class place!","Red packets are a gift by the guest to the wedding couple. Don't turn it into a profit making business. It's your choice to choose an expensive location, it is my liberty to give a 'gift' that I can afford and reflecting my economic ability at the moment. It's a wedding invitation, not a Ticketed dinner event.$$Because Singaporean are being considerate as friends, neighbors and relatives. And because Singaporean fear losing ""Face Water"", some takes advantage of the situation. 

However, I have a friend (very wealthy himself) told his son (who was about to be married), do not expect the invited guests to keep up with amount in angpows since the wedding was held at top class hotel. And that should be rightfully so. Friends, neighbors and relatives should only present a wedding gifts they meant to be and affordable.$$Every couple wants the best,parents want to please relatives and friends to save face for themselves as well as for the newly web couple.
Remember the package include a lot of other expenses in which the Hotel/Restataunts/Event companies put in.
Actually based on the food alone it should not worth that much.
$800-$1000 is consider high.
So your red package should not be more than $280 per couple or $120 per person.
It is the real market rate.$$Well said.  It is a vicious cycle.  Give whatever you feel comfortable in giving as it is only a blessing and not fair for you to foot the couple's wedding dinner bill. 

Anyway, nowadays, eating less is more healthy. I suggest consider a 4 course dinner instead of a 8 course dinner will halve the cost of hosting the event or consider a buffet,  $10 per pax can help stretch $5,000 to feed 500 guests or 50 tables.$$If you do not have a big head, please do not attempt to wear a big hat which doesn't fit.

The bridge looks the same, and there is water on both sides of where they are sitting so it seems to be the east side.  The large bridge behind them and the bridge that he crosses are the same as on this island.

The former Braddell-Westlake Secondary School has been abandoned since 2005, and as with abandoned places, eerie vibes here are at an all-time high.  The amazing thing about this place? Unlike most abandoned places, the gates here are opened with the disclaimer ""Enter at your own risk"" instead of ""Trespassers will be prosecuted."" Yay!

Graffitied walls, shattered windows and dusty floors are a dead giveaway on this place’s inhabitants. Or lack thereof. One more desolated location to check off your photography bucket list!

For other people, pens with either Korean scene or Korean money (won) an alternative could be drink coasters. Be the reds t-shirt or bandana, magnets of people in hanboks or little cloth phone charms which can also double as Xmas tree deorations, chopsticks or placemat sets, traditional pencil cases are good for children.

""Last year, I had the chance to travel to Batanes with my friend, and the chance to experience Itbayat was a big tick off my travel bucket list. There we met Nanay Cano, a resident who operates a small lodging house. She is a retired teacher who also used to be a tourism officer in Itbayat. She fondly shared with us stories how she managed to juggle both responsibilities back in the day and how her love of Itbayat made it light for her to attend to her duties.

What is it like? 
When fish swim in the same direction and in a coordinated manner, the behavior is called ""schooling."" But when they're together, interacting, it's called ""shoaling"". Fish shoal for protection against predators, better chances of finding food, and better chances of finding a mate – a shoalmate! You can watch schools or shoals of fish when you go snorkeling in Puerto Princesa's marine attractions, such as Honda Bay.

Fun Fact: 
Fish don't just randomly join a group. Like people, they pick who to hang out with – who their mates will be. And generally, they like large shoals with fish who are healthy and resemble their appearance. This is because a fish that stands out will be easy prey.

But I question whether the majority of citizens here would be comfortable with the relationship if they knew of the horrors inflicted on hundreds of thousands of dogs in South Korea on barbaric ‘meat dog’ farms. 
In South Korea, thousands of dogs are kept crammed in filthy metal cages. They’re fed on the carcasses of other dead dogs, and they’re deeply distressed from a combination of boredom and terror. 
It is the middle of a South Korean winter, there are dogs shivering and whimpering in freezing, open cages. They live their entire lives in factory farm conditions. They have no freedom, no affection, nothing that makes them feel good. And they’ll be butchered so humans can eat their meat. I have heard of the atrocities—of dogs and cats being boiled alive. Of dogs being baked. Of family dogs being stolen and cooked. The fact that people know this happens and turns a blind eye is not acceptable. To do this is to condone the dog meat trade. It is despicable and one of the basest practices that happens as an industry on this planet. 
As Mahatma Gandhi once said, “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.”
I ask that your publication bring attention to two important issues: 
•	the existence of the dog meat trade in South Korea

Carrying one's heavy pack along with the items of the rest of the group throughout the duration of the trek, which could last up to 10 or more hours per day depending on the trail, is something mountain guides and porters are willing to sacrifice for in exchange for a better source of income.

Where majority of our provincial lands' main source of livelihood rest in farming or fishing, most of these guides go back to such labor when they have no group to guide in the mountains.

But being a guide can earn four to five times more than what one can earn from fishing or farming in a day, and that is why they are willing to make the sacrifice and even eager to do so. At night in the campsite, they take shots of local rum, not to get drunk, but to ease their bodies from the pain and protect themselves from the cold. 

With better accessibility to the mountains, locals who lead groups visiting as guides or as porters, certainly have a better chance of living, and more money to feed their families.

We shouldn't take it against them for making a decent living out of being a guide or a porter. While there are those local communities who sadly and unfortunately abuse this opportunity, there are still those who do not and are very adamant about providing job opportunities for the locals while at the same time preserving the natural habitat of the mountains in their community.

From among these are the guides I met in Kanlaon Volcano in Negros. They limit climbers to 10 per day and require permits for any mountaineer visiting. They uphold the model for responsible mountaineering.

I heard that Bird's Nest are good for nourishing lungs, but never knew it can regulate hormones as well!

The best way to describe the Beatiful Destinations team is they represent a sector of travel that is very adventurous. They like to go where people have never been before. They like to look at familiar places from a very unfamiliar attitude. So what they're saying is, this is what is the most incredible experiences that they've had. Now the advantage of this is, because of their unique perspective, they're sending out images of the Philippines that even we have never seen before, at least from the perspective that they have. And that's a tremendous boost for us.Are you following Beautiful Destinations on Instagram and Facebook? You should be. They just visited the Philippines! Our chief correspondent Pia Hontiveros speaks to the Beautiful Destinations team and to Tourism Secretary Mon Jimenez.","good move for our Tourism agency. :)$$It's great that so many more people are appreciating the Philippines I only hope that the boom does not damage / destroy the natural beauty.$$Good job Sec Jimenez!!

With this awesome xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger, there will be no more hogging to the power supplies! :)$$I would love to gift the xPower WC3QT travel charger to my boyfriend as he often charges his devices (laptop and especially phone as he always play game)! It's important that he gets all his devices charged up and be ready for both school and work, and also when we travel together at a later time of this year! Since he's such a forgetful person, this multi-functional charger would benefit him a lot!$$I m always lugging around 3 portable batteries as I need to charge my iPhone and iPad! Please rescue my shoulders as they are aching everyday from the load I carry. I need xPower DC5S Charger to charge my iPad, my phone and my portable fan to keep me from fainting in this heatwave.$$The xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save my life because my phone's battery life is quite short. It would definitely need a mid-day charge if im using it actively as my GPS$$I think the xPower PB10Q Power Bank would be very apt to save my life from a dead phone. It's less a question of need but one of want, as my current portable charger is good for one charge and is the size of a KitKat. So this is less of an entry into a lucky draw, but more of a plea for a better, longer, phone life. PLEEEEEEAAAASSSEEEE$$xPower DC5S Charger will save my life whenever I'm overseas cos the number of available sockets in hotel rooms are either too far apart till my items are everywhere or there are simply not enough sockets for me to charge my phone/dslr battery/portable charger. With this, at least I can consolidate all my tech devices together without having to worry about leaving one behind! :)$$Liked & shared. I hope I can win the xPower DC5S Charger as I'll be going overseas next month & my family of 4 will be squeezing in one hotel room! This means that we need to fight for the electrical sockets to charge our devices when we reached back in our hotel room. So it would be perfect to owe the xPower DC5S Charger to increase the efficiency by charging so many our devices at the same time! Furthermore, the added advantage of the xPower DC5S Charger is that it comes with a removable handphone stand so that our devices will not be wandering around and we can save the hassle of finding them! :-)$$Liked and shared!

I definitely need the xPower DC5S Power, though it's a close fight with   xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger.

Given that I usually travel with someone else, getting enough power points for our numerous gadgets is a massive headache.

Count this: Camera (ok, not fair to count it cos it doesn't use USB but it does take up one power point on its own), portable power bank, phone, tablet, smart watch, and iPod (yes, I'm old skool... Cos I don't wanna drain my phone's batt.) and then multiply by the number of travelers and you roughly get the idea of how many power points we will need if not for the multi-USB charger. I can bring my own travel adaptor for just one charger and that's it.

Wei Ling Bimira, you'll agree...$$xPower DC5S Charger will definitely be a life-saver, not only for myself, but for fellow travellers in my group, especially on long road trips with no power source in sight. =)$$Item: the xPower PB10Q Power Bank. I need it to charge my phone whenever it runs out of battery whilst im overseas. Caused me to not be able to take photos and even, record beautiful moments.$$xPower PB10Q Power Bank will be my life saver!
I'm a heavy phone user and can't last a few hours without my phone!

Liked and shared$$xPower PB10Q Power Bank will be my life saviour because I am a very heavy phone user and i would die without it hahahaha$$xPower DC5S Charger save all of us life when we go camping or travel around.. we can charges all of our gadgets at the same time.

Philippines. Staring contests. More fun in the. Philippines. Going with the flow. More fun in the. Philippines. Beaches. Openbars. More fun in the ..The Philippines , officially known as the Republic of the Philippines , is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. To its north across the Luzon Strait lies Taiwan; west across the South China Sea sits Vietnam; southwest is the island of Borneo across the Sulu Sea, and to the south the Celebes Sea separates it from other islands of Indonesia; while to the east it is bounded by the Philippine Sea and the island-nation of Palau. Its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator make the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons, but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world’s greatest biodiversity. At 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 sq mi), the Philippines is the 64th-largest country in the world, consisting of an archipelago of 7,107 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Its capital city is Manila while its most populous city is Quezon City; both are part of Metro Manila.With a population of at least 99 million people, the Philippines is the seventh-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world. An additional 12 million Filipinos live overseas, comprising one of the world’s largest and most influential diasporas. Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands. In prehistoric times, Negritos were some of the archipelago’s earliest inhabitants. They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples who came from Malay, Indian, and Islamic states. Various nations were established under the rule of Datus, Rajahs, Sultans or Lakans. Trade with China also introduced Chinese culture and settlement, which remain present to this day.The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 marked the beginning of an era of Spanish interest and eventual colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. The Spanish Empire began to settle with the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi from New Spain (present day Mexico) in 1565 who established the first Spanish settlement in the archipelago, which remained a Spanish colony for more than 300 years. This resulted in the predominant religion in the country to be Roman Catholicism and it is one of two countries in Asia; the other being East Timor. During this time, Manila became the Asian hub of the Manila–Acapulco galleon trade.As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution, which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic; the Spanish–American War; and the Philippine–American War. In the aftermath, the United States emerged as the dominant power; aside from the period of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands. After World War II, the Treaty of Manila recognised the Philippine Republic as an independent nation. Since then, the Philippines has had an often tumultuous experience with democracy, with popular “people power” movements overthrowing a dictatorship in one instance, but also underlining the institutional weaknesses of its constitutional republic in others. The Philippines currently has one of Asia’s fastest growing economies, and the nation’s large population size and economic potential have led it to be classified as a middle power.$$yes !

I think KTO should provide more informations about unfamiliar places in Korea. And also for guide how to get there,, food and accomodation available there, and maybe some activities availabe. And it should be great if KTO provide some informations about the transportation, such where can we rent a van or a bus for trip :) last summer break, we had gone for a really enjoyable trip because of informations provided in KTO 💜💜 thank u KTO :D So i hope to see others to enjoy their trip during their stay at Korea too like me n friends. $$For me both A. Photo/video-oriented content and B. Information-oriented content, because these can easily captivate or fascinate the interest of the excursionist or rubbernecker. They are both functional especially to me as non native because during my free time here in Korea, KTO page will be my guide in exploring interesting and beautiful places were in photos, videos and information about the places that can be seen in Korea will help in motivating us because it will be delivered complex information through a real life context. Kamsahamnida Korea Tourism Organization$$I think both. A. Photo/Video - oriented content, and B. Information - oriented  content. 

     They are same useful and very effective way to attract  travelers to visit a place like Jeju island, Seoul Namsan tower, Suwon Hwaseong Fotress and other tourist destination  or to go around the city like Seoul, Incheon, Busan and other places in Korea by using transportation system  like bus, subway, taxi and other mode of transportation or going to event and festival or want to taste korean food specially kimchi. Both content  with specific details it really makes help to the travellers to explore more about Korea and to go in a place/tourist destination with a organize plan and schedules.

     Base on my experience i always  love to visit a place with a brief knowledge about the place and specially always inspire me a lot to visit a place where i'm going on.

     So for me my answer are A and B content, i would like to see both content on KTO page and the combination of two it would be great. Because they are same important and informative. 

     Thank you...$$B) information abt budget tips at korea etc food,accomodation, transport..tips for those like to stay longer at korea like work or study and more info abt halal food..$$For me the two categories A and B are important because the information be explained strengthen it when the image or video
Where the image or video simplifies and explains the information-oriented reader also helps is weak in the language of the arrival of the information picture him speak in turn. Also, image or video will be more pronounced if the crisis has strengthened the information
For example, when we talk about halal food safety we have to mention that these foods are sold and be nice when we put some pictures of halal food, and how progress will be delicious and also the tourist will go to him easily.
Since it is a page-oriented tourists must be guide with pictures and information that make it easier for tourists to visit the site, which is the image.$$B. I would like to see more of the information-oriented content.$$Dear Korea Tourism Organisation India Would Like to hear B) information abt tips at korea etc Transportation , food ( Resturants ,Cafe ) ,Attractions , Accomodation tips$$Dear   Korea Tourism Organisation India    Would Like to hear B) information abt tips at korea etc Transportation , food ( Resturants ,Cafe ) ,Attractions , Accomodation tips$$B) information on where to find elevators on the subway, stations and which exits.$$b) It would be nice to get to know more about Korean food and foreign food in korea.

I would like to see more information about low-key places (i.e. restaurants, cafes, events, etc). Korea is so densely filled with things to do, places to eat, and things to see--many unknown wonders are buried underneath the too-oftenly-blogged-about/regurgitated places that one can find on many other sites. In other words, I'd like to learn more about the unfrequented gems of Korea.$$I'd like to see more info about contemporary Korean literature(with translation too:) ) ... and the Korean countryside too like specific places to stay at, how it's like to live in a rural setting, and camping in the countryside. ^^$$For me I wanna read more information about tourist attraction and food for my experience. So I can guide to my friends too.^^$$I would like to see more of a) Photo/video-oriented content. I would like to see videos of attractions and restaurants and the street food culture in Korea.

Because we as a foreigner will be interested first when we see a beautiful or amazing photos/videos. And then when we already like the photos/videos we of course will search the information about that photos/videos. And the contents of both options I think is everything about Korea's charm. When KTO give information bout Korean food we would like to know about where it sales too and how to got there. Because I think every aspects are realated. So, it will be very great to have KTO give both of options.  Thanks$$My answer is  ""A"" but I would love to see videos where we can find information too :)$$Congrats for everything you did and you do! I really enjoy the new website about the medical tourism!

I'm in a cafe in Bojeongdong, I know that much, but whether it's cafe street or not, no idea. For others who wanna go, the directions say go out exit 1 and go behind Emart. Well, when you exit 1 at Jukjeon station, go to the right. you cannot go straight. I was lost around there for a bit because that exit goes in two directions. You cannot see E-mart because the Shinsegae dept. store is blocking your view. Anyway, go right toward Shingsegae and once you pass it, you will see Emart. Going ""behind Emart"" means turn right once you hit the corner where Emart is. After that I had to use my GPS to figure out where I was going. I think I'm still lost lol.

Apo Island, Negros Oriental

What is it?
Both a volcanic island and a marine reserve, this island has become a favorite diving destination in the southern Philippines. Its most popular site is Coconut, where sea turtles and sea snakes are regulars. But the spotlight belongs to the small-bodied white tip reef sharks which only grow up to five feet long.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Dumaguete.

Or take a bus from Cebu to Oslob, then take the Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry to Dumaguete.

Then take a bus from Dumaguete to Zamboanguita, and transfer to an outrigger boat to take you to Apo Island.

If you fancy corals, you’ll love this place. Most of the country’s 400+ species can be found in this small space.

Taman Sari consisted of four distinct areas: a large artificial lake with islands and pavilions located in the west, a bathing complex in the centre, a complex of pavilions and pools in the south, and a smaller lake in the east. Today only the central bathing complex is well preserved, while the other areas have been largely occupied by the Kampung Taman settlement.

Inextricably linked with the history of Sikhism, Amritsar is amongst the most revered sites of the world. It was founded as recently as the 16th century. Its name is a derivative of the Amrit Sarovar (pool of nectar) amidst which stands the Golden Temple, the most sacred of Sikh shrines. Accounts suggest that Guru Amardas purchased the land from Emperor Akbar and decided to build a tank at the site. Following his death, it was completed by Guru Ramdas and also came to be known as Chak Ramdas or Guru ka Chak. Some of the oldest markets in Amritsar, notably Guru ka Bazaar, date back to his time. The construction of the Golden Temple was initiated by Guru Arjan Dev while Guru Hargobind, who accorded the religion a martial temper, built the Akal Takht in 1606. Amritsar has a rich history encompassing various mythical and historical narratives including the epic Ramayana. It is believed that the site called Ram Tirath was Maharish Valmiki’s ashram, where Sita reportedly gave birth to her twin sons, Luv and Kush. The Gobindgarh Fort and Ram Bagh were built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire. While the Jallianwala Bagh continues to be the most evocative monument to India’s freedom struggle. The Khalsa College, established by visionary leaders at the beginning of the 20th century turned Amritsar into a hub of education. Also a centre of thriving industry since its inception, Amritsar is famed for its textiles, particularly shawls, and for its carpets. Amritsar has gained tremendous popularity for its gourmet traditions; especially the dhabas (roadside eatery) that churn out, amongst an inexhaustible list of delicacies, irresistible kulchas, chola-bhaturas, tandoori chicken and fried fish. Amritsar has all the makings of a well-rounded tourist destination; its ancient legends, historical monuments, places of worship, old bazaars, theatre traditions and colourful festivals all serve as a window to its robust past. Excursions to the Harike Bird Sanctuary and visits to the India-Pakistan border at Wagah are an absolute delight, while breaking bread or celebrating Diwali with the denizens of this hospitable city is without parallel.(Courtesy Punjab Tourism) ","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwoKgR0ZwMI$$Just for my friends living in India:

What is it?
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact:
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

But there are two sides to every coin and no-one or no race or culture is perfect. The corruption is terrible and stems from that other side of the coin - dishonesty and taking what is not rightfully yours.

As you are reading this letter, I bet that you have seen/heard about what happened earlier in our country.

Tourists were hostages of a policeman here, Rolando Mendoza. After a few hours of the horrible crime, some of the victims were dead including the hostage-taker.

I wrote this letter not just to apologize but also to let everyone know that we Filipinos are not all like Mendoza. We are loving and good-hearted people.

For so many years, our country has been standing tall and surpassing every dilemma; be it small or big. Years ago (back when I wasn’t born yet), you have watched us fight for what we think is right. We fought for the democracy of our nation.. The EDSA revolution. But that’s just one out of many.

Second. We Filipinos have been serving other countries for our families and we treat you as our own as well. With all due respect, I thank you all for giving us the trust through the years. For helping us to become what we are now.

The Philippines is more than just a group of islands. We are a nation of strong and remarkable people. A country of beauty and love known to be hospitable and well-valued. I humbly apologize for what happened tonight. No one in this world would want something like that to happen for life should be valued.

I politely ask the attention of the world. Please do not judge and mistreat us just because of what happened tonight. I have been searching the net and found terrible things. Hong Kong advices to avoid travels here, China and HK bans Filipinos and that Philippines is the worst place to go.

I can’t blame you for what you have decided but I hope that you could understand. Our country is now in a sea of problems. And I know for sure that we helped you in a way or another. Let peace and understanding reign this time.

I know that this letter will just be trash but I wish that you would understand. On behalf of the Philippine population.. WE ARE SORRY.$$FOR FREE !! to those from Hong Kong and Macao ! from now u can apply entry permit ""from the internet"" and then print it down, dispensing with NT 300, the period of validity of this entry permit application is three months long, and u can use it once for one month long staying Taiwan !

875,225524117535380_1177235242364258,"On Monday, we published a video on our YouTube channel in which some of us tried Indian Snacks from Little India. 

It was our intention to create a video celebrating Deepavali, but because of the poor execution of the video, we ended up offending a sizeable community of fellow Singaporeans.

The video should never have been produced and we removed it as soon as we realised our mistake.

The feedback we've received over the past 2 days have been vital in helping us identify our shortcomings. This is a big learning lesson we'll take with us moving forward.

We apologise again for this mistake and we will not be producing content like this again. ","That's okay! The video was made with good intentions. Stuff just went wrong along the way. But thanks for trying! 😊$$just in case some of you missed it. singaporeans try is the name of one of their show and they have others like pretty smart, talk on the street etc. it can be singaporeans try: indian snacks, singaporeans try: chinese snacks or singaporeans try: whatever. you get the idea. regardless whether it’s chinese, malay, indian or caucasian in the title, it is just an adjective. if you felt offended because it’s racist, it’s just like saying the statement, i feel like eating malay food for lunch, is racist. tell me how would you describe the snacks that they tried in the video? 

regarding the content, if one gives a blank look when asked about a festive celebration doesn’t equate to being racist. i vaguely remember TSL doing a video on chinese new year or some chinese festival and the participants(mostly chinese) have no clue to most of the questions asked. so are they dissing their own race? their videos are meant to create awareness for the mass and some comments have forced them to take it down. this has in turn taken away the opportunity that this video has for other to learn about snacks some of us don’t even know existed. i hope i did not step on anyone’s toe with this comment. TSL, don’t be discouraged by this incident. you guys have been doing a great job.$$Had been an avid fan of the smartlocals videos as they never fail to put a smile on people's faces with their quirky content.

I had the fortune or the misfortune of watching the video that has since been taken down. I must say that It is rather sad that content was created to make people laugh at the expense of a community.

Furthermore, it just highlights the blatant privilege that exists in Singapore, and I guess that privilege is widely abundant in the smart local as well.

This ultimately point to not only a failure of the system that allowed for the creation and release of such content, but the greater ignorance that must have been present in the organization.

I hope thesmartlocal will understand that Singapore is not only defined by it's ethnic majority and that the minority groups are also part of the community. We don't deserve to be treated like outsiders to be tasted, sampled and critiqued.$$I've come to love you guys a lot. Your videos are always sincere in nature with good local content. I did not managed to watch the video to actually decide if it is truly negative in nature. If it really is as what the social media is painting it to be, it really is out of character for you guys. I hope you guys can truly learn from this and continue to be the awesome content creator in YouTube.$$Combating racism by classifying everybody according to their race & encouraging professional victimhood. illiberal means of preventing free exchange of ideas. what trigger happy singaporeans.

Rather than be quick to remove said video, keep it online for everyone to watch, to encourage an open dialogue about race.$$Dear smart local, don't stop producing awesome stuff! We make mistakes in life. Gotta move forward. People fly off the hook so easily, you 跳进黄河也洗不清.$$Smart Local, I enjoy most of your contents, creative indeed. I have not seen the deepavali video, however, hope you guys can do another video with proper content and theme to cheer up deepavali. cheers$$For those wondering what was wrong with the video, this article explains it quite succinctly: http://mothership.sg/2016/10/the-smart-local-ruins-deepavali-for-sporean-indians-with-insensitive-racist-video/
Apart from the disdainful faces and comments, this line pretty much sums up why the video was so ridiculous: ""the most adverse connotation of the video was the treatment of Indians as if they are foreign to Singapore, to be sampled and passed judgement on.""$$Well guys, it's hard to not learn from it. Don't call food from someone else's culture diarrhea or anything along those lines ... 
and also... don't get ah lians (esp those with 0 sensitivity) for your videos please.$$If you were racist, apologise for your racism. Otherwise you're just missing the point and fucking up more. ""Poor execution""? Is a piss poor euphemism for what your video actually was, which was racist.$$When you have a team that is filled with Chinese majority, such ""incidents"" are the norms.

Nothing but toxic.$$TSL: so you are sorry because video was not good and poor execution and etc etc. that is why you are apologizing. But you are not sad and apologetic that you hurt the sentiments of a minority community who is as much Singaporean as others and you had audacity to just mock them and their culture and make fun or look down on them ???? How ironic, is that what your culture and values teaches you? Have you even thought if such thing would happen to you or your culture and cultural festivities then how angry, upset or sad you would feel ??? Food for thought for those on your team who could be so boldly racist, provocative and insensitive...even here in Singapore. Shame on such folks.$$This is was supposed to be a celebration of Diwali - the festival of all festivals for Indians. There is nothing celebratory about racism. This just made the divide between races That much clearer. The ignorance was sickening. I have no idea how you fathomed this was okay. Did you actually think this was funny? 

Apologise for your racist video. 
Own up to that. There is no going around the fact that this was blatantly racist.$$""Poor execution""? Why - was comparing Indian food to diarrhea meant to be said in interpretive dance?$$The word 'sorry' isn't even in here. This entire thing looks so corporate..like you know the general PR template used to fight fire. 

Apology Not personal enough really aka not sincere enough. Yet the video has hit a personal spot with the associated people.$$I did spot some flaws in the video but didnt think it would blow up. Was puzzled too they made a video abt Deepavali but I didnt spot any local Indian in the vid..$$how was such blatantly insulting content get through the editorial in the first place?! mind boggling! 😡 it's an insult to the wide spectrum of cultural diversity in Singapore that you don't deserve to claim to be so Smart about.$$You should re-upload it again. 
This time, to show proof and concrete evidence that Racism and Chinese Privilege still exist.$$I'm a huge fan of TSL, but really, this is so disappointing. This is exactly why you need an Indian in your team as well to avoid these kinda screw ups.$$I seriously think there has been an unnecessary hoohah over this video. TSL should not have deleted the video and let more people watch this and form their own opinion of it instead of succumbing to the few who watched and protested. In fact, thanks to this video, I learnt of a few Indian snacks which I have not heard of and I can't wait to try them. Give these kids a break. Peace, Out.$$Donovan, for goodness sake stop trying to promote your stupid fb entry lah. It's embarrassing; using this post to gain traction on urs.$$Admin: you should name ur pg as TheStupidLocal. com That sound better.$$Does anyone have a link to the video!? How bad can the video be!? I'm curious!$$TheSmartLocal.com I'm pretty aghast to see the kinds of posts which you are responding to, and the posts which you are liking (it's terribly easy to observe this). It makes me harbour more than a little doubt about how sincere your apology is.$$Not sure why there is a need for TheSmartLocal.com to apologise. Also not sure why the people commenting here are perceiving this as a ""mistake"". The ""facts"" of this entire saga is based on the dubious hearsay of one news site and some stray Facebook comments, since literally no one's watched the video that was taken down. If anyone reading this is interested to see what I mean, read what I already wrote and tell me again that you disagree. https://www.facebook.com/donovan.choy/posts/10210855810741367?pnref=story

The earthquake that rocked the mountain on the 5th of June, 7:15am triggered landslides along with rocks and boulders that tumbled down, destroying trails and sadly, taking lives. Joseph was found beneath a boulder, in the heroic act of shielding two of his guests. Unfortunately, the three of them didn’t survive.

Joseph was last seen hugging two of his guests, in an attempt to protect them, using his body as a shield, an account related by his fellow mountain guide colleague, Sharulnizam Suhaji. Sharulnizam describes Joseph as an easy-going person with a good heart, soft-spoken and always kind. 

Joseph has been a member of our team for almost 2 months. He has brought nothing but good memories and experiences for our fellow climbers. A man of courage and uncompromising thoughtfulness. His good-will and high-spirits will forever be remembered by all the lives he has touched.

Joseph left behind a loving wife, a 4-year old son and a 2-year old daughter. He promised his wife that he will come back to celebrate their wedding anniversary on the 12th of June. Our heartfelt condolences goes out to his family and to those affected.

This relaxation escapade by Jojo Struys over a 2 day itinerary from 26 to 27 November 2016, certainly is a super relaxation staycation that I need to explore on the bustling central that I cannot imagine the hidden gem that allows me to be totally carefree. 
Having high rise buildings around had not deterred what I hope to get from the stay in The Westin. 
Having to face the lovely scene of Marina Bays while engaging in a yoga session at infinity pool simply is a real luxury that takes my breath away. 
Indulgence of the SuperFoodsRx is something that I hope to be able to eat healthily and heartier for my tummy. 
Enjoying the jacuzzi and steambath certainly leads me to an enchanted space out that I hope to enjoy. 
What's the best part a cozy snuggle on the 10 layers of comfortable SIMMONS bed is what I call maximum pampered. 
Breakfast at seasonal tastes is making me missing the comfort to patronise again for my next escapade.

Would love to spend time with my newly engaged fiancé Sherilyn Esther Tan in this awesome staycation. Haven't really had time to plan for the wedding since we got engaged a couple weeks back.

There are some people who couldn’t understand why others spend on local hotel stays instead of getting out of Singapore for a holiday and enjoy the fresher air somewhere else. For me, a Singapore staycation is a good recharge when I couldn’t afford to take leave to travel/didn’t feel up to it. Being in Singapore elsewhere other at home can sometimes be quite a therapy! I can be momentarily be relieved from all stress, work and at the same time “fantasize” about having my own house. After so many staycations, I believe that I can do a not-too-bad job of interior design for my own house in future! Thanks! 😄$$Liked & shared!
The Westin is the BEST place for a getaway! Bcos it is conveniently located in the heart of Singapore (you escape to where there is most blood supply yeah) and offers magnificent view! If you're in luck, u can even wave to the cruise ship (with a binoculars no less!)
This Relaxation Escape with Jojo Struys will be benefitting to us since our labour of love is hatched (not really in a shell but she did come out in her own water bag! En-caul birth! 1 in 80,000 births!)

A new bill protecting the rights of transgenders has passed in the upper house of Parliament and will be presented in the lower house this year. Last January, Madhu Bai Kinnar was elected mayor of Raigarh — the first transgender elected to run any Indian city.

Unlike in the United States, where L.G.B.T. rights are an issue too hot for many politicians to touch, in India homophobia is diffuse, and hardly features in our culture wars.

While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact:
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

Singlish version: Singlish best dun believe watch this video la.

SEE WHAT I MEAN!!

Also read: http://thesmartlocal.com/read/food-trends ","That chope move!! #winliaolor XDD$$This is a long post but just wanted to let some of my fellow Singlishers know. (This was in response to someone's comment about Singlish being inferior to English).

Singlish is a totally separate language system from English. It is neither an ""accented"" English, ""lazy/broken"" English, nor a ""dialect"".

A language system is not only defined by its vocabulary but also its pragmatics and universal grammaticular and audinal rules, which Singlish satisfies.

If you don't believe what I'm saying, I recommend you to read up some thesis publications especially in ""Language and Development"" regarding the establishment of Singlish as an entire new language system, which has since gained steam post 2008s as the progress and knowledge of human language development blossomed. Some of these were written and taught by multiple professors when I was in NUS, and they (foreign lecturers) were behind the stand that Singlish was innately a language, not a dialect.

Having established this, it is only natural if a foreigner is unable to understand us whilst in Singapore, the same way I wouldn't understand Tagalog if I were in Philippines or any other country, simply because it is another LANGUAGE, not a corruption of English.

I truly feel that Singaporeans need to take ownership of our beloved native language and enjoy its usage to the maximum. Do not be ashamed of it and do not let anyone make you feel that Singlish is inferior to English because it is not.

Cheers to all the Singlish speakers out there.$$Not bad but not a very accurate representation.

It features a variety of traditional arts and crafts such as urushi lacquer, Nishijin woven silks, bamboo woodwork, and so on.

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one 😂😂 damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london 😍😍 my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it 😂$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin – Singapore’s 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu.

A big thank you to everyone who participated, and to GEOX for sponsoring this giveaway. Head down to the nearest outlet for their ongoing sales this weekend!$$Liked, Shared and love to win $100 GEOX voucher! I had a first pair of GEOX years ago, it was so comfy, and i would love to win a new pair cos the old one was worn to bits :p I could see that a new pair of GEOX boots will keep me warm when i travel to cool climates!!! :)$$Subscribed, liked & shared! I always have trouble on what shoes shall I pack when I travel. Thanks to this post, I am sure going to get a Geox product regardless if I win the voucher or not. But with the voucher, it certainly allows the let me have more pairs!$$When creating a pair of shoes, it is often a struggle between form and function. Not many can strike that fine balance between form and function -- GEOX shoes stand out not only because they have mastered this balance, but they have upped the ante by adding comfort to its highest possible level. 

I have never owned a pair of GEOX before but I truly believe that GEOX lives up to its name as I have seen a pair of GEOX that has been with my friend for almost 10 years. I want to win this GEOX voucher so that I can have a chance to experience this kind of relationship with a shoe! And then influence another person to get GEOX! Thanks in advance for this opportunity!$$Subscribed, liked & shared. Nope, I'm not winning this for myself. I'd like to win this for my mother. She would be traveling to Japan next month and the climate there is said to be really cold. She has never seen snow in her 62 years of living and she intends to wear her track shoes there as she's a thrifty woman. Therefore I sincerely hope to win this voucher so that I can buy her a pair of winter boots to keep her feet warm when she travels to Japan next month. That's the least I could do as a daughter I suppose and not let her wear track shoes while walking in the snow (: happy 2016 to you guys anyway! Cheers*!$$I should win this because Chiang Mai is a lovely place and I'm singing its praises because I have been to this city, had memorable memories and would love to return again. With its breezy mountain weather, cheap food and many cultural places of interest. It's amazing and way better than Bangkok if you are more into the Arts and Cultural sort of person. I did participate in the festivals like Loi Krathong (floating the boat on water) and Lanna (floating lanterns), it's awe- inspiring. And I wish to return to experience the wonder sight of the Sakura blooming and check off my bucket list too!$$I would like to win this for a very special someone Samantha Lee. She is my fiancee. She likes to travel around the world with me. She can definitely have this pair of boots to walk the world with me. Really hope to win this for her.$$I have been travelling a lot and realised that having a good trusty pair of shoes for travel is very important. Many times I have to pack like a pair of sneakers, pumps, slippers etc into my luggage which takes up a lot of space and weight, not forgetting those bulky thick winter coats when travelling to cold countries. Geox is a trustable brand for its comfyness which is stylish, at the same time, to match with all types of outfits! With this pair of boots, I don't have to worry about packing so many shoes into my luggage anymore! Hope I can win this and own my first pair of Geox! 😊🙆$$I should win because I only wear GEOX's shoes after I have foot problems.  It's the only shoes that helps me walk like a normal person again!

I should win as I am a big fan of GEOX especially because of its  technological innovation and Italian style. Geox's footwear exemplifies this style and innovation, thanks to original designs and exceptional breathability. In Geox shoes and boots, a patented system consisting of a microporous membrane placed on top of a perforated rubber sole allows heat and humidity to escape from my feet, and keeps the shoes fresh and comfortable all day. :D Despite this enhanced breathability, many Geox shoes and boots remain waterproof and that's crucial living in Singapore where it can rain anytime anywhere! :)$$Liked & Shared! I wish to win this because a pair of waterproof boots is important to me as I love to explore places with wet terrain and not to mention that my feet would be able to breathe in them too!$$like and shared. would like to win a pair of winter boots for upcoming trip in New Zealand! heard that GEOX boots are light and comfortable!",0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Here's something different for our readers. In Singapore, most of us go through our lives like drones, getting all our ""skills"" from textbooks. But we never pay attention to the skills that will truly help us in life. The ones that matter. Like making new friends, building relationships and pushing ourselves off that ledge of comfort that we desperately cling on to. We fear the unknown and unfamiliar.

So where do you start? That's why we decided to write this guide.

Go out there and start talking to people. Rake up some smiles, meet your new business partner, talk to that cute boy/girl in line, find out about a cool new bar and so much more. Remember the next time you hesitate about talking to someone interesting, you could be missing out on a whole lot of life.

KTX doesn't go all the way to Gyeongju; you will transfer to a different train for the last hour of the journey.

I really really like to win a Korea trip because I have never ever been there yet. And my sis kept going Korea several times for 4 yrs consecutively. She has been telling me so much great things Korea offer and the nice places she has been to were so lovely and pretty. That gave me lots of insights and more urges to visit Korea so badly!!!! If I really win, I will first indulge in their Korea food because I want to taste how authentic their food is and will take lots of food pics as my spouse & I are food lovers!!! My desired #shopping item will be their food that we can't never get in Singapore and I probably will spend about S$200 on #souvenirs as I heard Korea has many handcrafted goodies. My spouse & i will be deeply grateful if I win this fantastic holiday and I intend to go during this coming December for a super white, cold Xmas to spend a lovely and memorable Korea trip for the 1st time in my life!!!

Studied so much about this country..Much history those Pinoy/Americans know very little about their home country & the past that Pilipinos went through with Spain & the US, yet coming out of that dark era they became such humble caring lovely people, as they always were trading peacefully & tribal for thousands of years, with ancient writings and connections as far as Morroco & India who settled in this country long before the Spanish. It is an endless wonder & mystical.. The OFWs here in Australia are not like the Pilipino people you meet in the Provence.. As a Kiwi/ New Zealander/Aotearoa I can relate to many things in Philippines. The Seafood & fresh organic produce and happy people...The singing, the diversity of culture! Can't wait to leave Australia one day for the Philippines!$$Truly amazing!! We took our first family trip there this past summer and stayed in Palawan.

Madurai became famous during the Sangam period through the third and last conglomeration of Tamil scholars, which existed for more than 100 years.

https://www.tourismphilippines.com.au/blog/2015/12/15/aussie-whos-been-to-37-countries-calls-the-philippines-the-most-beautiful/We love hearing stories from Australian travellers who have fallen in love with our country. Alex who blogs about his travels on SherackCity was interviewed recently by Choose Philippines. Check out what Alex had to say about his adventures across the islands of the Philippines. Meet Alexander Shera…","Alex knows his stuff. I agree and I've been to over 30 countries too.$$Thanks for sharing our article about Alex of SherackCity! #ChoosePhilippines$$the good guy knows...and 37 is large enough....
im a mariner,i stopped counting at 98 countries...
MY DECLARATION IS THE SAME!!!
ITS THE ""PHILIPPINES"" !!!!☺$$As a Canadian whose been to 40+ countries and the Philippines in 5x in 5 years, I have to agree. what makes Philippines amazing is its people; but Philippines natural wonders are breathtaking as well :)$$Oh and I hope to move there from England soon. Any Filipino ladies want to marry me so I can buy some land or a resort? Ha ha.$$I didn't have to travel to 30+ countries to figure out that the Philippines is the best😉$$He mean that Phillippines  is the most beautiful over 30 countries he visited is becuz of the culture and the hospitality of co filipino's, most of all the mother nature$$It was written once the country is liked by GOD he will let whole world know about it, many more like him will mention so much adoration about Philippines until all will agree this country is heaven on earth. Not just our economy (property) cinderalla story, or our military advancement , or our people excellent work (BPO/medical care nurses most liked service, Engineers, Professional and many more) and our unparalleled warm attitude towards foreigeners. Even in competition GOD already shown many times in different categories oN how He favored us to win the 3 top post. Another story Arab country from Dubai company Kampac Oil Group believe its worth it to fund $15 billion worth for railway system Manila to Pangasinan as they knew our economy will grow 3 times more which will make us the leader in Asia that is excluding using our natural resources such natural gas worth $26.3 trillion in West Philippine Sea our rock formation China forcibly reclaimed now a man made island, our rich deposits like palladium the south if not same amount as Russia next to them. How about our unlimited hydrogen fuel in short what ever the world need we have it. Imagine if Philippines will have the access back to thousand tons of gold bars then the country will become superior. These are just small part of signs and wonders one by one taking shape revealing. The more we love GOD the more blessing will come to our shore. Only those who chooses to be blind will not see all this thing from happening simultaneously. GOD wants to show to the world Philippines will be the center of Faith, easy sample is the concerts audience is all facing center stage see our geographic location. If anyone still think NOT true be our guest as Philippines will start showcasing to the world.$$Thanks Alex Sherack for openly sharing your thoughts on how ""BEAUTIFUL"" our beloved Philippines is! You're absolutely right... Our country is the ""MOST BEAUTIFUL""... Walang katulad, walang kawangis!! God bless the Philippines.$$Indeed our country, the Philippines is beautiful! It's just sad to think that our government is making it less appealing to the world.$$Having travelled to most of the world, I only recently holidayed in the Philippines. I never felt more accepted and treated so well as I have in the Philippines. I have since recommended the Philippines to all my friends and I will be returning again this year.$$#ALBAY , indEed the tourism meccA of the #BICOL region...

Discover world's mOst perfect coNe volcAnO and be amaze... visit nOw... hahaha$$Yes our country the Philippines is one of best in the world and the DOT has done its part in promoting it plus the airline companies making it affordable for people especially the locals to see theses destinations. So let us all try our best to let the tourists feel our hospitality- Filipino style and let them all feel the goodness of Filipinos. There are still other destinations that need government support in development.$$I'm an Aussie happily married to a beautiful Filipina been many times and wanted to retire there but sadly what hurts the Philippines and turned me off was the total corruption of small time government officials who wanted their fees under the table before I could get me permanent citizenship including one of my wife's distant relative but the people "" The normal citizens "" of the Philippines are the magnets to go back I don't go to the tourist spots I love living the life of the locals in Ilagan Isabella also the pollution is a big turn off but slightly acceptable$$It's a good place to visit. Especially the islands outside Luzon. 

But if you wish to move here, live in the provinces. Metro Manila is sooo bad ... maybe except Makati or Bonifacio Global city.$$Really true because another German  which stay in our neighbour house is hook up to Philippines  until now. He love Philippines he say other countries are beautifull but Philippines is the best and I love chatting with him. I said to him we Filipinos do our best to satisfy our visitors in what ever that we can. So to all foreign people visit Philippines so you can experience our culture and we well show you our best.$$Agree. From Australia 👍🏻 beautiful people. Down to earth and back to basics.

I love the Korea furniture museum  

Since years now i really like and i love deeply  to visit museums when travelling to new places. I think this is because museums tell me a lot about the culture of those places.
Museums are also fun. It’s almost impossible to get bored in a museum. Every museum will have at least one thing of interest to somebody.When visiting someplace new, you can find out about the culture of that place in many ways. You can go to a movie or a place of worship or a nightclub. Another option is to sit in the park and listen to the people around you. The easiest way to learn about a place’s culture, though, is by visiting its museums. Museums will show you the history of the place you’re visiting. They’ll show you what art the locals think is important.
Museums are also fun. Even if you’re not interested in art or history, there is always something to get your attention. Many museums now have what they call “hands-on” exhibits. These were originally designed to keep children occupied while their parents were looking at exhibits. However, museums have found that adults enjoy hands-on opportunities just as much as children. These exhibits have activities like pushing a button to hear more about what you’re looking at, creating your own work of art, or trying on clothes like those on the models in the museum.
People also enjoy visiting museums about unusual subjects. For instance, in my hometown there’s a museum devoted to the potato. This museum has art made out of potatoes. It also tells all about the history of the potato, and sells potato mementos like key chains and potato dolls.
People enjoy visiting this museum because it’s different. It’s not something they’d find in their hometown and the museum’s curator enjoys talking about the Great Potato. Museums are popular because they are about us. They reflect our creations, our values, and our dreams. No matter who you are or what you like, somewhere there is a museum that will amaze and interest you.

For me, keeping themselves like that makes them more vulnerable to deceit and maltreatment, which is then consequently detrimental over the areas (natural resources, ancestral land, culture) within their right and responsibility. Making themselves distant over the idea of progress and us encouraging them to keep it that way is a contributing factor over many issues concerning discrimination, land grabbing, over-industrialization, and even environmental harms. My proposal is to instead of encouraging them to keep a tribal nature, let's (the government and the people) make way for them to be part of an educated progress and development so that corporate greed would not swallow them whole. Think about it. I mean, sure, it all sounds well and good but ... what is the significance of ethnic tribes in our modern society? They're not animals, people. They're human beings. We shouldn't encourage them to keep it that way just because they ""look nice"". It's like keeping them in a psychological zoo by telling them it's okay to keep tribal traditions above modern beneficial progress. My point is that we should aim to educate them so that they would be more well-equipped to protect their culture and environment.$$The tribe collect sea cucumbers (pictured) and dry them to be sold on the foreign market, which Maentz found would sell for the equivalent of $83 a kilo.

What is it? 
Since 1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. The most recent large eruption was on this day back in 1965. Although considered active, this small volcano has been quiet over the last few decades. There are even hiking tours and overnight camping packages on offer now.

How to get there: 
Take a bus to Batangas from Cubao or Pasay.

Fun Fact: 
Want to know what it's like to swim inside a volcano? You can in Crater Lake. It's said that the high sulfuric content has medicinal properties. Some people have even scuba dived here. But don't stay too long. The lake water also has high concentrations of boron, magnesium, aluminum and sodium in salt form.

Cebu ranks 5th, Palawan 2nd, and Boracay has been announced the ""Best Island in the World!""More than 300,000 of our readers rated their favorite islands in the world (outside the U.S.) in this year's Readers' Choice Awards. Is your favorite on the list?","My favourite 2 Islands are 1) Barbados, I have owned a condo there since 1980 and visited my place 27 out of 33 years I have owned it. 2) Philippines, are my next favourite because it's beautiful and I married a Philippino Lady 10 years ago. We've been back 4 times, the Weather, People, Food great.
Our next trip there is in March and will stay for several months to visit my wife's family etc. This time we are going to spend a week in Boracay ( beautiful place). The only problem I have with the Philippines is the flight time (23 hours )' Barbados ( 4 and a half ). The weather is nearly the same with Barbados Hotter( close to equator) Philippines perfect weather. I love that place.
It's a fairly inexpensive island to visit/or live there, the Food Great, Beaches Beautiful.
It's a place to place on your Bucket List. Of course Barbados is a Must!! Take it from me I KNOW BARBADOS.$$It's great that your country is acknowledged for its beautiful islands. However, becoming too commercialized will only cause island erosion, water pollution, & decline in coral cover to name a few. There is a much needed balance between economic development and environmental protection. It's very crucial that the sustainability of these environments will not be exchanged for short-term economic gains.
If we become irresponsible, then say goodbye to Boracay's 4-kilometer beach of flour-fine sand. Say goodbye to experiencing Canyoneering, waterfall jumps and swimming with whale sharks in Cebu. Say goodbye to the paradise that is Palawan.$$I wasn't able to make it with my fiancé when I was there last. But I'm going to make it one of the stops with her shortly. I love this country it's so very, very beautiful. And the people are just as beautiful.

What is it like? 
Tubbataha Reef is a natural marine park that's considered as the global center of marine biodiversity. UNESCO has declared it a World Heritage Site, and in 1999 the Ramsar Convention in Iran listed it as one of the ""wetlands of international importance."" Explorations in the area have revealed that the park has no less than 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 11 species of shark, 13 species of whale and dolphin and even 100 species of bird. It is also the nesting grounds of green sea turtles and critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles. CNN Travel named it as one of the best dive sites in the world.

Fun Fact: 
Tubbataha is isolated, and can only be visited on a liveboard boat. There are no settlements on the islets in the area. Divers who want to visit and have an unforgettable experience must book in advance.

Proud Waraynon!$$So far, my favorite island in the Philippines!  It's really incredible!$$Been there! Nice place! More fun in the Philippines!$$Been there! Beautiful kalanggaman island$$I propose to the first stage of the restoration of the rivers of the Republic of the Philippines. Take the work of any mountain of 300 meters and above.
Towards the large flows of water from the mountain, at an altitude of, say, 1,000 meters, set concrete or plastic tubs, for example, 10 pieces of 10 meters in height. We got an inclined ladder. Accumulate in the tenth of a bath, the water is poured into the ninth, and so on, until the first bath.
From the first bath tubes protrude, and the water falls directly to the foot of the mountain where dug pond storage of chilled water.
So, what happened:
Crystal clear, enriched with all kinds of trace elements, accumulated in the bath at a height of 1000 meters. Her temperature is 6.7 degrees lower than at the foot of a law lowering the temperature due to the increase in height. The same temperature and ponds.
Hence, when applying several staircase, cool water of the river, roughly: the river basin area is multiplied by 6.7, divide by 100 and get no volatility, that is, the moisture remaining in the river
The results:
First. The lake is an accumulation of clear water, where you can drink for children and pregnant women, and surplus to sell and earn income.
Second. Chilled water from the lake gradually cools the water in the river, percolates down and cools the water in the surface and underground waters. Cooling reduces the volatility of all types of water resources, the accumulation of water and improve its quality due to dilution.
The third. Accumulation of water in rivers, reservoirs above and below ground, the increase of productive land, pastures and forests. And the creation of new jobs.
And a fourth. Received a standing simple actions and penny cost technology that will work without consuming any energy resources to 1,000 years - the life of concrete or plastic in an inactive environment.
Other parameters:
The falling water to turn the turbines can, and to provide electricity to farmers.
My technique, unlike the desalination and purification, which consume electricity like a monster, 365 days a year, of energy resources not consume.
Desalination and purification of the same 365 days a year emit hot air, that the warming will not be tolerated at all. My technology is no air emissions do not produce.
Permanent staff do not require.
Cheaper any human to 3-5.
Not so, but such technologies are available dozens of cubic kilometers of water, and to capitalize on this in the Amazon and the rivers of Africa to 0.3 trillion on.

If you have friends who will travel to Hong Kong Island with a tight budget, please ask them to avoid dorms (9/8/7/6/4/3 bunk bed) that spread on a few floors in an apartment mansion (next to locals, they need to go to work in the morning). You might pay lots of money just to sleep on mattress on the floor (far over-priced and incredibly cramped). Hot water may run out 5 minutes after shower (small electric heater). You also need to pay for towels and flip-flops. The sum you pay may be more than an economy hotel. Besides, there’s no time saving as you need to wait for the washrooms with some travelers (e.g. 30 mins). You can see some good comments but it’s a ""trap"". If you see there're many beds available and choose to stay, you will be regretted. As I said before, it's a ""trap"". Beware. Search different website, compare and choose carefully.

The Jeju Cherry Blossom Festival is April 6-8, more info here: http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_2_1.jsp?cid=700677$$That's great!!!

One of the best spots in Jeju for cherry blossoms is in Seogwipo around the Jeju Sports Complex.$$Thank you! Seogwipo is to far since I'm living in Jeju-si, would it be too crowded to shoot on Friday, April 6 up in the city during Cherry Blossom festival? Should I do it a couple of days earlier?$$Dear Thai-An Pham, according to the forecast above, the cherry blossoms are expected to start blooming on March 24 and peak around March 31st at Seogwipo, so you could definitely do it a few days before April 6 and be able to get good pictures of the blossoms without the crowds. The festivals tend to be more crowded on the weekends than weekdays, so Friday might be okay as well.$$That's great, thanks!

2097,340785907491_10152510021917492,What do you think of Korea's new logo and slogan?Korea has unveiled a new tourism slogan that highlights the nation as a trendy and cutting-edge travel destination. The Korea Tourism Organization announced on Tuesday the new tagline “Imagine your Korea” to replace the short-lived slogans “Dynamic Korea” and “Sparkling Korea.” While the former slog…,"I think you should use Facebook more to trial something new and to gauge opinion, rather than ask afterwards. This looks like it has been created on Microsoft word.... Also, 'imagine' isn't best word that could have been chosen. I agree with the above...'discover' is much better.$$Not sure.. it implies every person can imagine or have an ideal Korea the way they'd wanted it to be which may differ from reality.. I rather the word DISCOVER which invites to see and experience Korea through someone's own eyes.$$too simple. if i were a designer, i
prefer to make logo with brush (붓) to show sort of lightness and freedom like wing,
cuz what the word 'imagine' profoundly means and makes reciever think of it ..
moreover about the text: don't let them just'imagine' but carve in their mind of certain image.
it'll be much more important to discuss of what Korea can appeal.$$I entered that contest too and I'm a bit dissapointed about the new logo, I think it looks too bold :( That was my Application:$$Lol! .....I imagine a Korea where people are not racist , where foreigners get equal rights and opportunities and where big conglomerates don't exploit  international students(that are recruited) by cutting on their pay check and benefits while making them work long hours at the office. That would make the slogan "" Imagine your Korea "" :P Korea Tourism Organizationimagine >> reality$$Honestly, it does nothing to get me excited about Korea. Also it seems like it's aimed more at the domestic Korean tourist market than foreigners. Korea has so much natural beauty, history, culture and food...........this is what people want to see and experience. KPOP and Korean drama's are good and all, but show what the real Korea is about.$$Its nice..but how can you promote that much..your consulate in the philippines is very oppressive...there are about 800 delegates from philippines for a convention in seoul this september..but most of filipino delegates were denied of visa...most of the delegates had been to europe and australia but denied in korea. There are also delegates from US and from europe..what can also the organizer think? that convention is a tourism privilege for korea.$$This logo don't show us culture and traditions$$Neither  the logo and nor the slogan are eye catching or memorable.$$Let a great graphic artist have her free reign in creating a beautiful and effective design.  This is terrible.$$Sounds a bit strange... because nobody would say a sentence like ""imagine your..."". Not impacting enough... sounds like a typical korean slogan; which usually is put together using random english words :) i still love korea though!$$""Imagine your Korea?"" What is that supposed to mean..?$$You have good tourism fair..but in other hand ita unfair$$Not good. ""Imagine"" not match for tourism sector :) *just2cent*$$Hem.. I Love the new slogan but not the logo.. Sorry but it looks rigid...$$I want to go to Corea. It's my dream$$I see it as an invitation$$On IBuzz Korea they asked about the opinion, about that slogan, a few months ago. If I remember right.. I also think ""Imagine"" isn't really well chosen. One can also imagine bad things or things which are not true.$$Still not great. A lot of Westerners still don't really know enough about Korea before visiting here to ""imagine their own"" version of it.

Better to go with something more along the lines of ""discovery"" - like my Master's degree student project: Discover Korea - Tourism Branding: https://gumroad.com/l/discoverKorea$$I like the color it is reflection from hanbook right?!

Taiwan had been a second home and I have been back yearly since the first visit 5 years back. Have not done any of the wonderful activities listed and would LOVE to do everything, especially paragliding! 

One of the sketches I have done in Hua Lien, all the beauty of Taiwan kept in my little sketchbook. So please let me be there to fill up the rest of my sketchbook with the wonderful experiences only KKday and TheSmartLocal.com can bring! <3$$Having been to Taiwan every year for the past few years, I hope to experience a different and more authentic Taiwan experience brought by KKDay by drifting along the valley of hualien mountains with Yao Zong~ 😊😊$$Taiwan is like our second home! Even spending a good 5 months living there, we hadn't seen enough of it yet and have always been wanting to return to Taiwan to create new memories and relive old memories with Wong Chui Yuen. Many thanks to @KKday and @TheSmartLocal.com for this amazing post and opportunity to travel bacm to Taiwan! Hadnt had the opportunity to experience all these new activities, so really hope we can be picked and be ready for Taiwan!! :D$$liked and shared!! Went to Taiwan 4 times!! Taiwan has been the best nature scenery and great hotsprings! Great food is everywhere! I hope to visit more of Taiwan places with Leow Anthony hubby which we have not visited yet!$$I've never been to Taiwan and would love to visit it for the street food, the sightseeing and especially to indulge in the local culture (and maybe get to brush up on my Hokkien hahaha!) All the pictures and videos being shared online on Taiwan have got me dreaming of it constantly..... Hopefully I'll be able to visit it soon! ☺️$$I've never been to Taiwan before but always wanted to. I would love to try paragliding and diving in Taiwan! And all my friends who have been there always tell me that the foods are super!! So, foods, here we come!$$Taiwan is my annual to-go country! But year in year out, it's time to experience Taiwan like I've never before! Didn't even know that one could do paragliding in Taiwan prior to this post!$$I am looking forward to catch the magnificient sunrise view from Hehuanshan mountain! I have heard that Taiwan has many nice hiking places with beautiful natural views which I hope to experience there also! What's more, its always a regret for me not going to wulai for the hotspring when I been there few years back.

Hope to win a trip for two to Taiwan with my BFF Mei Hong as it has been my checklist for years!

Liked & Shared! 😊$$Liked and shared! It's been more than 6 years since I last visited Taiwan and I really miss the hospitality from everybody! I want to stay in a guesthouse and fully immerse myself in the local culture, as well as visit all my Taiwanese friends! Really looking forward to visiting Taiwan again :)$$There's always something worth exploring in Taiwan. Would love to paraglide over the mountains and catch a panoramic view of Taiwan tgt with my buddy Fiona Lam$$I am looking forward to visiting Alishan at Taiwan as it is one of the mountain in Taiwan whereby I could experience the nice scenery especially the sunrise moment, believe it would definitely be an eye opening with such great view!  I hope to be given a chance to fly there so that I could take valuable photos and share my experience with my love one and friends too!

Liked and shared!!! :)$$Haven't been to Taiwan before, but I have some Taiwanese friends that I have made during my internship in poly that I would like to visit after hearing how great Taiwan is from them! Moreover, there is the upcoming Sundown Marathon that is going to be held in Taiwan for the first time, and I would like to bring someone over with me who is also keen on doing the marathon there!

In addition, instead of just travelling to mainstream places where everybody frequents, I like to venture off to the unbeaten track and explore new things, just like the experiences mentioned in this guide!

Lastly, I hope to win this trip for 2 to Taiwan!$$Went to Taiwan for a few times but never have a chance to explore the counties & city outside Taipei city. For my next trip to Taiwan, I am looking forward to explore Taiwan's local culture from town to town by taking the Taiwan slow train.  This is one of the best way to understand the history & culture of each town as well as enjoying he beautiful scenery along the way! Best of all, I can have a chance to try out many delicacies & street food in different towns, as well as the must try platform bento from vendors at the train station!
Liked And Shared Awesome Giveaway! 
Hope to win this to visit Taiwan again with my husband!$$I just got back from Taiwan last month and didn't manage to tick any activities off this list!! I would love to go for the rafting and night shrimping session if I had the chance to!!$$My BFF and I have never been to any overseas trips together and we really hope that the organiser would grant us this opportunity to explore the charm of Taiwan. The major attractions of Taiwan to both us are their well-reserved natural tourist spots and the Taiwanese's people friendliness that can be seen in TV. We really really hope to feel Taiwan and best of luck to both of us so that this small little wish would be granted!! 2016 is the 'Time for Taiwan!!!! Florence Chong Huey Lin .😘$$I've never been to Taiwan before cos I don't trust my own standard of Chinese to survive there on my own... so winning the ticket means I can bring someone along (more proficient in Chinese) with me to survive the trip. And I wanna try paragliding! I've not had a chance to try it but it's something I'd wanted to try, cos it looks like something doable for a chicken-hearted me. 😁$$I've only been to Taipei once briefly and fell in love with the warmth and hospitality of the people there. However, I would really love to bring Victor Neo to Taiwan for his grad trip as he has never been, and it would be super duper awesome to discover the cool local stuff we can do in Taiwan with TSL and KKday's great recommendations. What I would really look forward to doing are the adventure sports such as rafting down Hualien mountain and also paragliding across the sky! *v*$$Hoping to win this trip as a gift to my significant other's parents! They loved everything about Taiwan on their last trip here 2 years ago. Every time Taiwan is mentioned, they can't stop reminiscing about how good the night market food is in Taiwan.

Thus, the activity I'm looking forward to the most for them is definitely exploring the numerous night markets across Taiwan! Having all the best eats in one place & perhaps even a guide to explain the best eats like what KKday offers would definitely make any trip to Taiwan even more memorable :)$$Liked and shared! I will love to try the paragliding in taiwan! Always know taiwan as a foodie heaven, didn't know that there's so much things to do over there. ❤️❤️❤️✈️✈️✈️🙆🙆🙆😍😍😍$$I've been to taiwan but never had i know that taiwan had such amazing activities. If i could, i would definitely want to try all the listed activities, if not , the top 3 would be the Paragliding, Hualian and Sunrise tour! However, if i'm only given a choice, I would definitely go for the sunrise tour! I have always wanted to try trekking but never have the chance to. Really hope to witness this magnificent view of taiwan. I believe both Alvin Tan and I would be wow-ed by it! :)$$I would love to go whale and dolphin watching in Taiwan! I have a huge love for the people of Taiwan, their hospitality and culture, and most of all...... Their food! Whale and dolphin watching added to all that would make it the perfect trip and I really hope to be given the chance to revisit Taiwan :) thanks for this giveaway!$$I just came back from a solo trip to Taiwan recently and I left my heart there, craving to continue my exploration of this friendly country! There's simply too much to do, especially looking forward to the paragliding if I get the chance (:$$Been to Taiwan many times and only explored Taipei the bustling city always! Only gone there for eating and shopping, never been there to try out activities like a local!! Hope to try the diving and paragliding 😍😍😍 And this could be the best present for 18th birthday this year! 😊$$I have never been to Taiwan but I have experienced Taiwan vicariously through stories on how beautiful it is, how unique the people are, and how delicious its food is.

http://japan-magazine.jnto.go.jp/en/special_koji-honpo.html ","thanks for Love        LOVE    JAPAN$$Dear Sirs,                             
For 5 years I am an active user of SONY VAIO LAPTOP and SONY PLAYSTATION and very satisfied with the SONY products. For 6 years I use mobile phones from Apple and that what I have to complain about, that happened to me in these 6 years with any of my Apple products.
Through the media, my attention was drawn slowly but surely on the SONY deals on smart phones and was on November 22, 2014, I became a member of the Sony family, because I bought the Sony Xperia Z3 COMPACT (IMEI 355179065283809). First of all I was annoyed that I had not sooner worried me the phone because I loved the design, battery life and until I broke the glass of the back in my pocket by the software about two weeks ago and I injured my finger , Although I have understanding that it may be different in reality than promised in the ads, but that the back so fragmented, although it has come to a pointed object, surprised me very much.
I brought the phone to the competent charging and not surprised that I did not meet the warranty conditions and had to pay 90 TL for changing the glass back. Finally I sat down on it. It has lasted two weeks until I got the phone.
I realized immediately that the Proxmity sensor was not working and was told by the service that the Geraet was incorrectly installed and repaired it. After all the trouble I used the mobile phone full of joy and bought an expensive protective cover to protect it from further unexpected accidents.
But the blow came faster than expected and has brought the camel's back. Last night as I wanted to put me into the car, the phone fell out of my pocket on the ground, there was a height of 30 cm. The glass of the front and the back broke, even though it was in the case is a thousand pieces. I can not afford absolutely no understanding that the phone after a fall of 30 cm can come into this state. None of my friends can not believe it that the phone came with a simple fall into this state.
I'm really disappointed in Sony because they have such bad use or sensitive material, without considering that there is some device (finally a '' MOBILE '') which should withstand some shock or mishaps. For me it's just firmly around held between two panes of glass with fine black-cheap plastic thing that simply join in anything. Frankly, I'm disappointed in myself that I have the Sony familiar advertising and have too little research on the user comments had experienced in the hundreds same.
I can not understand that Sony has chosen as a marketing strategy that finally we have no complaints million per country, only a few hundred. I also do not see that it enters the warranty conditions, although the choice of the material just heard of being attributed to producers and for which the user is not enough information has been advised of the sensibility of the glass.
I should point out that I will do everything possible to make my consumer protection claims and as long as this publicly manifest until I get my right because SONY  Turkey does not take any action and they do not give my money back or change my phone!!! Please help me about this problem as you do to your customers in the United States Of America and United Kingdom and Japan.
With best regards

Mount Abu is situated at the southern tip of the Aravali range, the hill retreat owes its cool climate to its rich flora covering the entire hillside that includes coniferous trees and flowering shrubs. During the period of the Maharajas, it was used as a place of leisure by the royalties. The place presents an interesting contrast of British style bungalows and holiday lodges with various tribal communities residing amidst the thick lush forest on the hills surrounding the region.

I am sure she will appreciate the tranquillity of the Pan Pacific serviced suite and be able rest till her heart's content before she pops on CNY. Joyce Liang$$Hello TheSmartLocal.com and pan pac, thanks for organising this staycation giveaway!
For me, I'd hope to win it for my dad and my mom. We generally don't travel much together and hence, don't stay in hotels also because my parents find it too expensive. I hope they get to experience the luxury and comfort that others enjoy too. There was once my dad mentioned that he wanted to bring us to a hotel buffet as a surprise weekend lunch. Hearing that made me realise how special a buffet, much less one held at a hotel was for him, even though we might consider it to be nothing much. Therefore if they get to stay there, I can imagine how it will come as a huge shock and surprise for the both of them.

Thank you so much!

Warren Soo$$As my partner and I are currently in a long distance relationship, time spent together in Singapore when I'm back in town are precious to us. Due to my partner's work commitment, we are not able to travel overseas for holidays. A staycation in Singapore would be perfect as it allows us to spend quality time together as a couple despite work constraints. Furthermore, this gives me the opportunity to become a tourist in my home country, appreciating Singapore's beauty after being away in a foreign country for so long.$$Liked and shared! Would like to win this staycation for my parents who didn't have a chance to go on a holiday for years. Their schedule are always tight down by work and even a short cruise or 3D2N trip are too demanding.

My partner and I have been struggling in a long distance relationship due to the 7hours time difference and work schedule, and paying for a house.

So are you ready?  You have 24 hours starting NOW!!! ","My favorite place in Korea has to be Seoul. The real story of Seoul is not hidden in the tall skyscrapers or the ancient temples that encircle the urban center, but in a few important landmarks that are both historically significant and symbolic at the same time. Take Jongno street for instance. Better known as the ""Bell Street,"" Jogno is famous for Bosingak, which is a marquee with a large bell. It is said the bell signals different times of a day and controls the four main gates to the city. The bell is usually rung thirty-three times at the midnight on New Year's Eve. However, when former president Kim Dae-jung took office in 1998, the bell was rung in the midst of an intense economic crisis that had hit the country. Every Korean worth his salt knows that Kim opened a new chapter of economic transparency and played an even greater role of steering the country on the world map by hosting international events such as the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The melancholic yet inspiring sound of the bell has definitely struck a chord with millions of locals and expats living in or across Seoul, just like me :)$$My favourite place is Incheon Airport.  It's a bitter-sweet feeling for me everytime I was there, the excitement when arriving and the sad feeling when departing...all beyond words.  The airport is always sparkling clean and alive, always welcoming to visitors and have good food and shopping to spend time before heading to the gate.  Best place to catch sun sets and to spot Rain. : )$$My favourite place in Korea is in Seoraksan National Park. At the peak of Daechongbong you can escape the hustle bustle of the city and get the ultimate view of the true beauty Korea has to offer. It’s a grueling climb to the top, but once there the scenery is breathtaking. You can see for miles on a clear day and bask in the peace at the top of the mountain. For me, Korea is largely about the mountains, and there is no better place to experience this.$$While we're on a food theme, it has to be Jeollado.  While I'd heard the food was going to be good (and it was), I'd also been led to expect the people to be a bit cold or tough.  Instead, I had some of my most memorable experiences on the road as people shared parts of their lives with me that I never expected.  In between that, I travelled deserted beaches on the south coast, walked through tea fields, dozed on a pagoda with a praying mantis in perhaps the prettiest temple I'd seen and cruised around glass-like seas.  And, of course, I ate.  A lot, well, and unusually, all prepared to an amazingly high standard (in a country that already had impressed me with the quality and care in its food).

Oh, and I highly recommend the goat.$$Call me a sentimental old fool, but it will have to be the old world charm of Andong for me. Even Queen Elizabeth II spent her birthday in Andong with a little celebration at the Soju Museum. Andong is the center of culture and folk traditions, noted for its serene beauty. I love history and Andong is steeped in it, right from the Three Kingdoms Period of Silla, Goguryeo and Baekje right up to the Joseon Dynasty. At the core of Andong’s long and illustrious past were numerous distinguished scholars, aristocrats and noblemen. It has the reputation of being the best preserved ancient metropolitan city. You can still find many of the homes of the noble class in Andong today. It used to be the centre for Confucianism at one point in Korean history. I may not be a follower of Confucianism but I respect some of their beliefs like justice and good manners are the key factors in life and I also admire their filial piety towards their elders.
Though the die-hard Confucians are not around anymore, Andong is one of the few places in the world where Confucian practices are still directly being passed down to its descendants to this day, as well as being a centre of education. Its current inhabitants are the direct descendants of those who actually occupied the houses in the Joseon Dynasty era. Because of its highly historical value, the village itself is often being referred to as a ‘roofless museum’.
I would like to go to Andong to enjoy a stay in the traditional hanok guest houses available throughout the area. The Hahoe Village, Jirye Art Village, Jeonju Ryussi-musiljongtaek (Ryu noble family’s estate), I understand, are great places to experience a unique lodging experience and to sample the true essence of Korea’s traditional lifestyles. I just love traditional old houses and seowons and Andong is a treasure trove filled with them. The Andong Hahoe Folk Village which was designated Important Folk Material #122 is now up for nomination to become a World Heritage Site in 2010. Hahoe is especially known for its mask dances. The Dosan Confucian Academy, the Byeongsan Seowon Academy, 
Jirye Art Village, Andong Folk Museum, Goseong Lee head family Estate, Imcheonggak Pavillion, Ocheon Relics Site(village), the Hahoe Mask Museum and a 600-year-old zelkova tree in the Samshin-dang area are what I want to see in Andong. 

Perhaps my exposure to Korean movies/dramas set in the Joseon era, like Untold Scandal, Daejanggeum, Hwang Jini, Damo and Painter of the Wind have  contributed to my obsession of Andong.

I must not forget to mention the authentic Andong food that I want to try like heotjesatbap (this dish originates from the custom of using vegetables, meat, and seafood dishes left from memorial services) that includes Andong-style bibimbap.
Andong specialty that is sometimes included in the heot jesa bap is gan godeung-eo, or super, super salty mackerel. Some other Andong dishes include Andong Jjimdak, Andong Sikhye and Geonjin Guksu.
$$I have 3 favorite places in Korea: the Gyeongbokgung Palace, including Changdeokgung Palace (Rear Garden included), Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksucgung Palace, and Joncgmyo Shrine. I'd like to stay at the ""Secret Garden"" that was intended for the King. I find peace and serenity while walking inside the palace grounds. The other place is the Korean Village. I want to live in the traditional 'Hanok"" house and experience korean living. Lastly, Myeongdong, particularly, the Myeongdong Cathedral (Catholic Church).  Solemnity and solace in this place, is a sanctuary for me.$$@George Romeiser Hogan: thank you for those beautiful words as you describe Korea in your heart. You are right in every detail.

For 5 years I am an active user of SONY VAIO LAPTOP and SONY PLAYSTATION and very satisfied with the SONY products. For 6 years I use mobile phones from Apple and that what I have to complain about, that happened to me in these 6 years with any of my Apple products.
Through the media, my attention was drawn slowly but surely on the SONY deals on smart phones and was on November 22, 2014, I became a member of the Sony family, because I bought the Sony Xperia Z3 COMPACT (IMEI 355179065283809). First of all I was annoyed that I had not sooner worried me the phone because I loved the design, battery life and until I broke the glass of the back in my pocket by the software about two weeks ago and I injured my finger , Although I have understanding that it may be different in reality than promised in the ads, but that the back so fragmented, although it has come to a pointed object, surprised me very much.
I brought the phone to the competent charging and not surprised that I did not meet the warranty conditions and had to pay 90 TL for changing the glass back. Finally I sat down on it. It has lasted two weeks until I got the phone.
I realized immediately that the Proxmity sensor was not working and was told by the service that the Geraet was incorrectly installed and repaired it. After all the trouble I used the mobile phone full of joy and bought an expensive protective cover to protect it from further unexpected accidents.
But the blow came faster than expected and has brought the camel's back. Last night as I wanted to put me into the car, the phone fell out of my pocket on the ground, there was a height of 30 cm. The glass of the front and the back broke, even though it was in the case is a thousand pieces. I can not afford absolutely no understanding that the phone after a fall of 30 cm can come into this state. None of my friends can not believe it that the phone came with a simple fall into this state.
I'm really disappointed in Sony because they have such bad use or sensitive material, without considering that there is some device (finally a '' MOBILE '') which should withstand some shock or mishaps. For me it's just firmly around held between two panes of glass with fine black-cheap plastic thing that simply join in anything. Frankly, I'm disappointed in myself that I have the Sony familiar advertising and have too little research on the user comments had experienced in the hundreds same.
I can not understand that Sony has chosen as a marketing strategy that finally we have no complaints million per country, only a few hundred. I also do not see that it enters the warranty conditions, although the choice of the material just heard of being attributed to producers and for which the user is not enough information has been advised of the sensibility of the glass.
I should point out that I will do everything possible to make my consumer protection claims and as long as this publicly manifest until I get my right because SONY  Turkey does not take any action and they do not give my money back or change my phone!!! Please help me about this problem as you do to your customers in the United States Of America and United Kingdom and Japan.

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what’s around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to develop in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into   
knowing existence.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

They are small, but does not mean they are ""easier"" to take care. 

If you do not intend to let your rabbit free roam or at least have a 3m by 3m playpen to house it, please do buy rabbits. They are indoor animals, not to be kept along the corridor to be exposed to rain and shine. 

They are domesticated. So do not bring them out like how you bring out dogs. They get stressed up very easily and may die from it. Once they stop eating or drinking for 24hours, they may die from gut stasis, which is VERY common for rabbits. 

Please, do not get any animals to teach yourself or your family member on being ""responsible"". No lives is too insignificant to be cherished for.$$While I can see that this is an advertorial post 'brought to you by Rabbit Headquarters', it seems like only one surface was scratched by this article. What it lacks to provide a wholesome view, is the position of animal welfare groups such as SPCA Singapore, House Rabbit Society Singapore (HRSS) and Bunny Wonderland that actually rescued rabbits that were bought by petshop patrons and then surrendered. Some of them were severely neglected because they were bought as toys and not as living things. These rescues nurse them back to health and help them to find a new home, without monetary gain. Hopefully Singapore readers will realize there is always 2 sides to a coin and make a more educational decision to do what is right. And until there is no rabbit to be adopted in these shelters, then I will feel it is right to buy a rabbit produced just for you by petshops.$$I think you need to publish about rabbit SHELTERS rather than a wannabe HQ that does not save abandoned rabbits. Money for you is one thing, doing the right thing is another.$$Please consider adopting a pet bunny from House Rabbit Society Singapore (HRSS) or Bunny Wonderland instead. When you adopt, you save TWO LIVES. 🐰🐰$$Dont just buy because its cute and abandon them when you are sick of it or when the rabbit is old.

My boyfriend is an avid flyer (SO avid that he can tell you the exact engine codes once he hears an airplane fly past. No kidding.), and his dream has always been to be a pilot himself. Though he hasn't been able to do so, he loves all things to do with planes and coming on this trip would give us the perfect opportunity to extend our stay and engage this pilot!

We have received multiple feedback that the queue has become INSANE. It's now a 2-3 hours long wait for a bowl of noddles and it is just not worth it. You're only going to end up disappointed and angry. The actual queue should be 10 minutes long, that's how long we waited originally.

They did NO PR and NO promotion. So they were completely unprepared to accommodate the sudden influx of visitors - they still only have ONE CHEF who does ALL THE COOKING.

Please wait at least one month for the hype to die down. Here's a picture of the queue that extended even outside the shop, taken by my friend alexischeong.com who went to check it out after we posted our blog. We honestly just wanted to share a good find and did not expect soooo many people to share our review.

So do visit this place, but only in a month's time or so otherwise you're going to end up disappointed. If it's a 10 minute wait, you will definitely love it as much as we did and that is how it should be experienced.

4) my wife phone
5) for any other device needed$$need that xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger!! 

adapters for different countries are such a pain to begin with, let alone needing to charge everything I need to charge via USB from iPhone to GoPro to Power Bank to Quodos Light. (wah, see, 4 items, just nice)

no more fighting for power with my Macbook, Camera Batteries, Flash Batteries, omg - everyone travelling with me will hate me less for hogging all the power but anyways!! 

then they should just get their own xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger + power bank too hahahaa.$$Would love to have xPower PB10Q Power Bank... Always wanting to travel and capture my favourite moments. But somehow my phone goes into Low battery and did not have the chance to take my special moment! Hope this will help enhance my gadget efficacies...esp when I'm a gadget amateur!! Hope to win this!!$$Liked and shared! I would like to win the xPower PB10Q Power Bank as a birthday gift for my boyfriend! I think these power banks are made for people like my boyfriend who on internet for 24 hours, playing games, researching, snapping pictures especially, navigating at the same time even when overseas. We love traveling and will travel at least once or twice a year therefore, we really like to own this powerful gadget! (:$$i would say that xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save me when i am travelling, i need to charge my portable wifiegg and phone so that i can last a day with wifi when i travel !$$The charger is a lifesaver especially when I depend on my iPhone to capture moments on top of communicating and navigating. I also like to share the moments I capture and also revisit them during my free time. This charger ensures that there will never be a moment I can't capture. The multi 5 USB ports just makes things even better! Now 4 other friends enjoy such certainty as well (:$$I need that xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger during travelling. There's limited power supplies in the hotel room. Sometimes, u will forget to bring power extension too.

It's always a pain to charge everything at night from phones to cameras, flash batteries to Power Bank. With this awesome xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger, there will be no more hogging to the power supplies! :)$$I would love to gift the xPower WC3QT travel charger to my boyfriend as he often charges his devices (laptop and especially phone as he always play game)! It's important that he gets all his devices charged up and be ready for both school and work, and also when we travel together at a later time of this year! Since he's such a forgetful person, this multi-functional charger would benefit him a lot!$$I m always lugging around 3 portable batteries as I need to charge my iPhone and iPad! Please rescue my shoulders as they are aching everyday from the load I carry. I need xPower DC5S Charger to charge my iPad, my phone and my portable fan to keep me from fainting in this heatwave.$$The xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save my life because my phone's battery life is quite short. It would definitely need a mid-day charge if im using it actively as my GPS$$I think the xPower PB10Q Power Bank would be very apt to save my life from a dead phone. It's less a question of need but one of want, as my current portable charger is good for one charge and is the size of a KitKat. So this is less of an entry into a lucky draw, but more of a plea for a better, longer, phone life. PLEEEEEEAAAASSSEEEE$$xPower DC5S Charger will save my life whenever I'm overseas cos the number of available sockets in hotel rooms are either too far apart till my items are everywhere or there are simply not enough sockets for me to charge my phone/dslr battery/portable charger. With this, at least I can consolidate all my tech devices together without having to worry about leaving one behind! :)$$Liked & shared. I hope I can win the xPower DC5S Charger as I'll be going overseas next month & my family of 4 will be squeezing in one hotel room! This means that we need to fight for the electrical sockets to charge our devices when we reached back in our hotel room. So it would be perfect to owe the xPower DC5S Charger to increase the efficiency by charging so many our devices at the same time! Furthermore, the added advantage of the xPower DC5S Charger is that it comes with a removable handphone stand so that our devices will not be wandering around and we can save the hassle of finding them! :-)$$Liked and shared!

I definitely need the xPower DC5S Power, though it's a close fight with   xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger.

Given that I usually travel with someone else, getting enough power points for our numerous gadgets is a massive headache.

Count this: Camera (ok, not fair to count it cos it doesn't use USB but it does take up one power point on its own), portable power bank, phone, tablet, smart watch, and iPod (yes, I'm old skool... Cos I don't wanna drain my phone's batt.) and then multiply by the number of travelers and you roughly get the idea of how many power points we will need if not for the multi-USB charger. I can bring my own travel adaptor for just one charger and that's it.

Wei Ling Bimira, you'll agree...$$xPower DC5S Charger will definitely be a life-saver, not only for myself, but for fellow travellers in my group, especially on long road trips with no power source in sight. =)$$Item: the xPower PB10Q Power Bank. I need it to charge my phone whenever it runs out of battery whilst im overseas. Caused me to not be able to take photos and even, record beautiful moments.$$xPower PB10Q Power Bank will be my life saver!
I'm a heavy phone user and can't last a few hours without my phone!

Calanggaman Island, Leyte

What is it? 
By those who know about it, this ten-hectare hidden gem is adored for its supremely fine white sands. But the real adventure begins below the surface —with up to 30-meter visibility and an expansive reef, this marine reserve also provides a mystifying dive experience.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Calbayog or Tacloban

Fun Fact: 
The island gets its name from the Cebuano word for bird, possibly owing to the two sandbars that stretch out like wings from its shores.
