Send it to us at manila@coconuts.co. No thanks to the expensive direct flights and mostly posh luxury resorts dotting its islands, Northern Palawan has remained inaccessible to most people. Which is sad, because there is more to Busuanga, Coron and El Nido than expensive island living. El‚Ä¶","Let me tell you one thing right away though this is a good article you can do it even cheaper than this. Return flights from Cebu or Manila to Puerto Princesa should cost no more than about php 4500. The van ride from Puerto to El Nido is NOT 850, it should cost about 500-600. I go to Palawan at least twice a year as my fianc√©e lives there...trust me the people here who have said you should stay away from exclusive and top resorts are right. Find the smaller out of the way places you'll pay much less. Even better get a local to book it..they get better rates always on everything and I mean EVERYTHING. For me I loved El Nido, but if you want boat trips, friendly locals, good food (but not essential electric) then go to Port Barton. I actually preferred Port Barton to El Nido because of its' laid back feel. El Nido can get very busy and full of tourists...it's nowhere near as bad as say Boracay but you don't really get the real feel of the Philippines there.$$i love the philippines not 4 the posh  resots but the true life with the poor & simple people$$Thank you

Cheap and they organize afforable activities with ya (we did a sneaky camp trip ;) ) - and you could do a couple of dives with Palawan Divers - El Nido.. Pretty good local eatery around the corner as well. 
Trattoria Altrove is a definite must if you have a little bit of extra cash to spare. Delicious food. 
And for a night out, Kape Pukka - El Nido is a local/backpack favorite. Listen to Mike (the surf instructor) for some wicked jams and chill the night away. Great fun, really wanna come back!

 10:00 AM-10:05 AM The PRS system is failed in all India. Still the tickets sold during that period.. this is illogical and bit to surprise.

10:05 AM-10:25 AM a common IRCTC user mainly face a problem related to the payment gateway. 

10:25 AM-12:00 PM Everything becomes normal, if u call the customer care executive.. they will ask for the problem screenshots. And that is resolved in 2 months

First of all, I would like to send my warm greetings to you and your team. I am a Vietnamese undergraduate student in Hallym University, South Korea, and my major is Advertising and Public Relations. I am taking the course ""Special topics in Public relations"" which requires self-studying and research in a topic of choice. My topic is ""The use of Social Media in Nation Branding"", and I was wondering if you could provide me some information regarding your activities. For example, how you find this page (or other SNS) effective in terms of promoting your country, what kind of information you post and the interactions with fans/users, the number of fans you have and how it increased in time. If you could provide me some statistics of the page, that would be really wonderful! I also wish to know that in your perspective, how different the social media and traditional media are, in terms of use and effectiveness for Nation Branding purpose. Any information that you give will be used for class assignment only. I highly appreciate your help and I am sorry if this bothers you. I also want to say that I think you and your team are doing a great job with the page. I really want to visit your country in the future.

Only to wake up the next day in a dark room, tied to a chair with the puppet from the Saw movies sitting across from them. They'd have 10 mins to lose as many kg as their maid did or game over.$$The question that begs to be asked here is, where is the philipines goverment, should they not step in and defend their own citizen and insist that fair justice is serve, such employers should be blacklisted and the courts should judge on a case to case basis.$$If the first maid was treated likewise why didn't the agent do anything to highlight such errant employers to MOM???$$This is so so so badly written. They don't even mention the couple claiming OCD on the wife's part. The source who wrote this sounds more like a pissed off blogger than anything else. Also everything mentioned here HAS been mentioned if you follow various news sources. 
That being said I definitely do not condone their behavior, in fact I hope Ms Thelma wins. This is one of those horrific pieces of news that makes you question, where is humanity. If the wife really has OCD (which can be very severe), the court should assess her and see if it's really true or just a convenient excuse. Anyone who treats a fellow equal this way deserves to be punished. There were SO many ways for the husband to help the domestic worker, he could even have sent Ms Thelma back and said my wife is unwell and as a result my helper is bearing the brunt of it.

Among the must-see natural beauty surrounding El Nido is Miniloc Island. We hopped on a boat for a day-long journey and upon arriving at this lagoon, everyone was eager to get in the water. Kayaking between the narrow, tower-leaning limestone cliffs with the greenest of vegetation was a breathtaking spectacle.

http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/financial-mistakesFrom your graduation to planning for your child's education, there are fi cial decisions to be made at every stage of your life. Are you guilty of #3?","Someone needs to teach the author of this article ""value investing"" instead of everything go for lower cost alternatives$$Disagree on the Class A vs B/C option.

In truth, there is still a shortage of hospital beds and may or may not be solved even after the announced hospitals are built (Sengkang General Hospital for example) because these are geared more towards a 6.9 million population planning!!!

So the right thing for ALL young people should be:

1) Getting a private shield plan that is fully payable by Medisave (Except riders, so some savings in cash is still needed)

2) Medisave will only capped at $49,800 in 2016 and increase it annually as needed. 

Excess will be parked at Special Account.

But given that an average uni grad starts to work at 25 at 2015, in 30 yrs time with an annual average inflation of 3%, the CPF Minimum Sum would be around $390,000 by the time reach 55.

BUT, your CPF LIFE payout is only $1,200 since currently the CPF LIFE payout has no provision for inflation adjusted payout.

In then's terms, it is about $495 in 2015 value.

So in short, there is no incentive to park the money in Medisave, and one gets better benefits in a Class A or even private Hospital, most importantly is about securing a hospital bed!!!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Fun Fact:
The fertile lands of Albay makes agriculture one of the province's main source of income as they produce crops like coconut, rice, sugar, and abaca. A great souvenir from this province would be a sample of their fine abaca made products like bags, hats, and mats.

""My driver and tour guide, Kuya Rudy Hecho, has been living in Sabtang for as long as he can remember. So much so that he's gotten used to the incredible landscapes that have brought in many tourists for the past years. And in between our cheery conversations about the Ivatan culture and some pointers on common Ivatan courtesies and words, he would tell me how tourism in the island has boomed over the past decade.

""Flocks of visitors would come every month, amazed by the grandeur of Batanes. With his unique and charming cogon-roofed tricycle, he offers guided tours around his home island, as well as accommodations for those who wish to spend the night in Sabtang. With this, he is able to support his family and, at the same time, share with his guests a part of his wonderful culture and the joys of a simple life for them to bring home as priceless memories.

I always have trouble on what shoes shall I pack when I travel. Thanks to this post, I am sure going to get a Geox product regardless if I win the voucher or not. But with the voucher, it certainly allows the let me have more pairs!$$When creating a pair of shoes, it is often a struggle between form and function. Not many can strike that fine balance between form and function -- GEOX shoes stand out not only because they have mastered this balance, but they have upped the ante by adding comfort to its highest possible level. 

I have never owned a pair of GEOX before but I truly believe that GEOX lives up to its name as I have seen a pair of GEOX that has been with my friend for almost 10 years.

Thanks in advance for this opportunity!$$Subscribed, liked & shared. Nope, I'm not winning this for myself. I'd like to win this for my mother. She would be traveling to Japan next month and the climate there is said to be really cold. She has never seen snow in her 62 years of living and she intends to wear her track shoes there as she's a thrifty woman. Therefore I sincerely hope to win this voucher so that I can buy her a pair of winter boots to keep her feet warm when she travels to Japan next month. That's the least I could do as a daughter I suppose and not let her wear track shoes while walking in the snow (: happy 2016 to you guys anyway! Cheers*!$$I should win this because Chiang Mai is a lovely place and I'm singing its praises because I have been to this city, had memorable memories and would love to return again. With its breezy mountain weather, cheap food and many cultural places of interest. It's amazing and way better than Bangkok if you are more into the Arts and Cultural sort of person. I did participate in the festivals like Loi Krathong (floating the boat on water) and Lanna (floating lanterns), it's awe- inspiring. And I wish to return to experience the wonder sight of the Sakura blooming and check off my bucket list too!$$I would like to win this for a very special someone Samantha Lee. She is my fiancee.

Geox is a trustable brand for its comfyness which is stylish, at the same time, to match with all types of outfits!

I should win as I am a big fan of GEOX especially because of its  technological innovation and Italian style.

In Geox shoes and boots, a patented system consisting of a microporous membrane placed on top of a perforated rubber sole allows heat and humidity to escape from my feet, and keeps the shoes fresh and comfortable all day. :D Despite this enhanced breathability, many Geox shoes and boots remain waterproof and that's crucial living in Singapore where it can rain anytime anywhere! :)$$Liked & Shared!

adapters for different countries are such a pain to begin with, let alone needing to charge everything I need to charge via USB from iPhone to GoPro to Power Bank to Quodos Light. (wah, see, 4 items, just nice)

no more fighting for power with my Macbook, Camera Batteries, Flash Batteries, omg - everyone travelling with me will hate me less for hogging all the power but anyways!! 

then they should just get their own xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger + power bank too hahahaa.$$Would love to have xPower PB10Q Power Bank... Always wanting to travel and capture my favourite moments. But somehow my phone goes into Low battery and did not have the chance to take my special moment! Hope this will help enhance my gadget efficacies...esp when I'm a gadget amateur!! Hope to win this!!$$Liked and shared! I would like to win the xPower PB10Q Power Bank as a birthday gift for my boyfriend! I think these power banks are made for people like my boyfriend who on internet for 24 hours, playing games, researching, snapping pictures especially, navigating at the same time even when overseas. We love traveling and will travel at least once or twice a year therefore, we really like to own this powerful gadget! (:$$i would say that xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save me when i am travelling, i need to charge my portable wifiegg and phone so that i can last a day with wifi when i travel !$$The charger is a lifesaver especially when I depend on my iPhone to capture moments on top of communicating and navigating. I also like to share the moments I capture and also revisit them during my free time. This charger ensures that there will never be a moment I can't capture. The multi 5 USB ports just makes things even better! Now 4 other friends enjoy such certainty as well (:$$I need that xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger during travelling. There's limited power supplies in the hotel room. Sometimes, u will forget to bring power extension too.

It's always a pain to charge everything at night from phones to cameras, flash batteries to Power Bank. With this awesome xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger, there will be no more hogging to the power supplies! :)$$I would love to gift the xPower WC3QT travel charger to my boyfriend as he often charges his devices (laptop and especially phone as he always play game)! It's important that he gets all his devices charged up and be ready for both school and work, and also when we travel together at a later time of this year! Since he's such a forgetful person, this multi-functional charger would benefit him a lot!$$I m always lugging around 3 portable batteries as I need to charge my iPhone and iPad! Please rescue my shoulders as they are aching everyday from the load I carry. I need xPower DC5S Charger to charge my iPad, my phone and my portable fan to keep me from fainting in this heatwave.$$The xPower PB10Q Power Bank will save my life because my phone's battery life is quite short. It would definitely need a mid-day charge if im using it actively as my GPS$$I think the xPower PB10Q Power Bank would be very apt to save my life from a dead phone. It's less a question of need but one of want, as my current portable charger is good for one charge and is the size of a KitKat. So this is less of an entry into a lucky draw, but more of a plea for a better, longer, phone life. PLEEEEEEAAAASSSEEEE$$xPower DC5S Charger will save my life whenever I'm overseas cos the number of available sockets in hotel rooms are either too far apart till my items are everywhere or there are simply not enough sockets for me to charge my phone/dslr battery/portable charger. With this, at least I can consolidate all my tech devices together without having to worry about leaving one behind! :)$$Liked & shared. I hope I can win the xPower DC5S Charger as I'll be going overseas next month & my family of 4 will be squeezing in one hotel room! This means that we need to fight for the electrical sockets to charge our devices when we reached back in our hotel room. So it would be perfect to owe the xPower DC5S Charger to increase the efficiency by charging so many our devices at the same time! Furthermore, the added advantage of the xPower DC5S Charger is that it comes with a removable handphone stand so that our devices will not be wandering around and we can save the hassle of finding them! :-)$$Liked and shared!

I definitely need the xPower DC5S Power, though it's a close fight with   xPower WC4QT Smart Travel Charger.

Given that I usually travel with someone else, getting enough power points for our numerous gadgets is a massive headache.

Count this: Camera (ok, not fair to count it cos it doesn't use USB but it does take up one power point on its own), portable power bank, phone, tablet, smart watch, and iPod (yes, I'm old skool... Cos I don't wanna drain my phone's batt.) and then multiply by the number of travelers and you roughly get the idea of how many power points we will need if not for the multi-USB charger. I can bring my own travel adaptor for just one charger and that's it.

Wei Ling Bimira, you'll agree...$$xPower DC5S Charger will definitely be a life-saver, not only for myself, but for fellow travellers in my group, especially on long road trips with no power source in sight. =)$$Item: the xPower PB10Q Power Bank. I need it to charge my phone whenever it runs out of battery whilst im overseas. Caused me to not be able to take photos and even, record beautiful moments.$$xPower PB10Q Power Bank will be my life saver!
I'm a heavy phone user and can't last a few hours without my phone!

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University‚Äôs Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don‚Äôt welcome science. They didn‚Äôt provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport‚Äôs History.
That‚Äôs Why I Couldn‚Äôt to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.

I chose Swiss-belhotel Lagoi Bay because of the review by Cheryl Tay of TheSmartLocal which mentioned Plaza Lagoi having live performances which I personally appreciate and would love to watch it when i'm there. The rooftop bar which compliments my girlfriend's love for alcohol being a Korean lol, an opportunity for me to catch up to her drinking habits! And lastly, the pool which beats the infinity pool hands down just by the view of the nature at it's best, what more can i say?

What is it?
The Filipino word for hello is ""have you eaten?"" That gives you an idea of how important food is to the people of the Philippines. Fruits, vegetables, root crops and rice are staples of the Filipino diet. And with water crisscrossing every part of the Philippines, so is fish. A traditional way of preserving them is letting them dry out under the sun. This can give them a shelf life of at least one year.

Fun Fact:
Filipinos love pairing something sweet with something salty. An example of this is eating tuyo (salty, dried fish) with champorado (porridge with cocoa) for breakfast ‚Äî a strange but surprisingly delicious combination!

It's a subtropical archipelago made up of more than 200 islands, islets and rocky outcrops","I have always liked Hong Kong... Met many nice people there... But was deeply disappointed I met a cheat recently. This Hong Konger named Chris Luk posted of extra tics to a concert. After money was transferred and we kept in touched for 2mths, he disappeared when meeting arrangements was done. Such a disgrace to Hong Kong. The mobile number he contacted on is 852 6093 8696.$$Such a wonderful place , our young family have so much good memories visiting hongkong$$Your city has a sister city relationship with Seoul, the capital of South Korea. But I question whether the majority of citizens here would be comfortable with the relationship if they knew of the horrors inflicted on hundreds of thousands of dogs in South Korea on barbaric ‚Äòmeat dog‚Äô farms. 
In South Korea, thousands of dogs are kept crammed in filthy metal cages. They‚Äôre fed on the carcasses of other dead dogs, and they‚Äôre deeply distressed from a combination of boredom and terror. 
It is the middle of a South Korean winter, there are dogs shivering and whimpering in freezing, open cages. They live their entire lives in factory farm conditions. They have no freedom, no affection, nothing that makes them feel good. And they‚Äôll be butchered so humans can eat their meat. I have heard of the atrocities‚Äîof dogs and cats being boiled alive. Of dogs being baked. Of family dogs being stolen and cooked. The fact that people know this happens and turns a blind eye is not acceptable. To do this is to condone the dog meat trade. It is despicable and one of the basest practices that happens as an industry on this planet. 
As Mahatma Gandhi once said, ‚ÄúThe greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.‚Äù
I ask that your publication bring attention to two important issues: 
‚Ä¢	the existence of the dog meat trade in South Korea

The first stage. All stages will be three.
The sources of rivers - is washed with water gorge. Between two mountains set 10 baths. Obtain a ladder height of 100 meters. Water flows from the tenth to the ninth bath tub. With nine baths - in the eighth, and so on to the bottom of the bath. From the bottom of the bath water flows in a specially dug the lake - an area 4.3 square kilometers - storage of cold water.
Production of crystal clear enriched in trace elements and chilled fresh water.
The principle of operation of the technology. Know height growth per km, provides cooling of 6.7 degrees. That is, the water bath cools in the tenth to 0.67 degrees, at the bottom - by 0,067, and the average - to 0.335 degrees. How much does it - a lot or a little? - There Are Many. Increase in global temperature of 0.05 degrees. Divide one by the other, and we get the result: technology has reduced the temperature of the inflow of 6.7 times. This is a great indicator. Such technologies on the rivers of the Philippines will need as much as possible - up to 25-30 pieces. They will cool in a month and all the rivers before flowing into the ocean. Rivers will evaporate less moisture, that is, will be replenished.
This technology Philippines can build without me. A month later, you will get positive results, and call me. I will bring more powerful technology, and all the rivers of the Philippines will be restored. It will irrigate arid lands and pastures. Build new farms.

Siquijor, Visayas

How to Get There:
Take a boat from Cebu to Siquijor.

What is it?
The island is famous for its virgin beaches and secret swimming spots. But the thing about Siquijor that probably resonates the most is its reputation for magic and sorcery. During Good Friday, the island is supposedly the go-to place of witchdoctors from all over the country who are looking to recharge their amulets.

Fun Fact:
Local healers can concoct potions made from oils and herbs for visitors to take home. A scented lana (coconut oil-based ointment) made by a healer is believed to relieve one of stomach aches and body pains.

Big thanks to everyone for participating, and to Quayside Isle for sponsoring this giveaway :)$$10 Reasons I would like to spend Christmas at Quayside Isle!

1. It's my birthday on Christmas!
2. I could never have a fancy meal around because everything is so expensive on Christmas!
3. I was actually intending to save some money this Christmas by staying at home so the husband don't have to spend so much..
4. As we are saving money for our future flat and can't afford a holiday..
5. Hence travelling to Quayside Isle could be like a 'getaway' from Singapore!
6. I have NEVER been to this side of Singapore....
7. And since I don't have a car and am saving money.. The transportation accommodation is perfect!
8. I've never splurge on fanciful Italian, Spanish or any International fare - Closest was vouchers from friends at Lawry's Prime Ribs.
9. Have you seen Rebel Wilson did that Hydro Jetpack thing?!
10. I REALLY WANNA WIN THIS! üò≠$$My QUAY reason is that it's a nice tranquil place to spend Christmas with family by my SIDE and therefore ISLE really like to go there!$$With Quayside Isle being such a Instagram-worthy place, the ""ulu"" distance ain't gonna stop me from going because we all know it's definitely WORTH IT! And why squeeze at Orchard Road when we can get to experience Xmas from all over the world at Quayside Isle, right?? Haha :D Plus the Xmas promotions & shopping...OMG it's literally the perfect mini getaway! Oh! And my family had a staycation at W last year; waking up to that insanely gorgeous yacht sea view was seriously a dream come true! Sentosa is always my happy place to be, which is why I'd LOVE to be able to spend Xmas at Quayside Isle this year!! There's just no other place I'd rather be!! :D Liked & shared! (Here's some photos that I took when I was at Quayside Isle! Now I miss this beautiful place so so much!) TheSmartLocal.com Quayside Isle @ Sentosa Cove$$I think it would be great to celebrate Christmas at Quayside Isle instead of the usual Orchard.  I love the sea, boats and beautiful scenery where I can take alot of nice selfes and wefies.  Would invite my Malaysian cousins for some delicious food  when they come to visit in Christmas. I'm sure they will love in love with the lovely place.  :D 
liked n shared$$I have not been to the  Quayside Isle before so it would great to have brand new experience this year  to create new memories with my loved one                 :3 
liked n shared$$Having been to Quayside isle several times , it is unlike like any other places Singapore , always packed and crowded with people . Having no time to travel out of Singapore during the xmas season, quayside isle is the best place to be at , to celebrate the festive season with our love ones, which will give us a out of Singapore feel.$$I hope to win this vouchers at Quayside Isle vouchers üòç 

I have never been to Quayside and I never thought it is so beautiful and less crowded as compared to town areas (especially during Christmas). Both my boyfriend and I hated squeezing in the crowd! It would be a great idea to spend my Christmas with my boyfriend Chua Hien Eng there which gives us the feeling of being out of Singapore during this festive season! As its really expensive to travel overseas during this festive season. With the awesome view, we can take many Instagram worthy photos together and have our mini photo shoot there! It would be great walking along Quayside Isle together hand in hand and spending quality time together. I believe this would be a great place for us to escape from our hectic life ‚ò∫Ô∏è$$Liked n shared . It's a different part of Singapore ... Where one can relax and chill away from the hustle and bustle of the city and the marina and yachts docked by Quayside isle bring waterfront to a whole different level !$$I‚Äôd like to spend Christmas at Quayside Isle because I have not been to this place, and it would be great to bring my wife to  Quayside Isle for a change in environment too. This place may bring new surprises to us.$$I'd like to spend this Christmas with our little one who will be turning 2 months soon. This would be his first Christmas! 

It would be lovely to spend it at Quayside Isle as a family. To enjoy the evening by having a sumptuous dinner & dessert in one of the restaurants and take a stroll along the quay afterwards for some photo taking time!

Let's hope to be chosen and make this first Christmas a special one for us, the Wongs :) üòò
Kyle Wong 
Ho Eleanor Ron Chng Pearly Ling Choo Ang Galvin Ng Lin Guan$$Its the perfect and tranquil place to spend the Christmas Eve over at Quayside Isle along with my significant other. Where we could just simply people watch or chat to our hearts content over what we had achieved in the year by the night lights and stars above.  Ahhhh~ I am so tempted to rush down just by the thought of it. Hope luck is on my side so that I can win the vouchers and truly enjoy my sumptuous dinner at any of the restaurant. Jonathan Tanüòò$$Because its a serene enclave from the hustle and bustle of the city and with paranomic views of the sea along with tantalising delights which I simply can't resist, why else but Quayside Isle right? :) 

P.S: Wasn't paid by CDL or its tenants to say this.$$Christmas has always been mundane/just-another-day for us since we never liked joining the crowds. Thus, I believe Quayside Isle is THE place to go if we'd like to enjoy some quiet time and soak in the Christmas festive at the same time!$$Spent a month working here during my post-As last year, and told myself i'd definitely be back - only this time to enjoy the gorgeous seaview with my family. But when uni started, i got carried away with the assignments, projects, hall commitments and suppers, and haven't been to quayside isle since. It's a year late but i'll be bringing them this dec, and it'll be really, really amazing if i could treat them to a good meal by the sea (freshly made, piping hot pizza? yes pls!!!) it'd be the perfect christmas getaway for us!!$$I had been to Quayside Isle before,it is so nice like overseas.The scenery is nice with sea,boata and nice scenery.I can take alot of nice pictures.$$Liked and shared
Hope to win can bring my wife and kids celebrate Christmas n my early birthday at a nice scenery and less crowded place.As bringing kids to crowded place inconvenient too.$$All I want for Christmas is to spend more time with my family and daughter. 

As a busy working mother,  ive definitely missed out on the time i spend with my family and missing some milestones achieved by my daughter. But when I come home, my daughter will run to the door and give me a big hug, and everything that's happened that day just melts away. We love food from Quayside Fish Bar & Bistro so it'll be great to have a party this Christmas at Quayside Isle @ Sentosa Cove
Liked and shared$$I love to bring my mother to have a wonderful time at the Quayside Isle.  Ever since she discharged from hospital, she has been at home and feeling bored so I like to treat her to a yummy meal and walk around the beautiful place and take some nice photos <3$$I‚Äôd like to spend Christmas with my husband at Quayside Isle because it's a beautiful and romantic place, especially during the Christmas season. The dining options look good too.$$A promise to a special someone: To keep her smiling everyday. To bring her experiences and memories that will last a lifetime. To keep the sparks and magic alive in every date. 

Celebrating Christmas at Quayside Isle is my next milestone to meeting this promise. Help me fulfill it.$$I‚Äôd like to spend Christmas at Quayside Isle because it's definitely a better alternative compared to the crowded town area. Other than feeling like you are outta Singapore, having a quieter Christmas will be good. :)$$There was once where my wife and I were ""stuck"" among the crowds at Orchard Road during Christmas day. It was a horrible experience.So now, we would rather spend a quiet and peaceful Christmas day together at home. We did not know of any happening events at Quayside Isle, and also the place is quite far from our home and may be a little too quiet for us. I am looking for some place new for us to visit and after reading the website, I'm keen to go there for our Christmas celebration this year. It seems like a secret place hidden in Singapore with gems inside!$$I would like to spend this Christmas at Quayside Isle as it would be an unique experience for my friends and I. We usually hang out in bars or pubs and after so many years, it is time for a change. A different and exotic silent night!

Ah, Boracay. Need we say more? Since much has been said, raved and written about this famous four-kilometer stretch of powder white sand paradise, we would like to suggest you try the most exhilarating activity off it ‚Äî cliff-diving at Ariel's Point. The highest plank is about 15 meters high, which is as high as a five-storey building. But a jump off it ends with a safe, pleasantly wet landing.

Not a lot of people know that Tribal Adventure Day Tours are offered on this island. These are no ordinary tours. You spend an entire day getting to know the indigenous people living In the area.

Model: Alicia Teng ","Update: As of 27th June, Fish & Chicks has a new outlet in the basement of Cineleisure. YAY!!$$i get that it is nice, but fish skins, burgers, fish and chips, crabs, come on la.... there are nicer things to eat right. lol$$Tried it recently. Not worth the hype. Can't really taste the salted egg nor the chilli crab. As good as eating the normal fish and chips.$$The worst fish & chips I have ever tasted. Waited for 3hrs, fish over cooked & zero salted egg taste. Not worth for money & time.$$Went over at 6pm on Friday. No Q. Ordered for 2 pax. Even clarified with the staff whether it was only that 1 plastic bag to take away. Reached home, zero sides. Gravy too sweet, batter tasteless. Didn't go back to change as we don't live nearby and we had a sick baby to look after. As a food establishment that allows and handles tabaos.. We felt cheated of our 4 sides.$$Please do not waste your time with this store. 

The salted egg had no inkling of salted egg in it. It tasted like some mashed potato sauce. 

The Chili crab tasted like Chili crab, but slightly diluted. It did not go well with fish and chips at all. 

Garlic rice was nothing special. Just oily rice with a hint of garlic. Tom yum rice is a disaster and can't even be called Tom yum rice. 

Herb infused fish, tastes like sour, salty fish. 

I am not being harsh, but the food they sell isn't worth travelling to experience. It's below mediocre and I'd rather opt for the kopitiam food below my house.$$Went at 925pm and they were already closed. Chefs were still cooking and the counter still had the 15min waiting time board on. Counter staff rudely told us ""sorry we are closed"" while closing cash register and not having any eye contact. Oh wells.

I.
The world we live in, has become a battlefield, 
Between the innocent and the evil.
The people we love, becomes a slave no one heals,
Because of the dreadfulness that tempts them to kill.

II.
Innocent lives have been taken to oblivion,
The people behind this may not feel the frustrations.
Of their families, friends, and their children's children,
Making this a dark and sorrowful world we live in.

III.
After years and years of sorrow and pain,
It's our time that peace and unity should be maintained.
Let us hold hand-in-hand to eliminate all evilness,
Until our world becomes a planet of happiness.

IV.
Let us shout for freedom, unity, and peace,
Our God looks at our world with hope and ease.
One day, all sources of evil shall vanish before our eyes,
Making the planet we live in, peaceful and unified.

This doesn't mean that borders are closed.
It is easy to criticsize a country and its politic from his computer but harder to prove it especially when that person who criticsize don't even live there.
Thank you to not ruin the image of a country that is facing several stress for the past three days already.

From a french citizen and proud pinoy.$$The people of Mindanao have suffered with what the people if Paris lived with for one day for the last 10 years plus Paris should fly the Philippines flag.$$This is a fitting reminder to note that Dr. Jose Rizal as well as other Filipino Patriots were Freemasons. Rizal became also a member of the Grand Orient (the equivalent of a Grand Lodge today) of France as per available historical records. Thus, if our national heroes were inspired by the masonic principles of ""Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"" way back then, so was France during the French Revolution. I am sure that ""Kuyang Dimas Alang or Dimasalang"" - the masonic name of Jose Rizal which was customary during the time wouldn't mind having his monument be draped in the national colors of France. May ""Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"" triumph over religious fanaticism & ignorance once more.$$We stand for world peace! Not for selective humanity!$$the colors of the philippine flag...$$Salamat po , merci,thank you, it's very important to feel supported by the internationnale community. I love my country, France, with all my heart.  I fell in love with your country, Philippines, with your culture and with your citizens, but this temoignge of sympathy make me uncomfortable. France would make it the same thing for you? Has she already made it in past? But again thank you!$$doesnt necessarily mean that you change your facebook pic into the tri color french flag therefore you remain deaf to the cry of the rest of the world,
otherwise using that kind of logic means that we are merely depending on the numbers of casualties and not the problem itself,
you might suggest turkish, afghan, iraqi, syrian flag and other african nations as an alternative,
its not about the french craze or western imperialism that we do so, rather it is the fact that those people are also victims of senseless killing and we cannot just accept any feasible reason to justify that.
my profile pic is not in question in here,  so long as your sentiments and prayers goes to the victims and you do not tolerate those acts is actually the point,
and you are one with the world in agony of condemning terrorist of murdering people in the name of an alien principle which is not human at all,
in fact how many billion dollars was and is presently donated to the syrian civil war victims - the world knows exactly what we are facing today
even world leaders are quick to respond just by the picture of the toddlers dead body on the shore
even Germany the mastermind of genocide of jews are welcoming these refugee is now doing the exact opposite.

you do not sympathize in regards to killing as to the number of victims,
this is not a poll related matters or survey,
its like saying, since turkish bombing provides greater casualties therefore turkish flag is better and because paris attacks recorded only a 100+ death toll maybe we have to used the french flag next week or next month,
does it makes sense?
otherwise if we subscribe to that kind of mentality then we are literally moving backward.

cguro kung uso na yung fb nung 9/11 cguro nagkulay america na ung fb not because of its superiority among nations but simply because those acts of terrors are really out of reasons!! its not human!!!
and that sentiments is shared among nations regardless of status and not just by a marginalized group.$$i admire , the Filipino people. United we Stand, Divided we Fall........ im from Austria, im proud to be  Filipina....$$Hypocrisy at its best... Remember SAF44? 'Misencounter' and didnt even attend the arrival honors... We stand in France But I Duck and care not to my fellow Filipinos.. :@$$Pray not just for Paris but for the world... Especially for the Lumads that was killed by PNoy Allies.$$Why do people have to turn something meant to be supportive to Paris/France into a subject of inequality or hypocrisy? I have the French colors as a part of my profile picture not because I live in France or to jump the bandwagon but because I share the same belief of condemning these attacks wherever they happen. Period.$$I actually see the Philippine flag though. Red, blue, white, and yellow in the middle of white. :))$$These people are so stupid. When Haiyan struck the Philippines, even France set aside its own problems to help our country. We are just doing the same for them now. This is not even an issue of who is supporting what. We are showing our support because we are being decent humans.$$parang phillippine flag color lang di pero amg ganda lets pray for the victims of paris france victims and hope that war will stop as soon as possible and let peaceful country be free again against the terrorist.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Great for lunch the next day!
2) bring my own Tupperware if I know I'm gg to buy food back for lunch in office etc 
3) reduce use of plastic bags by not asking for/returning plastic bags at places like bubble tea shops. Also bring my own bag when I go marketing. Drives the stall holders crazy but I have significantly reduced my plastic bag consumption 
4) use newspaper to pick up dogs poo instead of plastic bags. 100% biodegradable!
5) recycle every paper made carton or plastic container that comes through my house$$1. Don't use paper tissues. A cloth handkerchief is evergreen and very useful.
2. Invest in a cloth Tote bag and carry it to the supermarket. Say no to plastic bags.
3. Recycle properly and segregate your waste properly.
4. Don't waste water and instruct your house help to turn off taps when not using. Install low capacity showers n cisterns at home. Don't overwater plants in your garden and use water left from washing Vegetables to water plants.
5. Don't print unnecessary documents. Use e- tickets, e- receipts etc. Ask your bank to send you email statements. Same for utility bills, mobile bills etc. 
6. Donate old clothes, books, bags etc. 
7. Don't waste food. Leftover veggies and meat can be used as stuffing for sandwiches or rolls. Cook/order only how much you can eat.
8. Try and use reusable utensils, bottles etc.
9. Carry a plastic bag in your handbag always. Use it to carry stuff during emergencies or impulse shopping or your umbrella. Dry it and use it again. I see people wasting a lot of plastic bags for their umbrellas at work or in malls.
 That's all from me folks üòä$$Firstly, watch this video to feel inspired: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDQcBQUDpw It has to begin with a lifestyle change. Fret not, baby steps!                                           1) Just like the Meghan Trainer song, say ""NO"" to things like straws in your drink, plastic or paper bags at stores, and receipts                                                                  2) Make a grocery list when you go shopping to avoid buying impulse items                                                                                               3) Attempt buying 2nd hand clothes/bags instead of new ones (one man's trash is another man's treasure!                                            4) Buy detergent and dish soap in boxes instead of plastic bottles. Cardboard can be more easily recycled and made into more products than plastic                                                                                   5) Whenever possible, bring your own reusable container to dabao food or bring home your restaurant leftovers                                      6)Instead of buying juice in plastic bottles, make your own fresh-squeezed juice or simply eat fresh fruit. Not only does this cut down on plastic waste, but it's also better for you because you'll be getting more vitamins and antioxidants and less high fructose corn syrup:)       John Oliver said it best in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xwLWb0lLY, 1 earth, we got to do our part for it;)$$[W]ELL, you've got to challenge yourself to reduce food wastage today with the tips below! :)

[A]VOID cluttering the fridge, freezer and pantry. Pack things neatly and visibly, always move older products to the front so you consume them first.

[S]PLIT or SHARE the giant portion dish if eating out with friends so you don‚Äôt waste the large sized portions usually served in restaurants.

[T]HINK before shopping and cooking. Try shopping with a list with necessary food items on it and shop with meals in mind. Cook while thinking of making use of leftover food ensuring you eat everything you buy.

[E]XPIRATION dates suggest how long the product is likely to remain at its best quality when unopened, but it's not a safety date. Hence most foods like unopened item properly stored stay fresh past the ‚Äúuse-by‚Äù date. Don't throw these food immediately after the expiration date is due.$$I try to reduce wastage doing the following:
1) buy condiments in the smallest size possible, so there is a higher chance of using them up before expiry.  same with produce.  anyway, fresher is better
2) I try not to cook more than the amount that my family can consume. well, if they are not full after eating, just eat more fruits later on!
3) i freeze ripe fruits like grapes, strawberries, blueberries and bananas if i see that my family won't be finishing them any time soon
4) i use my own shopping bag instead of plastic bags.$$1. I always bring my own tupperware when I go out to eat! Used my own container for places like acai project (below!), cocowhip etc:)
2. I minimise the amount of packaging I consume by using my own bags when I go grocery shopping and by supporting eco products like a biodegradable toothbrush so that whatever I throw away can return to the earth! I also use handkerchiefs instead of tissue paper because every little bit counts, no?$$I didn't have frozen spring onion pancakes so I fried a roti prata in spring onion oil. 
I didn't have spicy bean paste so I used hoisin and chilli oil. 

Tadah: Easy Jian Bing 

1. Make it a point to just use whatever u have at home.
2. Scour the web for easy recipes that look good to u. 
3.Experiment with flavours.

Credit to thewoksoflife for inspiration$$When life gives you left overs from last night, make an aglio olio with everything on it :-) I also make omelets with left over potatoes and meat. Other than this, we segregate our trash at home and put them at the disposal bins below our apartment for recycling.  The food waste and other biodegradable items are put in a bin and are being used by the gardeners for the plants. Nothing is wasted in our apartment :-)$$Buy only what you will eat within the week so you dont waste food which expire or spoil easily.

Also, try to make takeaway boxes to lunch from overnight food. Eg, making fried rice from leftover rice and adding some ingredients.

Share your food if the portion is too big so there is no wastage! You can even use parts of food like the skin of fruits as fertilizer to your plants! <3$$1) I use the fibres leftover from juicing fruit juice as plant fertilisers n DIY face mask
2) Bring along a container to my canteen when buying food. It's also role modelling to the kids in my school.
3) Use leftover food and recreate another new dish the next day. For example I used leftover fried rice to make cheese baked rice!
4) Basically my rule of thumb is to try reusing everything more than once when possible. 

Maximise usage to minimise waste!$$1. When you have fresh vegetables in your fridge and you know you'll be eating out for the next few days (as Singaporeans do!) blanch them and store in a ziplock in the freezer for future use! Saves the veg from going bad, and saves cooking time for the next time you need to whip up a quick meal!

2. Use all vegetable scraps (carrot skins, celery bases, onion tops/bases, etc) to make your own homemade vegetable stock instead of throwing them away

3. Bring your own Tupperware when tabaoing food outside. It saves the use of plastic/styrofoam disposable boxes, and if you can't finish your food, you already have it stored in a Tupperware which you can keep in your fridge to finish up or repurpose into another meal later!$$Be Minimalist by 
1. Cultivate our mind & emotions.
2. Focus on the essentials - consume less but enjoy more.
3. Appreciate the art of making something. Eg: Hardwork of farming/cooking or sewing clothes/shoes.
4. Strive for better yet not marginalize others.$$Reduce food waste by:
1) buy only required quantity 
2) cook only portions that can be consumed
3) can't finish, put food in Tupperware and store in the fridge for following day's consumption 
4) share big quantity food  neighbors and friends 
5) avoid being too greedy when dine out and order too many food 
6) don't be kiasu and can't finish food taken during buffet time 
7) bear in mind many children are starving at less developed countries 
8) generous in food donations to needy families$$1. Cook only the amount you and your family are able to eat, the remain ingredient could keep to use tmr. If there any part which not able to eat such as veg head/root. Feed to pet living in the house. If no pet, cut into smaller pieces and buried into your plant soil.

2. Left over food can either feed to dog or keep in a container into the fridge. 

3. If eat outside, ask for less rice or request small plate and share with other. 

4. If no appetite to eat anything, and u hungry, have a meal replacement instead, such as protein shake or cereal.$$My family is a coffee drinker and we brew fresh coffee every morning, instead of wasting the brewed coffee ground, we use it as plant fertilizer and DIY anti cellulite body scrub! And instead of throwing unused vegetables away, we use it to re-grow new plants and harvest new vegetables for the family to eat home grown organic vegetables. And instead of throwing peeled fruit skin, we use it to clean dishes (leftover lemon skin), Polish shoes (leftover banana skin), we also use orange skin as DIY room freshener (no chemical) and so many more! Here are my tips to live green to reduce waste ‚ù§Ô∏è$$1. Order about 5-10% less than what you think you will need 
2. Allocate leftovers for the next meal
3. Drink more water / eat more fibre related foods to fill more full easily$$We bought a steamboat stove with grill plate. Cook on spot what you want to eat, remaining can cook other dishes or make sandwich/salad/wrap for next day! üòâ$$Buy in moderation and clear everything in the fridge before buying more... Keep lookout for clearance sales in Marts and have a budget in mind before shopping...$$Thanks TheSmartLocal.com for the generous giveaway! Some of my tips are:

1) Reuse/ recycle - e.g. used yakult bottles can be washed and be used as stationeries holders
2) Be kiasu - bring your own container/reusable bags when buying things
3) Go electronically - avoid/minimize printing of papers
4) Donate useful items to charitable organisations 
5) Compost food waste (my company is currently doing it!)
6) Pass on the list to others!

Hope to be one of the lucky winners! ^^$$Before the currency was invented, people trade. They trade livestocks, food for services, clothes for food, among others. And this is one of the ways we can reduce our waste. Instead of buying new clothes, we can trade our old clothes with our friends for some new or fresh styles. How about trading your old crib for some new toys for your kids? You can buy plenty of secondhand clothes and items online. They are cheaper and you are actually recycling too :-) We minimise the use of resources this way. Great way to go green!$$We minimize waste in our home by:

1) Segregating our trash and putting them in the recycling bins.

2) Up-cycling glass bottles and plastic containers. We turned the old ice cream container into an art organizer for my kid and the oatmeal container into a toy jar. It's good to teach them young about the value of recycling. 

And of course, the glass bottle is turned into a vase and spice jars. I but my spices in bulk and use the old glass jars to store them in. 

3) Use cotton re-usable diapers instead of the disposable ones. I save a lot of money and I save the environment too because I reduce the amount of plastic being thrown out. Also, instead of using serviettes or kitchen papers, use a washable dish towel for wiping surfaces. 

4) To reduce energy wastage, we open the windows to let the sunshine and the air in so we don't have to turn on the lights or use the airconditioning all the time.

Every little bit helps. Joy Sung join :-)$$1) Shop smart during grocery shopping. We go to the supermarket three times a week, once during the weekends and twice during weekday nights and buy groceries for our cooking. This way, we will not ""overstock"".

2. When eating out, i will order for the family with two young girls but not myself. This way, I can finish up the leftover food. 

3. In the event of leftovers after a cooked meal, we will store them in the fridge, reheat the next day and packed them for lunch in the office

4. We store our food in correct places. Fruits which does not require refrigeration must be stored in a cool dry place to maximise their life span. 

5. Adopt FIFO concept when storing food in the fridge. Always consume the food you put in the fridge first. 

6. Buy pre loved toys for the children and hand them down to orher children. 

7. Bring your old bags when doing shopping$$If only there's some form of platform or app for people to share certain items and can buy together eg: I probably only need 100ml out of 300ml of soya sauce as I don't cook often, or 2kg out of 10kg rice etc, yet paying lesser. This will keep wastage to the minimum since you only buy what you need. By recycling the bottles or packaging you had used before, helps to keep wastage to the lowest too.$$After we have gotten our new home, we have to shop and manage our things wisely as all the things bought means $$ going out.
Towards a Zero Waste Challenge:
1) Research for recipes that we want to whip up and buy what we need instead of buying the ingredients first and think of what dishes to cook.
2) If we have unused food in fridge, we'll research for dishes that require them! 
E.g. We bought a packet of 5 salmon fillets, we've tried baking it and pan frying it! We'll always have packets of potatoes and carrots in our fridge as it's always easy to make a meal with roasted veggies! Whenever we bake fish/chicken, we can always pair it with roasted veggies. This helps us to ensure we eat healthily and we do not have too much unused food in the fridge!
3) If we bake a cake or make any desserts, we'll share them with our parents or friends so that they don't go bad in the fridge and our family and friends will also give us feedback to improve our desserts!
4) I'll always use the envelopes for my bills as rough paper. I do not have to search for foolscap or notepad!

But it'll be better if it provided with some photos too :) People may think KTO is for tourists only. But for me who have stayed in Korea for almost 8 months for study, i really think that this page n website is very functional esp for break holidays. I think KTO should provide more informations about unfamiliar places in Korea. And also for guide how to get there,, food and accomodation available there, and maybe some activities availabe. And it should be great if KTO provide some informations about the transportation, such where can we rent a van or a bus for trip :) last summer break, we had gone for a really enjoyable trip because of informations provided in KTO üíúüíú thank u KTO :D So i hope to see others to enjoy their trip during their stay at Korea too like me n friends. $$For me both A. Photo/video-oriented content and B. Information-oriented content, because these can easily captivate or fascinate the interest of the excursionist or rubbernecker. They are both functional especially to me as non native because during my free time here in Korea, KTO page will be my guide in exploring interesting and beautiful places were in photos, videos and information about the places that can be seen in Korea will help in motivating us because it will be delivered complex information through a real life context. Kamsahamnida Korea Tourism Organization$$I think both. A. Photo/Video - oriented content, and B. Information - oriented  content. 

     They are same useful and very effective way to attract  travelers to visit a place like Jeju island, Seoul Namsan tower, Suwon Hwaseong Fotress and other tourist destination  or to go around the city like Seoul, Incheon, Busan and other places in Korea by using transportation system  like bus, subway, taxi and other mode of transportation or going to event and festival or want to taste korean food specially kimchi. Both content  with specific details it really makes help to the travellers to explore more about Korea and to go in a place/tourist destination with a organize plan and schedules.

     Base on my experience i always  love to visit a place with a brief knowledge about the place and specially always inspire me a lot to visit a place where i'm going on.

     So for me my answer are A and B content, i would like to see both content on KTO page and the combination of two it would be great. Because they are same important and informative. 

     Thank you...$$B) information abt budget tips at korea etc food,accomodation, transport..tips for those like to stay longer at korea like work or study and more info abt halal food..$$For me the two categories A and B are important because the information be explained strengthen it when the image or video

1180,67558139928_10153554682914929,"Batik is a technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to whole cloth, or cloth made using this technique. The word of batik is derived from the word ‚Äúambatik‚Äù which means ‚Äúa cloth with little dots‚Äù. The suffix ‚Äútik‚Äù means ‚Äúlittle dot, drop, point or to make dots‚Äù. Batik may also originate from the Javanese word ‚Äútritik‚Äù which describes a resist process for dying where the patterns are reserved on the textiles by tying and sewing areas prior to dying, similar to tie dye techniques. Another Javanese phase for the mystical experience of making batik is ‚Äúmbatik manah‚Äù which means ‚Äùdrawing a batik design on the earth‚Äù.

Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting or by printing resist with a copper stamp called a cap. The applied wax itself resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to color selectively by soaking the cloth in the one color, removing the wax with boiling water and repeating the process if multiple colors are desired.

Batik which made in the island of Java has a long history of acculturation, with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures, and is the most developed in terms of pattern, technique and the quality of workmanship. On October 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian Batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. http://ow.ly/RydRE

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one üòÇüòÇ damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london üòçüòç my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it üòÇ$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin ‚Äì Singapore‚Äôs 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy!

Overall great article.$$did the sea urchins thing :) did taste nice at that moment :)$$8 Things You Shouldn't Forget To Do When Traveling Around The Philippines.

1. Don't for get to get ripped-off my the Taxi Drivers at the Airports (MNL and Clk mostly.) The same with Trike Drivers at Tourist spots. It may not be much for you. But that amount of money could be as much as some poor guy breaking his back in a rice field.

2. Don't forget the food Totally SUCKS; Caveat the street Chicken or some BBQ.
If you can't make you‚Äôre own food there, ask expats where to find decent food.

3. Don't learn the Language; you'll be wasting your time, unless you stay in one place or with a group of friends. There's three different Languages here -- plus English. English is the 'common' language. If you don't know English, learn that one.

4. If you miss home, go to a mall... Half the Malls here are very nice... The other half are like something you'd see in  developed countries 40-years ago.

5. If you make new friends, realize they share an OZ of beer with you, they'd expect 16 OZs in return.

6. 'Keep it Clean.' There's trash and shit all over the place here... but, us foreigners don't really litter anyway.

7. Support the locals, but, not the Tourist Scammers (Taxi, Street People, and whatnot.) You can go to the local Sari-sari (small, rustic, 'convinces' store.) and buy what you can from there. They're regular families working, trying to make a honest living in a place that is difficult to do so.

For non-divers ‚Äì the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

""... After Peter (not his real name) asked for a divorce, his wife took their baby daughter, returned to her parents' home and refused to let him see the child. She also changed her phone number and cut off all contact with him. Later, she moved out of her parents' home and Peter had no clue how to locate her or his child.""

""... To help safeguard the interests of children, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will have more agencies providing a supervised visitation programme by the end of next year. Currently, only the THK Centre for Family Harmony offers such programmes for separated or divorced parents to see their children.

Maid do housework, homemaker do what?

""... Reality check in gender equality in Singapore. However, given the reality - supported by surveys - that the burden of care for children and the elderly still falls largely on the shoulders of women, current laws remain relevant. Giving a divorced woman maintenance is a way of levelling the playing field for her in a system that devalues her non-market contributions to the marriage. This is the unpaid work at home and the opportunity cost of not having a job and thereby not having the updated skills needed for future employment.""

""... Man charged with murder of son, 5. The Belgian expatriate who has been accused of killing his five-year-old son was yesterday remanded for three weeks at the medical complex in Changi Prison for psychiatric evaluation.

Restrained at the wrists, and escorted by plainclothes policemen, 41-year-old Philippe Marcel Guy Graffart arrived at the State Courts in the morning in an unmarked police car looking dazed and tired.

He stood expressionless in the dock as the charge of murdering his boy, Keryan Gabriel Cedric Graffart, was read out.

No plea was taken from Graffart, who was dressed in a black T-shirt and blue shorts. He was observed looking around the public gallery.
None of his family members or friends was in court.

A day before, police had found him with self-inflicted injuries outside Bukit Timah Neighbourhood Police Centre just after 5am.

After he was sent to hospital, police went to his 32nd-storey apartment at the posh D'Leedon condominium in Leedon Heights. There, they found Keryan dead in a bedroom. Hand-shaped bruises were apparently found all over his neck.

According to the charge read to Graffart yesterday, he is accused of killing Keryan in the apartment some time between 8.54pm on Monday and 5.29am on Tuesday...""$$What's the point of feedback? Nobody is listening. MSF probably already have their ""ownself think ownself"" intended changes for women's charter prepared before public consultation. Public consultation is for show only, no?

Our society is still so outdated, still not ready for women to step out of the traditional role of homemaker/ kitchen/ Stone Age/ Feudal Era where men work and women breed? How many family/ household can cope with single income source?

Officially, I can announce my child is PARENTAL ALIENATED ISOLATED HIDDEN KIDNAP BRAINWASH BY PARENTAL ALIENATION TERRORIST when the judge ask me if I want access (interim court order?) to see my children, of course no, why do I need a court order, when I repeatedly ask the judge 3-4 times, am I denied access, NO, I am not denied access by court order, why do I need an court order for access to children if I am not denied access, so why should I negotiate terms and conditions with Parental Alienation Terrorist: their facilitator/ collaborator from the government agency Ministry Of Social Family and Development (MSF)/ MSF registered VWOs.

Rubbish government agency/ VWOs registered with government agency practices? Whoever from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)/ MSF registered VWOs that are facilitating hiding of 6yo minor/ my daughter info WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights) since November 2013, better come clean and admit it.?

Not the truth?

Singapore Police Force (SPF) latest reply still cannot produce any single evidence that can prove the status (dead, alive or missing) of my daughter, state her whereabout via written reply.

I really have doubt and confidence in SPF handling/ investigating/ response of missing 6yo minor in Singapore.

I will assume my daughter is still missing. Until proven otherwise, police report will continue to be make for missing 6yo minor. Unless there is evidence to prove otherwise, I still do not know or no one can prove where and how is my daughter since November 2013.

Has SPF make any investigation or taken any action against MSF/ MSF registered VWOs that are facilitating hiding of 6yo minor/ 6yo minor's info from her father WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights) since November 2013. They are the last known organisation that are facilitating hiding of a 6yo minor/ my daughter info based on email/ letter correspondence dated in 2014.

If SPF has done their due diligent investigation and concluded that my daughter is safe at a known location, why information of my daughter is not disclosed to me via written reply? Who is facilitating hiding and withholding information of my daughter WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights) from her father? Is this kidnapping/ hiding/ withholding a 6yo minor info from her father in Singapore?

I come back to the same question. I have not received any family court order that I am denied access to information of my daughter? So where is my daughter (dead, alive or missing)? Which government agency/ government registered organisation: MSF/ MSF registered VWOs is facilitating hiding of my daughter (now 6yo minor, missing since 4yo in November 2013), better come clean and admit it.? Is this kidnapping/ hiding/ withholding a 6yo minor info from her father in Singapore WITHOUT family court order (no denied access/ revoke custody/ revoke father's parental rights)

Let‚Äôs find out why they are said like this.
Maybe one of reasons is using natural material cosmetics in a daily life.

Tsubaki oil (camellia-seed oil) used since 7th century, is effective in moisturizing and cutting off ultraviolet rays. Not only women use, sumo wrestlers use it to tie up their hair, and kabuki actors use it as their make-up base. 
Azuki bean has been used as skincare among upper class ladies from the ancient time. It accelerates blood flow, therefore it is good for getting rid of pimples and smoothing your skin. 
Komenuka (rice bran) is highly praised for its effect on beautifying skin. Its vitamins remove spots and works for anti-aging. 

For your information, cosmetics will be one of the tax-free products since this October.
It would be wonderful to buy Japanese cosmetics that suit your skin condition.

Now I can utilize it for my month end trip to run at Standarard Chartered Marathon in KL!   Whoopee!! Thanks a million!$$JB for weekend grocery shopping & good value dinner. Move a little more Melaka, place for heritage trail & night market jonker street. specialty food of satay, luk luk steamboat & my favorite of cheesy. steamboat. Kuala Lumpur great city for shopping. Great shopping malls at Bukit.Bintang & great food street like Alor. Genting great place for Young & Old. A get away place from the hot weather. Great mountain, white beaches, different tribes are just the many reasons for East Malaysia.  A great close destination, our neighbour, Malaysia Truly Asia.....$$Malaysia offers one of the most ideal destination for travel. Malaysia offers a varied range of activities from the highlands of Cameron Highlands and the lush greenery of the oldest rainforest to the white sandy beaches. There is always that city limelights that beckons you for a night out of fun or self indulgence. The ethnic diversity is shared in the myriad colours in traditional wear, the culinary delight that is shared by all and the warmth welcoming hospitality greeted you as you travel around Malaysia . From the Portugese settlers in Melaka to the unique Baba culture to the 3 main ethnic group, there is always an experience and a sweet memory to savior.$$Truly Malaysia with lots of friendly faces, nice local delights and free from war. Malaysia has lots of facinating places which could reduce our stress life in Singapore$$I love to travel to KL and its outskirts.   It offers both new modern shopping centres of mega scales like One Utama or Midvalley to Hypermarkets like Tesco to wholesale like Kenaga etc and yet you can find diversity in old shops in many areas to pasar malam in different vicinity and the open markets like in Jalan Ara.  Simply love the mood when I can go slow or at a fast pace,  the crowd yet you don't find it claustrophobic , the buzz and lively atmosphere you may find at Pavillion dining boulevard close to midnight and above all I felt relaxed each time I am there.  

The main draw for me is the food scene and you are spoilt for choices.  Each time I am there I never fail to make new discoveries and I am so often thrilled by the gem of the new found place and the smacking good food it offers.  

I indulged in the many nice hotels that abounds in KL and I am a frequent customer of Prince Hotel, my favorite accommodation in KL for its image, service, accessibility and proximity to the shopping belts and a short walk away from the midnight movie that I catch at the Pavillion.   

Taxis have been my favorite mode of transportation, so easily available and I always got a wealth of information on places to drink and dine and places of interest.

Truly it's a haven for tourist like me!$$Warm Malaysian Hospitality,authentic local delights,culture and traditions,homestay,indulge in various village pastimes,agro visits delights of rural living$$I love foremost the exotic beaches at Redang, green lushful mountains in Kedah the hilly stations. Shopping in KLCC is awesome and can never be enough. Foods are finger licking and many Halal certified restaurant. Last but not least, Malaysians are friendly by nature and approachable.$$1st & foremost love to go holiday to Malaysia because of the foods that really appeal to my appetite. Stay in their exclusive 5 star hotel & visit their interesting attractions place that sure brings me & family to go holiday to Malaysia. We plan to go holiday to Kelantan to visit my long penpal when I get to know her I was in my teens.$$From the crystal blue waters around the famed island of Sipadan, where divers are surrounded by turtles, schools of jacks and the chance to dive around the only island that is not connected to any continent. To the idyllic island of Langkawi where one can relax under a beach umbrella at Pantai Cenang idling away your time.

Stopping over in Malacca for the foodie lover and moving on to Kuala Lumpur to indulge more in local food and shopping. To burn away all that excess calories, why not opt being 'Tarzan or Jane' for a day and traverse between tree to tree at SkyTrek Adventure Park? If climbing is not your cup of tea, perhaps exploring Mulu caves in Sarawak may bring you back to nature. 

For the adrenaline junkie, Sepang tracks await you and if you do not have a car to speed your way through the tracks, how about Go-karting instead?

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3218366/Life-sea-tribe-Fascinating-pictures-Filipino-islanders-blend-ancient-tradition-modern-world.htmlPhotographer Jacob Maentz spent two weeks with the Calamian Tagbanua sea tribe, capturing the beauty of their customs and shedding light on some of the issues facing them.","I'm sorry if anyone would be offended by this. This is just my personal opinion, and I'm open for enlightenment. I might be missing something.

For me, keeping themselves like that makes them more vulnerable to deceit and maltreatment, which is then consequently detrimental over the areas (natural resources, ancestral land, culture) within their right and responsibility. Making themselves distant over the idea of progress and us encouraging them to keep it that way is a contributing factor over many issues concerning discrimination, land grabbing, over-industrialization, and even environmental harms. My proposal is to instead of encouraging them to keep a tribal nature, let's (the government and the people) make way for them to be part of an educated progress and development so that corporate greed would not swallow them whole. Think about it. I mean, sure, it all sounds well and good but ... what is the significance of ethnic tribes in our modern society? They're not animals, people. They're human beings. We shouldn't encourage them to keep it that way just because they ""look nice"". It's like keeping them in a psychological zoo by telling them it's okay to keep tribal traditions above modern beneficial progress. My point is that we should aim to educate them so that they would be more well-equipped to protect their culture and environment.$$The tribe collect sea cucumbers (pictured) and dry them to be sold on the foreign market, which Maentz found would sell for the equivalent of $83 a kilo.

Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and Sicogon Development Corporation (SIDECO) will launch Sicogon Island Tourism Estate development within the first half of 2016.

The ALI-SIDECO joint venture is expected to drive economic progress in Western Visayas and the entire region as it serves as a tourism hub for surrounding or nearby destinations like Gigantes, Bantayan and Concepcion islands.

The 1,100-hectare Sicogon Island will feature a balanced mix of developments, such as a resort town center, hotels and resorts, as well as commercial and residential establishments, supported by an on-site airstrip.  The ground breaking of the airport runway is scheduled for the second half of the year.

‚ÄúThe initial development will concentrate on building the airport and runway, to ensure accessibility to the island,‚Äù said Jose Emmanuel Jalandoni, ALI Senior vice president and group head of commercial business.  ‚ÄúThe 1.3-kilometer runway will allow immediate access from Manila and Cebu to the island development,‚Äù he added, saying further that test flights to Sicogon are being targeted for the first quarter of 2017.

The project is supported by public, private and community organizations, and government bodies alike because of the potential economic benefits it will bring to the region.  A framework agreement was signed by ALI, SIDECO, and the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk Association (FESIFFA) in 2014 to pave the way for the sustainable development of Sicogon Island.  The group has been assisting the local community through skills training and livelihood programs to make them active partners in the development.

‚ÄúWe strongly believe and hope that poverty alleviation will be achieved through tourism projects.  These will give us various job opportunities and help us improve farming and fishing methods,‚Äù said Raul Ramos, president of FESIFFA.

Jalandoni stressed that sustainability will be a main focus of the project.  Aside from allocating more than 50% of the development for open green space, ALI will also work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to continue stewardship of Sicogon‚Äôs forested area, and work on coastal protection and marine life rehabilitation in support of sustainable development.

‚ÄúMore than becoming a premier tourist destination and a tourism hub for the region, Sicogon is envisioned to provide inclusive growth and economic development through long-term recovery and livelihood programs, and job creation,‚Äù said Jalandoni.

ALI estimates that the Sicogon Island development will provide 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly with increased tourism, and approximately P1 billion in earnings for the community through business opportunities that will come from the retail and commercial establishments.

The 26 meter in height, the clock was built in 1926 during the Dutch colonial as a gift from the Dutch Queen to the city‚Äôs controleur, Rook Maker. It was designed by architects Yazin and Sutan Gigih Ameh. Originally a rooster figure was placed on the apex but it was changed into a Jinja-like ornament during the Japanese invasion. Following the independence of Indonesia, it was reshaped to its present‚Äîresembling traditional Minangkabau roofs which called ‚ÄúRumah Gadang‚Äù.

If you have friends who will travel to Hong Kong Island with a tight budget, please ask them to avoid dorms (9/8/7/6/4/3 bunk bed) that spread on a few floors in an apartment mansion (next to locals, they need to go to work in the morning). You might pay lots of money just to sleep on mattress on the floor (far over-priced and incredibly cramped). Hot water may run out 5 minutes after shower (small electric heater). You also need to pay for towels and flip-flops. The sum you pay may be more than an economy hotel.

By those who know about it, this ten-hectare hidden gem is adored for its supremely fine white sands. But the real adventure begins below the surface ‚Äì with up to 30-meter visibility and an expansive reef, this marine reserve also provides a mystifying dive experience.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Calbayog or Tacloban.                                           Or take a bus from Manila to Tacloban.                                           Or take a boat from Cebu to Calbayog or Ormoc.

Fun Fact: 
The island gets its name from the Cebuano word for bird, possibly owing to the two sandbars that stretch out like wings from its shores.

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what‚Äôs around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to development in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into 
knowing existence.$$Dt 22-01-2016   Hello Friends & Family's   üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥  üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ  üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥   üåûüåûüåû !!!

Boracay, Aklan

How to Get There:
""Fly from Manila to Caticlan.

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan.

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.""

What is it?
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact:
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

Who will take more than 10 rides a day (roughly equalling the value of a day pass) and also given the fact that there are no busses included...am I missing something?
Its so bad, especially for Koreans, that there is no proper daily, weekly or monthly tickets for public transportation in Seoul. Ticket fares seem to be cheap, but it adds up, if you have to commute every day..$$As excited as I am to see Seoul putting effort into doing something good for foreigners, I am inclined to agree with Paul. As someone who doesn't live in Seoul, but likes to go for weekends and holidays, I cannot see myself ever making this pass to be financially efficient. It seems like a LOT of money. If it were up to me, I'd lower the price to 5,000 won a day, and lower the number of possible rides to 10 or 15 a day (not including line transfers, those should not be counted.) I have NEVER known a foreigner to take more then 10 subway trips a day, let alone meet the maximum number of 20.$$Hmm it does seem a little expensive for a day pass - I love the Metro in Seoul - but the best way to see Seoul is walk around its amazing what you miss between stations! 20,000won on a T Money card can  last about a week for me!$$Mufizah- The M-pass allows you to make up to twenty trips in 1 day for 10,000 won, so it is ideal for travelers planning to take a large number of trips on the subway in one day because it gives a savings over the normal rate if you take more than 10 subway rides in a single day. However, it can't be used for buses or in other metropolitian areas, or recharged like a T-money card.$$I love Seoul subway !!!!! Nvr thought it will be easy till I 've tried it out last yr ;)$$That card is way to expensive. Most cities have cards that make up there value with only 3-5 rides. This one takes more than 10 to be worth it. Don't buy if coming to Seoul. $$...So not really a good option unless you plan to spend you day on the subway lol!$$Even then it might be cheaper to take the t-money, just take line nr. 1 all day :)$$Great idea and a huge help for travellers! Is there a similar thing for other cities in Korea?$$Hi Travel Bug! This is just for the Seoul subway.$$i already try it..it's fun & easy too..hehe..luv to try again next time$$I think this is actually a great idea!  This pass if for tourists coming into Seoul, a ride on the train from Incheon to Seoul Station is about 4,000 won one way and then you are forgetting  that base fare is 900 won with a card, and it increases as you travel over distance.  And think about tourists would don't necessarily realize that a destination is much closer walking than taking the subway for one stop?  I know people would rather feel safe knowing that they can take the subway for one stop and exactly know where they are when they exit the subway.

20 rides are day for 10,000 won is quite generous actually, since 10,000 won for Seoulites is only about 8 - 10 rides...$$Hi Ana! It is a day pass costing 10,000 won and is good for up to 20 rides in one day. So, as other people have commented, it saves you money only if you take more than eleven standard 900-won subway rides in one day.$$but 20 rides in a day? is it possible ? to around Seoul in a day ? but if p er ride about 4000 one way...hhmm will think about it :-), i think Beijing subway is more more cheap hehehe$$if i'm not mistaken,this what i've read from the guesthouse website.It takes about 53 minutes from Incheon airport to Seoul Station and the fair is 3,700won(Non-Stop train ; 13,300won)$$This is a great idea.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Thanks for your feedback. These people are representatives from various National Tourism Organizations worldwide, not travel agents.  The program is focused on international exchange and learning from eachother.  

Putting ads in travel magazines is definitely an important part of marketing strategy.  Our company is quite large, and we are mostly focused on online marketing, so I will have to ask around to see what kind of ad campaigns they have in the USA.  What kind of specific aspects of Korea would you like to see featured in such ads?$$I haven't seen a single ad for Korea in any of the travel magazines I've read. As for what kind of ads would appeal to American audiences, different ads focusing on Korea's natural beauty, like its hiking trails and temples (templestay). 
I also think BYJ did a good job with the different tour maps in the back of his book. If he keeps those maps in his English version, that'd be an awesome selling point, too. $$KTO, doing something about Jeju is a most. Is KTO targeting budget travelers who look to spend as little as possible? Or are you targeting women who want to shop? Now that Hawaiian Airlines (very soon) will have direct flights into Korea, you may want to think about what kind of visitor you want?  $$Is there an email address to comment off the wall?  BTW Love yr Facebook Wall.

Until now, it was necessary to perform the tax-free procedure each time for every one store visited. But in the new system, tax-free procedure can be combined with the goods purchased in multiple stores, such as within shopping streets.

Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5, 001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10, 001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district. 

It would be a pleasure to introduce Okayama City as the first shopping spot in Japan where you will have this new Tax-free system benefit.
At the tax-free stores in Omotemachi Shopping Street and Romantic-dori Shopping Street, you may purchase Japanese traditional sweets, tea utensils or Japanese tea, and then operating procedure tax refund at the tax-free counter of Tenmaya department store. You will be able to get the benefit and also you may enjoy authentic Japanese Tea in your home country.

Okayama is absolutely nice place to visit, where you can enjoy not only shopping but other beautiful attractions as well.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/photogenic-mrtOpen your eyes, on your daily commute and you‚Äôll realise our train stations can be pretty cool. Instagram-worthy, even. Check out these 10 stations the next time you take the train!","I especially love Bras Basah MRT Station's glass ceilings. Every time I happen to be there, I always get tricked by the ceilings thinking that it is raining outside.$$I love Choa Chu Kang MRT the most, it's the station that I alight home and also the station that I leave home. Each time people talk about Choa Chu Kang MRT, it makes me feel proud of where I am staying at. Also, each time after returning from camps or overseas and when I alight at Choa Chu Kang MRT, it makes me feel home again. Furthermore, that is also the place where I meet my long-ago friends that I made during my primary and secondary school days, it's like a hot spot that I alight saying ""hi"" and ""bye"" but still feel that ""I'll see you again"".$$Dhoby Ghaut gets my vote due to the beautiful coloured tiles and the amazing 3D effect! Can't wait to refresh my wardrobe with this win!$$I think I will choose Rochor MRT Station. The design of black & white (a never out-dated colours)stripes look cool and unique like filming of the movies star wars.$$Liked and shared! 
My favourite would be Stadium MRT. It is a cool, unique, well designed stadium with splendid scenery around it. It really stands out even when there is no crowds.$$I ‚ù§Ô∏è Stadium MRT because the architect cleverly makes use of natural light to effectively illuminate the station, providing cost effective way to light up the station. 
I also like the slight darker theme which is stark contrast against the ceiling and the tiling... I think it's minimalistic yet elegant üòä
Liked and shared üëç$$it's gotta be bukit panjang LRT for me. not only does it make awesome West makan places such as Al Azhar's so much more accessible, the long panels inside the station itself are a piece of art to look at!$$It's such a hard choice to pick a fav !! I rlly like the unique Kallang wave designs on the floors of stadium !! Rlly brings me the feels of feeling cool and shiok when I take Mrt there for concerts and shoppings!! The view outside the stadium mrt is great too since there is a splendid view of the waters and landscape of Singapore üòòüòçüé°‚öìÔ∏èüåä$$I like Rochor MRT station. Simple, sleek and elegant and a an evergreen feeling just like G2000! Hope to win the vouchers and get myself some G2k clothings! Thank you!

Liked n shared!$$Liked and shared! 

My favourite would be the Stadium MRT. It's full of photos of sports images on the walls And I love the huge station, it looks like I'm inside a ship! The contrast lightings, the sleek grey design is very modern. I often go there to Sports Hub library, and I buy my sports apparel there.

I love G2000 because of the classy, clean and trendy design of the clothes. I love being chic and trendy.$$My favourite is the Stadium! The Jewel tone blue makes me feel at ease and happy! The sleek grey wall outside just nice for people who loves to take selfie or wefie! Cause the plain sleek grey design won snatched away ur presence instead it turns out to be a very nice background ‚ò∫
I love to go G2000 to shop for my bf office wear. It always have nice shirt and pants and it makes my by look smart in them! 
Liked and shared ‚ò∫$$My favourite mrt station has got to be Stadium! The cutting edge design esp the colourful 'runway' makes it look like you are overseas! Very proud of the team who is behind this ; from idea generation to realising it. Thanks for making Singapore a much beautiful place. :)
Liked this post and definitely worth a share in promoting tourism!$$Liked and shared! 

My favourite would be the Stadium MRT. It's full of energy with sporting images at the entrances/exit of the MRT! And I love the colours of the flooring! Furthermore, it's the MRT station I am at everyday! 

On the website, it states to say why you should pick me, and my answer is just simple because I need a wardrobe upgrade for work!$$I like the Dhoby Ghaut series with the pretty glass patterned window panels! It just makes every outfit look awesome with the natural lighting! 

Very nice series of OOTD! I need to shop at G2000!!

Meghan Tan Krathlyn Yu Yvonne Chong$$Liked and shared! Love the bras brasah station ceiling which allows natural light to get in! And of course the super long escalator (such that it can feel like an amusement roller coaster ride for the faint hearted! * grab the railings! Don't turn back! * )$$I love Redhill station the most, it is not a new station and its design is not as nice as the rest of the mrt stations but it brought back many childhood memories as I used to stay there with my dearest grandfather! He is not around anymore but whenever I pass by this station, it will remind me of the fond memories I had with him!

Thanks thesmartlocal and G2000 for this  giveaway!$$Bras basah mrt has got to be the favorite for me with its unique and mesmerizing architectural design. Plus the super high see through ceiling that gives the natural lighting and zen colour codes of the mrt walls makes it ideal for having ootd in G2000 winter wear!$$Liked and shared! 
I love the stadium shot, as the grey walls gives the calm feel, and the blue waves in the station gives the futuristic feel. 
I would often hang around kallang wave, and this is also the reason why i love stadium mrt!!:)$$My favorite among all the photogenic mrt stations will be üöá Dhoby Ghaut Station!

Born a west-sider, I've always like to make extra effort to doll myself up going the distance away especially town areas. Apart from that, the station is underground and air-conditioned, which would allow me to dress in any type of outfit and no sweat! üí¶ G2000 have wide range of really nice and comfortable formal outfits best suited for working class (like ME!) and I love taking varieties of OOTDs anywhere that I can find in public. Now IT's Time For MRT... Doors closing, dududududu.....$$Liked and shared! My favourite mrt station would be Rochor because simplicity is key! White and black colour scheme never grow old and it looks so unique and stand out most among all the mrt station in Singapore! Furthermore its on downtown line which is my favourite line and I am quite sure alot Westies rely heavily after its launch last year!$$Love all the pics esp for Dhoby Ghaut station! Liked n shared! 

My answer for why should you pick me... I need more work clothes! & I love the clothes @ G2000! Hope to win! ‚ò∫Ô∏è$$i liked Redhill mrt based photos. its red in color. its got ""age"" in the photo. Bring back fond memories with the payphone booth. At the wall base, you can see some aging and some wear and tear. I reflects that we need to look after our past to look into the future!$$Liked the 2 FB. Liked and shared the post. I didn't know that there are ""primary colour stations "" along the East-West line. I will go explore the west -- just make pit stops at these stations to take pictures with one MRT ticket - station after station!  Different colour, even simple plain colour could just set the different mood and feel - so this is my Favourite of the lots, esp the cheerful yellow at Commonwealth station.  
üíõ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüíö$$6. Commonwealth.

I grew up there, its a station that holds so many memories! From going to malls, schools and even town, its so accessible and convenient! The colours still remain which brings out the many years of untouched history unlike new stations that are too colourful. üçÄ$$My favourite is Stadium MRT Station. The station interiors are lit up by natural light from a large opening in the roof. Aluminium cladding adds luminosity for a ‚Äúsoft-touch‚Äù look. Stadium MRT Station really stands out among other train stations with its good design and innovation.

Not proud, but I barely passed basic Chinese at O levels and even once scored zero on an exam (lol). So embarrassing but it has much to do with the fact that my entire family isn't very good with mandarin. Including my grandparents who were English educated back then hahahaha

But thanks to channel 8, I picked up mandarin here and there and as I grew up, I learnt but it's not as good.

I've been living in Singapore on and off for about 9 years, without knowing any or very little mandarin - but I know the important stuff like saying yes when the Uncle asks if I want Chilli in my wanton Mee üåù. What's worse is that I always get mistaken to be Chinese and older generations have even scolded me for my lack of linguistic abilities. üòî

I'd love for the opportunity to explore China with my Boyfriend Lam Weng Pui who is also as bad in the language front having done CLB in O levels and spending very little time in Singapore.$$#mychinesedamnbad
I'm Eurasian, my husband Isaac Abraham is Indian. We both can't speak anything besides English. And our 4.5yr old has been tasked to study Mandarin in school.

My first digital camera was from SONY- I definitely share an affinity with and trust this brand!üòÅ$$Listing only one key function of SONY's Cyber-shot‚Ñ¢ DSC-RX100M4 doesn't do justice to this pocket size friendly camera! Known for its superspeed potential, it's packed with impressive features like an F1.8-2.8 aperture, a ZEISS¬Æ Vario-Sonnar T* 24-70mm lens, and shutter speeds of up to 1/32,000 of a second, it takes DSLR quality pictures without the bulk!

RX100M4 has a F1.8-2.8 lens which make my photo Bokeh-licious (creating a very shallow depth of field), also the high ISO allow me to take supreme night shot with low noise. The high shutter speed of 1/32000sec allows me to capture sharp images when performing high speed photography. I believe this camera will help me in photography as I am love bokeh photography and night shot.$$The low aperture available with the Cybershot DSC-RX100M4 will allow me to take amazing pictures of food that has different layers, which happens that most of them are my favourites; think bingsoo, pancakes, cakes and waffles. Yay for desserts, will the cybershot camera, I can nail these with a great depth of field behind the food photograph. Cheers to instaworthy food pics. Thanks the smart local üôåüèª$$SONY's Cyber-shot‚Ñ¢ DSC-RX100M4 has so many impressive features and i especially love the shutter speeds of up to 1/32,000 of a second, perfect for capturing high quality pictures even when moving around! This camera is light and compact enough that i can easily bring it with me on my backpacking trips. :)$$As a hipster cafes lover, I've encounter some difficulties in taking nice food pictures especially lighting issues. With DSC-RX100M4, I'm more ready to upload into Instagram since the one-inch sensor in the lightweight and nifty camera is good for snapping photos in low light environment. And also, the weight and photo quality blew my mind. What's more could i ask.

The wifi sharing functions is useful for cafes lovers because I'm able to share all the on the table projects/Flat lay photos on social media such as Instagram.$$Liked and shared! I love compact the slim SONY's Cyber-shot‚Ñ¢ DSC-RX100M4 is. That not only makes it easy and convenient to carry around for daily uses and at the same time we don‚Äôt have to compromise on the quality of the shots taken unlike other compact cameras. DSLR quality photos can be easily produced with this camera, just how great is that? Another favourite would be the 180 degree tilting LCD screen with that, there‚Äôll never be blurry & pixelated selfies! Yay. Love how Sony manages to squeeze such amazing features and functions into such a small frame. :) Jian Sheng TheSmartLocal.com Sony Mobile SG Sony Mobile$$Liked and shared‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è I've always faced difficulties in taking nice food pictures because of lighting issues and now I no longer enjoy taking pictures of food bec all the pictures just don't turn out nice. However, the one-inch sensor in the light and nifty camera is the best for capturing photos in low light, helping me to combat dimly-lit restaurants or cafes. Such a compact and light camera sounds like my best pal, simply just pop it into my bag and I'm ready to head out with my girlfriends. The wifi is definitely something to look out for because I'll then be able to share pictures on social media with my friends almost instantaneously‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I've been looking out for a compact and light camera without compromising all the features and I've seemed to found the perfect one! Hope to win this so that I can this new toy outfit some fun üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíï$$I love its wireless capability and  compact size! I'm personally not a professional photographer, but I definitely love snapping candid photos on the go! (these are the best photos, aren't they!! üòÅ) The high shutter speed is thus really handy for a noob like me! ü§ó Woohoo!$$I love its 1 inch sensor which will help me capture much better quality photograph at night than using a mobole phone as i absolutely like to take photographs of the countless scenic view in the night. Furthermore, these 1-inch sensor that aids the high speed photography will definitely help me in sports photography which is also one of my greatest interest$$To be plain honest, having this compact Cyber-shot RX100M4 will become my ""bring-around"" camera. Personally as a film maker, i like to rubberneck at people's life, but it's impossible to bring my big DSLR or cameras around. This camera could help capture moments and also assist my ""photographic mind"".$$It is an excellent choice especially during travelling and hiking. The weight and video/photo quality just crushes and blow the competition out of the water! You cannot find any other camera with such ridiculous nice shots for this size.

The video and photo quality at this size is just insanely good. It is comparable to dslr but at such a small size that fits conveniently into your pocket. 

The wifi sharing functions is excellent for sharing your media content as soon as you take them and share it with your friends online on your social media such as instagram, facebook and youtube.$$Liked and shared the post! I love the fact that the camera will be able to take good photos in low light as this is definitely something I know my phone (yup I can't do without my phone's camera but there's only so much it can do at night haha) can't achieve! I would love to take photos that captures the mood and lighting at that time so it can recreate the ambience just by looking at the photo! Plus it's so compact, I can bring it around without having too lug a big bag around! :)

Really hope to win this for my sister as she has been longing for a camera for her upcoming exchange programme! Can't wait for her to share her amazing photos with us while we are stuck here in sunny sg! Talk abt the convenience of the wifi function üòâ$$The sleek body enable me to carry out in my bag and the camera act like a DSLR. With the feature of capturing better quality picture in low light setting, this definitely help in capturing nicer picture in a low light setting restaurants or environment. Then I can upload my picture immediately to instagram with the in-built wifi!$$The ability of this pocket-friendly and sleek camera to capture quality photos in even low light is extremely appealing! Moreover, this seems highly convenient to carry around for people who are always on-the-go and would like to do so without the extra weight of a conventional DSLR. :)$$Liked and Shared! If you ask me what my favourite function of the SONY Cyber-shot Camera, it would definitely be the Super High Speed function in which I can take perfect candid photos of people around me. I love taking candid photos of people as these photos are usually the ones which show the real emotions of people at that moment. With this function I would definitely be able to take super clear and photos of high quality!$$SONY's Cyber-shot‚Ñ¢ DSC-RX100M4 is a powerful compact camera which is super convenient for me to carry around during my mandatory weekend adventure. Extremely suitable for Instagram addicts like me!

One of my favorite function would probably be the Aperture. With Aperture as low as f1.8, I'll be able to achieve sharp and define bokeh photos!

MOST IMPORTANTLY..... All its incredible features made it suitable for all occasions, anytime and anywhere! Say no to all ugly and blurry photos and welcome a new generation of clear and sharp photography! ALL HAIL SONY!$$Love the compact size of this camera which doesnt compromise on its photo quality! The size makes it so convenient and is a camera which i wont be too lazy to bring out as compared to those bulky dslrs.$$I have never own a professional camera before so actually all the functions from SONY Cyber-shot are what I need to be able to snap my memories and help me to fulfill my dream of starting up my own YouTube channel! ‚ò∫Ô∏è$$Liked and shared! Love that the camera is handy, and able to capture photos sharp and clear. It really matters when taking photos of food, every detail matters! üòä$$The 180-degree tilting LCD screen would allow me to take photos of a subject from a variety of angles, which makes it more interesting! The one-inch sensor means better photo in low-light condition. :)$$The in-built wifi for sure... What's the point of Instagram if I'm going to have to go home, transfer from the SD card when the moment's over? It's going to be great also for me to shoot my two furry kids with bokeh, giving it that dreamy look~~~$$Liked and shared !!

Tan Ceci Elisa Lee Qi Ng Xuan Nana Lee Ken Ong Ren Jie Chen Richard Tay$$My hubby Edwin Wang watched the preview and enjoyed it. Exciting and thrilling. It will be great to win some merchandise for good memory as afterall is Jack Hughman's last presence as Wolverine.$$As the final chapter for Wolverine's adventures on the big screen or at least for Hugh Jackman, its a definite must see and with such amazing merchandise such as the replica claw, its a great way to remember this final chapter! Thats why I hope to win it, especially the claw! Lets go watch it, Jade Chew$$Because MY TIME HAS COME to win this Bail Eys Low$$i love wolverine and do you know that Wolverine is a man of many names. His birth name is James Howlett. He's commonly known as Logan. To some, he is known as ""Weapon X"". 

I already own the wolverine claw that was used in the movie (the wolverine), and i would love to also win this replicate claw so i can add it to my wolverine collection. Currently i am living with my parents and waiting for HDB to give me my own place.

When i get it, i am going to build a wolverine display so this claw would be displayed nicely in it.

I will be watching it with my wife Shonna Seow :) (pic of my claw)$$I read X-men comics since I was a little boy and I never got tired of it as new mutants keep popping out with their new special mutant ability and I believe that mutants really exists amongst us at that time. However, I'm an adult now and I know mutants exists only in another universe, the cinematic universe that is. However, that does not stop me from admiring Wolverine Aka Logan for his sense of justice and his determination to stand up for the right cause and to defend the weak. He is my idol and I wish to have the Replica claw as a symbol of justice and righteousness and to remind me to be a good person!
Let's watch Logan Jasmine Ong
Liked and shared too!$$I wanna win this Replica claw so badly! I had joined many contests that gave out the replica claws in the past few wolverine or X-men movies but without success. This Replica Claw from Logan might not be the last one as X-men movies will likely carry on for another few decades but it will be the last chance for me to own a replica claw that is used by wolverine played by Hugh Jackman. I wish to own one of the Replica Claw as a tribute to Hugh Jackman aka Wolverine and to remember him for playing the role  my favourite mutant all these years! I would like to watch Logan with Sit Ting Wen as this will be the final time Hugh Jackman will act as Wolverine!
liked and shared too!$$I want to win this giveaway because its very sad that this is Hugh Jackman's last movie for wolverine, so I hope to win this as my consolation prize to cheer me up a little and keep this as a memory that he is the best actor for Wolverine! <3 Gonna see with Julin Chua hehehe$$Hoping to win as I love all things X-Men and of all the characters, I always have a soft spot for Wolverine as he is the coolest and most loyal of all the mutants!! Keeping my fingers crossed!!! Liked and shared with Evelyn Tan$$have seen all the reviews for LOGAN and they've all been amazing (not surprised). truly can't wait to watch Hugh Jackman's final portrayal of Wolverine, it's the end of a great era and winning this (especially the t-shirt!) would make this film even more memorable for me :-)$$I want to win this giveaway as this is the last time that Hugh Jackman will be appearing on screen as Wolverine, so I want to have something to remember that this phenomenal actor once acted in such a great role. 

I will frame up the memento if it's the claws and wear it if it's the T-shirt! Hopefully it's the claws!

Would love to watch this with Theng Siong!$$I have been collecting wolverine items for years and I need this in my collection!

This will make our entertainment room look outstanding! üòçüòç Love wolverine! Love X-men! Mike Lin and I will definitely be catching LOGAN! #HisTimeHasCome$$I liked Wolverine movies and XMen. Hugh Jackman would have agree too!! It is sad to see  this great character portray by Hugh Jackman to be his last of XMen Series. I hope to have his Replica Claw for souniver and make an enrage X claw pose. Alex Chew Wei Xiong$$Love xmen since childhood . Most of all my Favourite hero is wolverine ! Love his self healing abilities and not to mention his sharp razor claws ! 

Collecting its figurines, posters and collectables is my daily life routine. Never ever miss out the movies of xmen since it's debut.

What's more now I have the chance to own the exclusive claw which is like a once in a life time opportunity for me.

Amalus Barakna$$I want to win the Replica claw because it looks so cool and shiny! Logan is my favourite mutant as being a woman , I loved cooking and hence I dig knifes.

The island is famous for its virgin beaches and secret swimming spots. But the thing about Siquijor that probably resonates the most is its reputation for magic and sorcery.

Fun Fact:
Local healers can concoct potions made from oils and herbs for visitors to take home. A scented lana (coconut oil-based ointment) made by a healer is believed to relieve one of stomach aches and body pains.

Fun Fact:
People from Batanes are called Ivatans. Scholars are unable to trace their origins, but evidence suggests that they came from northern Luzon and Taiwan. Ivatans live in sturdy stone houses made of limestone to protect them from harsh weather.

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Zambales from Caloocan or Cubao (seven hours).

What is it?
In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

""I saw your recent post regarding future Singapore MRT/LRT maps and thought I‚Äôd throw mine into the ring. The Singapore MRT has long been one of my fave metro systems around the world. 

I like the concept of destination numbers and station numbers - I believe it is one of the first, if not the first, to use this concept (do let me know if that‚Äôs not quite right).  

My approach for this map is to incorporate the station number into the station marker itself to avoid some of the clutter associated placing the station name AND the number alongside the station marker.  

Also, I really wanted the Circle Line to be a circle, so I have adopted a few distortions to make that happen. Finally, I tried to incorporate geography of Singapore in a stylistic manner to further reinforce the circle motif.

The oldest existing city in the Indian peninsula and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Madurai is richly steeped in cultural heritage. The city, earlier known as Madhurapuri, grew around a huge temple built by Pandian King Kulasekhara 2,500 years ago. 

Madurai became famous during the Sangam period through the third and last conglomeration of Tamil scholars, which existed for more than 100 years. The city was the magnificent capital of Pandya kings and visited by travellers such as Megasthenes (302 BC), Pliny (77 AD), Ptolemy (140 AD), Marco Polo (1203 AD) and Ibu Batuta (1333 AD). Today, Madurai is synonymous with the awe-inspiring Meenakshi-Sundareswarar Temple

The Holy Mass is not for entertainment; it is for the glorification of God and for the sanctification of the Faithful. There is a proper time and place for everything; the Mass should be reserved for worship, not for unliturgical acts and greetings. Lastly, most of us are Roman Catholics, hence, we follow the Roman Rite. The Roman style of worship is rigid, concise, and solemn in nature. Clerics should not innovate and personalise the rituals in the Holy Mass. If it is not written in the rubrics and in liturgical documents, it should not be done. -- It's a blessing that the priest accepted his mistake.

For non-divers ‚Äì the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

Why? Because the pronunciation of Owl in Japanese, ‚ÄúFukuro‚Äù almost the same as Ike‚Äúbukuro‚Äù.

Guyam is a small deserted island of the coast of Siargao near General Luna. The island is visited daily by visitors on a boattrip or who come to just chill out for a while. It's a perfect little island with no facilities exept a toilet and 2 shelters. For a small fee the owner will allow people to stay on the island overnight. I've been in Siargao for over 2 months, the vibe of the island and the beauty of the surrounding islands make Siargao and incredible and addicting island. For a while have I been planning the right time to visit this island during the time when the milky way would be visible √°nd when there would be no light pollution of the moon, also trying to lucky with clear weather. 

The milky is not visible like this with your own eyes, it is because of long exposure shots (20 seconds) that details of the milky way become visible and with postprocessing details and contrast are further enhanced. The settings used are ISO 1600, f2.8, shutterspeed of 20seconds. I used a D800 and 14-24mm lens, but any DSLR can capture this and even a good compact camera with RAW abilities.

""...Every country has unique things to offer, but the Philippines is, by far, my favorite. I've never met a kinder group of people and a more beautiful landscape. The blues of waters, the most exaggerated landscapes, there is just so much to do!

""My time in the Philippines was unforgettable and i loved it so much that i'll actually be going back in 2016.""

Check out his HONEST review of his visit to some of the Philippines' top destinations, including Bohol, Cebu, Palawan, and Siquijor, through this Vlog and we hope you too get to experience how MORE FUN it is in the Philippines!

P.S. Just some minor corrections and suggestions:

(1) On the duration of tourist visa:
a foreign traveller can actually stay in the Philippines visa-free for 30 days and not 21 days, as stated in the video.

(2) The whole of Mindanao is not unsafe and there are equally beautiful touristic destinations one could visit in there such as Siargao, which is becoming a world surf haven; Cagayan de Oro, known for the wild river rafting; Davao, where the Philippines' highest peak, Mt. Apo, could be trekked; Camiguin, where you could swim in a carbonated water, and many more! :-)

I noticed that in your caption you have highlighted ""Corrections""... I think it would be great if you included in this that Mindanao as a whole isn't unsafe, and that many areas in Northern Mindanao can happily be explored and experienced as any other areas in the country.  

For example:

Camiguin is technically part of Mindanao... Cagayan de Oro where I live is part of Mindanao... Siargao (one of the biggest backpacking islands) is part of Mindanao. 

It would be great if you ""stuck up for Mindanao"" in your caption as well.

Singlish version: Singlish best dun believe watch this video la.

SEE WHAT I MEAN!!

Also read: http://thesmartlocal.com/read/food-trends ","That chope move!! #winliaolor XDD$$This is a long post but just wanted to let some of my fellow Singlishers know. (This was in response to someone's comment about Singlish being inferior to English).

Singlish is a totally separate language system from English. It is neither an ""accented"" English, ""lazy/broken"" English, nor a ""dialect"".

A language system is not only defined by its vocabulary but also its pragmatics and universal grammaticular and audinal rules, which Singlish satisfies.

If you don't believe what I'm saying, I recommend you to read up some thesis publications especially in ""Language and Development"" regarding the establishment of Singlish as an entire new language system, which has since gained steam post 2008s as the progress and knowledge of human language development blossomed. Some of these were written and taught by multiple professors when I was in NUS, and they (foreign lecturers) were behind the stand that Singlish was innately a language, not a dialect.

Having established this, it is only natural if a foreigner is unable to understand us whilst in Singapore, the same way I wouldn't understand Tagalog if I were in Philippines or any other country, simply because it is another LANGUAGE, not a corruption of English.

I truly feel that Singaporeans need to take ownership of our beloved native language and enjoy its usage to the maximum. Do not be ashamed of it and do not let anyone make you feel that Singlish is inferior to English because it is not.

Cheers to all the Singlish speakers out there.$$Not bad but not a very accurate representation. The guy is just lo sor, nothing to do with singlish v english$$Still don sound natural leh.... espiacially wen ordering mcdonald.

This relaxation escapade by Jojo Struys over a 2 day itinerary from 26 to 27 November 2016, certainly is a super relaxation staycation that I need to explore on the bustling central that I cannot imagine the hidden gem that allows me to be totally carefree. 
Having high rise buildings around had not deterred what I hope to get from the stay in The Westin. 
Having to face the lovely scene of Marina Bays while engaging in a yoga session at infinity pool simply is a real luxury that takes my breath away. 
Indulgence of the SuperFoodsRx is something that I hope to be able to eat healthily and heartier for my tummy. 
Enjoying the jacuzzi and steambath certainly leads me to an enchanted space out that I hope to enjoy. 
What's the best part a cozy snuggle on the 10 layers of comfortable SIMMONS bed is what I call maximum pampered. 
Breakfast at seasonal tastes is making me missing the comfort to patronise again for my next escapade.

There are some people who couldn‚Äôt understand why others spend on local hotel stays instead of getting out of Singapore for a holiday and enjoy the fresher air somewhere else. For me, a Singapore staycation is a good recharge when I couldn‚Äôt afford to take leave to travel/didn‚Äôt feel up to it. Being in Singapore elsewhere other at home can sometimes be quite a therapy! I can be momentarily be relieved from all stress, work and at the same time ‚Äúfantasize‚Äù about having my own house.

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn‚Äôt a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 ‚Äî known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It‚Äôs only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They‚Äôve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

The former Braddell-Westlake Secondary School has been abandoned since 2005, and as with abandoned places, eerie vibes here are at an all-time high.  The amazing thing about this place? Unlike most abandoned places, the gates here are opened with the disclaimer ""Enter at your own risk"" instead of ""Trespassers will be prosecuted."" Yay!

Graffitied walls, shattered windows and dusty floors are a dead giveaway on this place‚Äôs inhabitants. Or lack thereof. One more desolated location to check off your photography bucket list!

Directions: Take a train to Braddell MRT, then walk towards blk 209 and follow the sheltered walkway.

I would love to see more pictures  and the history of Philippines.$$When I think of the Philippines pre WWII, I always envision it in sepia or b&w... dark, oppressed, indigent, depressed... because that's how photos from those days look like today and that's how they are also depicted on film. But I have always thought if colors were of importance during that time... was it a luxury that only the affluent can afford for their garments? ES Sison's work gave me a different perspective on history through colorizing. It does not only show how people in the past might have actually looked like but it also unravels the emotions within... You can actually feel the connection as a Filipino the moment you stare at their hued faces.
