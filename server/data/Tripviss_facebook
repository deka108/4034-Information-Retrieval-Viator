Maya bay is a wonderful bay surrounded by 100-meter high sheer cliffs. By being almost separated from the sea, it looks pretty much like a huge natural swimming pool that almost gives a feeling of privacy. The bay is made up three beaches in the bay, two tiny ones and the main beach, a 200m long stretch of white powdery sand and exceptionally clear water. It is where the movie ""The Beach"" was filmed.

Olu Deniz, a beautiful inland bay that stretches behind the cape, is now closed to yachts. The reason this heavenly place is called Olu deniz (""Sea of the Dead"") is attributed to the following legend;

Once a father and son were caught in a storm here and were in danger of sinking. The son claimed that if they approached the rocks ashore they could take shelter in a cove. The father on the other hand asserted that their ship would be driven onto the rocks and break up and that there were no coves around here anyway. In his terror of running around on the rocks, the father knocked his son (who was at the helm) into the sea with an oar and took over the helm himself. Just as the ship was about to hit the rocks on the cape, she turned into this calm, smooth watered bay. 

This is the reason they say the bay is called the Sea of the Dead, whereas what with the pine clad sandy beach stretched out like a tongue, the name ""Paradise Bay"" would be more fitting.

The Blue Lagoon of Olu deniz has calm, crytal clear waters which makes it ideal for a variety of water sports and a very safe place for children to swim. Part of the lagoon is now a protected area (and it`s a national park).

This Chiang Mai baby elephant has a habit of tumbling into helpless tourists and demanding to be snuggled.

A series of cuddling videos featuring little elephant “Nampuu” (or “Fountain”) were posted on Instagram by happy visitors who encountered the playful baby boy in the past month.

Nampuu lives at Patara Elephant Farm in Chiang Mai and is the star attraction of the “Elephant Owner for a Day” package tour designed to let people learn how to take care of elephants. On the tour, they learn about elephant temperament, health, bathing and how to communicate with the pachyderms.
