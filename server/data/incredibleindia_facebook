The Simhastha Kumbh is an unrivalled celebration in India. The most popular legend regarding the origin of Kumbh Melas is the Samudra Manthan or 'churning of the ocean'. Gods and demons competed ¬ercely in the churning in search of the divine nectar of immortality. During this epic battle to capture the Urn (Kumbh) containing the nectar, drops of the precious liquid fell on four places – Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Nashik and Ujjain. Hence, river Kshipra became the enhancer of life and to celebrate this event since then the grand festival came in vogue. Kumbh Mela, is held once every twelve years at these four places and attracts millions of devotees.

Grand Simhastha, on the Ghats of the glorious Kshipra

The Ujjain Kumbh is celebrated when Jupiter ascends into sun sign Leo's quarter or the Simha constellation of zodiac, which is why it is called 'Simhastha'. The Simhastha is special in Ujjain as it is the seat of divine Mahakal - the Lord of all times. The ritual of bathing in the holy waters of Kshipra begins on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (March-April) and continues on various dates until the full moon shows up in the following month of Vaishakha.

Simhastha 2016 will begin on 22nd of April and will continue till 21st of May.

Sadhus of various sects from across the country assemble in Ujjain and mingle with ordinary people as they take their ritual dip in the holy waters of the Kshipra.!

Inextricably linked with the history of Sikhism, Amritsar is amongst the most revered sites of the world. It was founded as recently as the 16th century. Its name is a derivative of the Amrit Sarovar (pool of nectar) amidst which stands the Golden Temple, the most sacred of Sikh shrines. Accounts suggest that Guru Amardas purchased the land from Emperor Akbar and decided to build a tank at the site. Following his death, it was completed by Guru Ramdas and also came to be known as Chak Ramdas or Guru ka Chak. Some of the oldest markets in Amritsar, notably Guru ka Bazaar, date back to his time. The construction of the Golden Temple was initiated by Guru Arjan Dev while Guru Hargobind, who accorded the religion a martial temper, built the Akal Takht in 1606. Amritsar has a rich history encompassing various mythical and historical narratives including the epic Ramayana. It is believed that the site called Ram Tirath was Maharish Valmiki’s ashram, where Sita reportedly gave birth to her twin sons, Luv and Kush. The Gobindgarh Fort and Ram Bagh were built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire. While the Jallianwala Bagh continues to be the most evocative monument to India’s freedom struggle. The Khalsa College, established by visionary leaders at the beginning of the 20th century turned Amritsar into a hub of education. Also a centre of thriving industry since its inception, Amritsar is famed for its textiles, particularly shawls, and for its carpets. Amritsar has gained tremendous popularity for its gourmet traditions; especially the dhabas (roadside eatery) that churn out, amongst an inexhaustible list of delicacies, irresistible kulchas, chola-bhaturas, tandoori chicken and fried fish. Amritsar has all the makings of a well-rounded tourist destination; its ancient legends, historical monuments, places of worship, old bazaars, theatre traditions and colourful festivals all serve as a window to its robust past. Excursions to the Harike Bird Sanctuary and visits to the India-Pakistan border at Wagah are an absolute delight, while breaking bread or celebrating Diwali with the denizens of this hospitable city is without parallel.(Courtesy Punjab Tourism)",https://www.facebook.com/incredibleindia/photos/a.305148219500600.97654.144113158937441/1274948545853891/?type=3,,https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1452246_1274948545853891_2744264983483087020_n.jpg?oh=779535d363fc052f4d9a3b21700a936b&oe=59699551,,https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1452246_1274948545853891_2744264983483087020_n.jpg?oh=3dae1bac27ec46438585834b50ae1e42&oe=5970E2AE,,192,24,198,13,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwoKgR0ZwMI$$Just for my friends living in India:

Kalimpong has for long been in the shadows of its better known big brother – Darjeeling. Situated between the Deolo and Durbindra Hills at the foot of the mighty Himalayas, the landscape of this famous hill station in the state of West Bengal is a feast for one's eyes. 

51 km east of Darjeeling and at an altitude of 1250 metres, Kalimpong is a blaze of colour throughout the year thanks to the richness of its breathtaking flora. Apart from being a place to head to escape the heat of the plains, Kalimpong is the reminiscent of an English town, with faded, elegant buildings evocative of another era.

Life, in every form and mood, has been captured in stone, testifying not only to the craftsman's artistry but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose rule the temples were conceived and constructed. The Khajuraho temples were built in the short span of a hundred years, from 950-1050 AD in truly inspired burst of creativity. Of the 85 original temples, 22 have survived till today to constitute one of the world's great artistic wonders.

The Bandhavgarh National Park, lying in the heart of the Vindhya Mountain Range in Central India, is a small and compact National Park, yet full of game. The density of the tiger population at Bandhavgarh is the highest known in India. 
The centre of the park is dominated by the majestic Bandhavgarh Fort built in the 14th century, around which are numerous caves containing shrines and ancient Sanskrit inscriptions. The park has four main entrances, Panpatha in the north, Tala in the east (most of the hotels are located in Tala), Dhamokar in the south-west and Khitauli in the west. Two roads, Umaria-Rewa highway and Parasi-Katni road via Khitauli pass through the park. Tala is a small village on the Umaria-Rewa state highway. 

The Original home of all the white tigers alive, today, Bandhavgarh was the hunting ground of the Maharajas of Rewa; their old fort still dominates a hill in the forest. These white tigers were found in the old state of Rewa for many years. The last known tiger was captured by Maharaja Martand Singh in 1951. The White Tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharaja of Rewa.

The easternmost hill district of Uttarakhand, Pithoragarh and its surroundings are known for their abundant natural beauty. Nestling in a small valley, barely 5 km long and 2 km wide, the town was an important landmark during the reign of the Chand Rajas of Kumaon. 

Pithoragarh is the district headquarters and its government buildings are housed in the hill fort of Pithoragarh at a distance of 7 km from the main town. From the Chandak hill located here, one gets a panoramic view of snowy ranges extending from the Trishul-Nanda Devi, Panchchuli Group to Mount Appi of Nepal.

Sanchi’s stupas, monasteries, temples and pillars dating from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The most famous of these monuments, Stupa 1, known as the Great Stupa, was originally built by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, the then governor of Ujjayini, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant from the adjacent town of Vidisha. Their son Mahindra and daughter Sanghamitra were born in Ujjayini and sent to Sri Lanka, where they converted to king, the queen and their people to Buddhism.

The Sanchi hill goes up in shelves with Stupa 2 situated on a lower shelf, Stupa 1, Stupa 3, the 5th century Gupta Temple No.17 and the 7th century temple No. 18 are on the intermediate shelf and a later monastery is on the crowning shelf. The balustrade surrounding Stupa 2, carved with aniconic representations of the Buddha, was added in the late 2nd century BC under the Satavahanas.

The adjacent Gupta temple no.17 was hailed by Sir John Marshall as one of the most rationally organized structures in Indian architecture. Though small, it was a herald of all the principles which went into the engineering of an Indian temple in the early medieval period. The Buddhas in the perambulatory surrounding Stupa 1 are not contemporary with the Stupa but belong to the Gupta period in the mid-5th century AD. The monastery and the temple with the tall pillars adjacent to Stupa 1 and the temple near the monastery on the crowning shelf illustrate the evolution of the architectural form after the 5th century Gupta temple.

We stay at Kolkata. My son works in Bangalore. We went to Bangalore for two weeks. So, we hoped that we would enjoy a quite stay for two nights in this place, as it was very close to Bangalore, only 60 kms away. 
Nandi Hills is about 4500 ft high. Hotel Pine Top is situated in a beautiful place on the hill top in an isolated place. We reached the hotel at about 17 hrs in the dusk of 26.06.2015, by climbing a serpentine hilly road and became exited to enjoy the coming nights. 
When we arrived at the reception desk of Hotel Pine Top, we found that there were some hotel personnel seated near the entrance and some guests were enjoying evening tea and snacks in adjacent dining room. On the way, we also noticed a lot of parked cars, as it was Friday, the beginning of a weekend. 
We informed the hotel personnel that we had room bookings. They advised us to wait, but none came forward. After a while, one person moved to us. We told him that we had prior booking and showed him the reservation voucher. He called another person, who took our luggage, guided us to downstairs and opened two rooms. Rooms were two stories below the reception and one would have to climb down by the stairs by the side of the building. It was drizzling and the sky was extremely cloudy.
The rooms were glass-fitted with open front view of the valley. The view was really superb. There were steps to go down to a garden. From there, vast valley was being seen. The place was really calm and quite. There was a half-circle view-point in the complex, in the same level of reception, from where the view was more wide open.
But we could not stay. When we reached the reception, we found that everyone was disliking our presence. No one greeted us, as if we were non-invitees. No one was coming forward to speak with us. The person, who moved to us informed that there was no room available. No welcome message. Later we found that there was no other boarder beside us. When we informed that we had prior reservation, he told with a stoned face that there was shortage of water and electricity, as it was a hilly area. Might be. Then came the next point. We would have to take dinner within 7 PM, as there would no electricity after 7 PM. Water would be not available after 7 PM, 
We, however, accepted the proposal as we had nothing to do and nowhere to go. But, when the rooms were opened for us, no electricity was present in the rooms. Then we found no water in the tap in the bathrooms with lots of cockroaches in the rooms and bathrooms. Rooms were not clean and linens were not fresh and at some places dirty. It was becoming dark and we were horrified to find that big rats were moving freely inside the rooms and bathrooms. Street dogs were freely circling in the corridor and garden. We also came to know that mobile network would not work there. We were puzzled to think what to do in that evening. However, we decided not to stay in that horrible place. There was also no telephone connection between the rooms and the reception upstairs. So, at night, if there would be any emergency, we would find our way through rodents and dogs to go to reception upstairs, might be no one would be available there. After a good thought, we did not take any risk to stay there. Luckily, Bangalore was not far away.
We came back to the reception with our luggage and asked for the complaint book. When we told the hotel personnel that we would not stay, none asked us the reason, as if it was a better decision. We also noticed that in the complaint register, there were similar complaints by the previous boarders/customers, but KSTDC took no step. We wrote our grievances in the complaint register, but till date, no official from KSTDC/Karnataka Government telephoned us or made any query. We understood that though we noticed a lot of cars, all those people would return back to Bangalore in the evening and none would stay there at night. But we came from Kolkata,a far away place, to enjoy and were cheated. Probably, KSTDC/Karnataka Government does not have time to bother in such petty matter.
On our way back to Bangalore, we found other nearby hotels/resorts/lodges with electricity arrangements. We toured to other hilly remote places, even in high altitude, where supply of power were arranged at least upto 9/10 pm. Nandi Hills is a very good place for 1-2 nights stay, as it is very near to Bangalore. We could not understand why Karnataka Government was not developing the place. The hotel is beautifully placed, rooms are not bad, a big restaurant is attached, approachable road is there and lots of tourists come to this place. Only some developments, like electricity, water and mobile tower, are to be made. Then many other hoteliers will be interested to come to this place and the place will turn into a hot tourist spot. It is a good business opportunity for the local Government and also an avenue for development of local people. Instead of improving the place, KSTDC is charging higher for the weekends. The tariff of a double-bedded room was Rs.1150 in normal weekdays, whereas in the weekend it would jump to Rs.1500, which we had to pay in full. We felt very sorry that we could not enjoy this beautiful place. State Government is turning a deaf ear to the complaints made by the past boarders/customers, as the hotel personnel should inform the authorities that we left the hotel without staying. It was a case of cheating in the part of Karnataka Government. It is known to common people like us that the hotels/lodges run by Government/state bodies are safer and better places than the private ones.
We hope that Karnataka Government/KSTDC should be ashamed for charging boarders/customers without giving any normal basic amenities and should make booking after developing the hotel and area.

Rameswaram, the holy island in the Gulf of Mannar, is a major pilgrim centre of the country. 
Rameswaram is hallowed by the epic Ramayana. It is believed that Lord Rama sanctified this place by worshipping Lord Shiva here after the war against Ravana of Sri Lanka. 

Therefore, it is held sacred by both Vishnu and Shiva devotees. It is one of the 12 Jyothirlinga shrines (where Lord Shiva is worshipped as a ‘Lingam (pillar) of light’) of India. A devout Hindu who visits Varanasi in the North must also visit Rameswaram for the culmination of his quest for salvation.

With a mix of pine and oak trees as well as a large number of neat gardens and orchards, Kasauli, located in the state of Himachal Pradesh, offers an ideal escape from the steaming plains of northern India. 

Its history, coupled with the pleasant temperate mountain climate and beautiful scenic grandeur, gives it the feel of a colonial charm which, in fact, it once was.

Kanchipuram, the golden city of a thousand temples, was once the capital of the Pallava dynasty. It is considered one of the seven sacred cities of India; some of the best temples were built here during the reign of the Pallavas between the 6th and 7th centuries. Subsequently, Kanchipuram also served as an important city of the far-flung empires of the Chola and the Vijayanagara dynasties.

Later, these dynasties too contributed greatly in the temple building activity of this town. 
The city has also been, through the years, a great seat of learning and culture. Adi Sankaracharya established his episcopal seat (Kamakodipeedam) here. Sri Sankaracharya, Appar, Siruthonder and the great Buddhist Bikshu, Bodhidharma, once lived and worked here. Today, it is known not only for temples but also for its hand-woven, silk fabrics.

Where the hell was their PRS on 1st, 2nd and 3rd June from 10:00 AM to 10:05 AM? 
 .
 .
 As if the PRS was not working, then how the tickets could be regretted during that period? 
 .
 . 
 Who should answer ?... Indian Railway, IRCTC or the airlines company.. 
 .
 .
 Prestige's.. I m regularly bomb shelled by checking the PRS system from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM. The review of activity is like this
 [
 10:00 AM-10:05 AM The PRS system is failed in all India. Still the tickets sold during that period.. this is illogical and bit to surprise.

10:05 AM-10:25 AM a common IRCTC user mainly face a problem related to the payment gateway. 

10:25 AM-12:00 PM Everything becomes normal, if u call the customer care executive.. they will ask for the problem screenshots. And that is resolved in 2 months

I checked the airlines after. The ticket is became costlier than 15,000/-, so, I think its better to fly London or Singapore instead of flying to Ranchi from New Delhi. The prize is even same.

The temples of Khajuraho are India's unique gift to the world, representing, as they do, a paean to life, to love, to joy, perfect in execution and sublime in expression. Life, in every form and mood, has been captured in stone, testifying not only to the craftsman's artistry but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose rule the temples were conceived and constructed. 
The Khajuraho temples were built in the short span of a hundred years, from 950-1050 AD in truly inspired burst of creativity. Of the 85 original temples, 22 have survived till today to constitute one of the world's great artistic wonders.

Visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a unique and exhilarating experience. Spectacular scenery, white sandy beaches and swaying palms combine with monuments and museums, world-class diving, swimming and sun basking make this a truly out-of-the-world experience. 

The Archipelago contains 362 volcanic islands scattered in the Bay of Bengal, with only 37 of these being inhabited. These lush green islands have colourful historical past, with strings of invasions by the French, Dutch, Japanese and British and wars between settlers and the native tribes. The Cellular Jail, where hundreds of Indian revolutionaries were imprisoned during the Indian freedom struggle, still stands tall. 

Descendents of these political prisoners and the local tribes of the area are the inhabitants of modern day Andaman and Nicobar. The tropical rain forests that loom close to the seashore are home to unique species of birds, and to tribes that still haven't learned to use fire.

Vijayanagara, the “City of Victory,” was one of the greatest of all medieval Hindu capitals of South India. Its impressive ruins in central Karnataka are known best as Hampi, after the name of a still populated local village. Traditionally known as Pampakshetra of Kishkindha, Hampi is situated on the southern bank of the river Tungabhadra. 
It was the seat of the mighty Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1565) which extended from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal and from the Deccan Plateau to the tip of the Indian Peninsula. Hampi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
