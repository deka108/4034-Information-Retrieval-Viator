It‚Äôs a ferry ride to Hong Kong Disneyland! Check out the details of Star Ferry's Water tour here: http://bit.ly/2kIZwO0$$This trip is amazing I did it on the 9 th Jan for my 60 th birthday with 6 other friends we did the lunch package which includes the boat crossing and lunch or afternoon tea at the Walt hotel , we went on the 11 am ferry and came back on the 6 pm ferry it takes about an hour each way but there is a bar on board and your ticket includes a drink and snack the trip back is lovely as it dark and you see Hong Kong in its glory , the meal at salts hotel  was very nice and they also made me an amazing birthday cake , you also get access to the Disney transport so we went and had a look around all the hotels ,the cost was approx ¬£40 per person including lunch but just the round trip is about ¬£20 , we were lucky enough to be treated like royalty on the boat as we were the only 7 people on it going out and on the way back there were 4 more people but they were tour guides . Worth doing for a special occasion$$I was in HK a few years back, been  on the star ferry but did not know there was a disney land ?? Is it recent?$$Once in a lifetime experienced Jan 28, 2017 ... its Chinese New Year... from Macau to Hong Kong... and its raining hard when we get there... oh oldies like us can't enjoy the Disney land any more just picture pictures only... happy enough at the gate rather than to pay that much anyway its raining you cant do much walking too inside... do other options back to the malls and do some window shoppings.... happy enough  :-)$$Took my 4 kids here whilst on a busman's holiday 2 years ago, and they loved it, the ferry was great. Disney here is to me just the right size for a day out, but boy was it humid. :) Can't wait to return, neither can the kids.$$We were in Hongkong three times already the last two years ago. We are going again on February 27 for a week tour. Hope the temperature goes up as it is so cold there now.$$Overpriced Disneyland? Should have taken the ferry to one of the many gorgeous islands to enjoy a nice day on a good beach instead :P$$oh can you get the ferry from hk island to disneyland? i will be in hk tomorrow..$$We were also there Disney  Land was our fave  palibhasa we are still Kids je heje$$Maybe u can check tree of life or google it, it may be of help .

I have to be honest regardless of some cruel and archaic cultural tradition I do not understand why this practice is allowed to continue. I know there are many animal rescue groups who are trying desperately to stop the senseless abuse, cruelty and butchering of these poor animals.

In South Korea, thousands of dogs are kept crammed in filthy metal cages. They‚Äôre fed on the carcasses of other dead dogs, and they‚Äôre deeply distressed from a combination of boredom and terror. 
It is the middle of a South Korean winter, there are dogs shivering and whimpering in freezing, open cages. They live their entire lives in factory farm conditions. They have no freedom, no affection, nothing that makes them feel good. And they‚Äôll be butchered so humans can eat their meat. I have heard of the atrocities‚Äîof dogs and cats being boiled alive. Of dogs being baked. Of family dogs being stolen and cooked. The fact that people know this happens and turns a blind eye is not acceptable. To do this is to condone the dog meat trade. It is despicable and one of the basest practices that happens as an industry on this planet. 
As Mahatma Gandhi once said, ‚ÄúThe greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.‚Äù
I ask that your publication bring attention to two important issues: 
‚Ä¢	the existence of the dog meat trade in South Korea
‚Ä¢	whether the relationship between Seoul and your city is appropriate, given the vast difference in standards of animal welfare between the two places.$$Stop tormenting me.

If you have friends who will travel to Hong Kong Island with a tight budget, please ask them to avoid dorms (9/8/7/6/4/3 bunk bed) that spread on a few floors in an apartment mansion (next to locals, they need to go to work in the morning). You might pay lots of money just to sleep on mattress on the floor (far over-priced and incredibly cramped). Hot water may run out 5 minutes after shower (small electric heater). You also need to pay for towels and flip-flops. The sum you pay may be more than an economy hotel. Besides, there‚Äôs no time saving as you need to wait for the washrooms with some travelers (e.g. 30 mins). You can see some good comments but it‚Äôs a ""trap"". If you see there're many beds available and choose to stay, you will be regretted. As I said before, it's a ""trap"". Beware. Search different website, compare and choose carefully.

Also nice own goal by blocking the view from pedestrian overpasses. But you say that it is about safety and keeping the overpasses unobstructed. Except domestic helpers obstruct the overpasses every Sunday and that seems okay. And except the fact that you blocked the windows in the IFC. 

The E formula demonstrated the HK government's sense of entitlement to spend taxpayer money on entertainment for themselves and the ruling class.

Btw, nobody wants more tourists. 55mn already in a city of 7mn. The E formula served no public good at all. But nice job patting yourselves on the back.$$Disgraceful. Not sure the best ¬£2 millions spent for promoting HK. It's only attracted (estimated by officials) 40k tourists and hand full of rich and privilege minorities to enjoy the event.

Fact: For my three-day stay I toured around the city by foot. The only times I rode public transportation were from the Ferry Port going to my hotel and Bus going to the airport. I think t'was a great experience. I really enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the city coz my hometown is pretty much laid back and HK is quite the opposite! Will be back soon for sure!$$Usually i live near causeway bay mtr or, better for me, near tin hau mtr, whitfield Street.  Some tips: West Kowloon culture park...if you Like running go to quarry bay riveraide park so tou can enjoy also a view og kowloon bay. Take the bus from Central to repulse bay and Stanley market...then catch up some small beach for enjoy sun and quiet...come back to North and take a walking on the Mid Levels...then stop for get some good and drink there. Go to Tsim Sha Tsui At 8pm and enjoy the simphony of lights, so nice and so commercial..then so annoying maybe! Don't miss to taste an egg tart and take the ferry to come back to Island.$$I've always stayed in Hotels on, or near to Nathan Road. Everything from the various Markets to high end shopping. And the McDonalds (for the western palate). However, I'd like to try staying across the water next time. Maybe down near the Ding-ding tracks.$$We stayed at Courtyard Marriott in Sha Tin.  A little out of the way but if you time it right, there is a free shuttle that takes you to TST and back.  During our 2 weeks there, we really enjoyed this hotel especially the executive lounge - great snacks and drinks for free!$$You missed my favourite place to stay in HK which I'm not mentioning- you mentioned places around it- as I don't want it any better known than it is! :)$$Langham place (cordis) most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in.

Nice to be out of the complete hustle and bustle but feel like you are in the midst of HK.  Great bus links and eateries around as well as having amazing views of the park and harbour.  Definetely my choice whenever we visit :)$$These places are obvious locations and for tourists who want it safe but where money is not an issue. Other locations next to these locations such as Sheung Wan, Causeway Bay, Hung Hum, and even Tung Chung, are cheaper and just as convenient. The author should explore more than where all the tourists go.$$Loved the Excelsior Hotel on causeway bay . Hotel overlooks the noon day gun which is fired everyday at 12 noon$$Tips for whom travel by themselves to HK in the first time are to ask any information at the booth for visitors at the airport (a red booth), they advise clearly and stay in hostels in Mong Kok not expensive.$$Every time I've stayed in HK it's been at Garden View on McDonnell St, Central and it's a short walk down to the Peak Tram, a little further and you can walk to Central or Admiralty/ Pacific Plaza. Have to agree with the review.$$Courtyard at Connaught Rd. I loved walking around and discovered by accident the elevated walkways. Incredible. And I know not related, but JW Marriott in Macau is awesome. You can access all the pools of Galaxy hotel, as well there. It's beautiful.$$Had a great time there and around Kowloon$$I always stay at Stanford hotel right in Mongkok!!

SYMPHONY OF LIGHTS : Victoria Harbour was a dazzling cityscape on its own, hang around for A Symphony of Lights ‚Äî the nightly multimedia show involving more than 40 buildings on both sides of the harbour. Named the 'World's Largest Permanent Light and Sound Show' by Guinness World Records, coloured lights, laser beams and searchlights perform in an unforgettable all-round spectacle synchronised to music and narration that celebrates the energy, spirit and diversity of Hong Kong. 

2.	CLOCK TOWER: Standing 44-metres tall, the old Clock Tower was erected in 1915 as part of the Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway terminus. The once-bustling station is long gone, but this red brick and granite tower, now preserved as a t, survives as an elegant reminder of the Age of Steam. It has also been a memorable landmark for the millions of Chinese immigrants who passed through the terminus to begin new lives not just in Hong Kong, but in other parts of the world via the city‚Äôs harbour.

3. MADAME TUSSADS HONG KONG: With over 100 incredibly life-like wax figures, Madame Tussauds Hong Kong delivers a fun and interactive celebrity experience in which everyone can either become a star, or just compare themselves to the real thing.

Was in Hong Kong 11-14 Mar 2016, the sky was overcast and rainy. The zen garden of ÂçóËé≤Âõ≠Ê±† is really peaceful. Least expect to find such an impressive garden hidden in Diamond Hill estate. Did not manage to explore the Central Mid-Level Escalator and Stanley Market. Tried the roast goose of Yung Kee (Â∫∏ËÆ∞) but somehow miss the noodles of Wong Chi Kei (ÈªÑÊûùËÆ∞) and congee of Tasty (Ê≠£Êñó) more. Uniquely, Basil Thai (Pacific Place) used the similar noodles (those used to cook ‰∫ëÂêûÈù¢) on their beef noodles; my first to try, it was fantastic. Fortunately, the sky cleared up a little, able to see the beauty of Victoria Harbour before going home. Thank you for making this stay memorable.$$I always thought Hong Kong was all about shopping and theme parks.  I never knew there were mountains and other natural scenic spots to visit as well. #DiscoverHongKong$$#discoverhongkong I want to experience Jumbo Kingdom Floating restaurant which is on Aberdeen harbour.

I never knew it that restaurant floats.$$I never knew that  The Wong Tai Sin (ÈªÉÂ§ß‰ªô) Temple is a popular Taoist temple dedicated to Chinese religions including Buddhism and Confucianism. The founder of the temple said that the immortal Wong Tai Sin told him to build a temple at the site and also told him where to build structures and what to name them. He began to build the temple complex in 1921. There are several halls, temples and pavilions including the Three Saints Hall, the Bronze Pavilion that excludes women and girls, the Archives Hall, the Yue Hing Shrine that has a Buddha, a Confucian hall for the worship of Confucius, and a colorful garden called the Good Wish Garden. The complex has a library for Chinese religious literature. At times, there are hundreds of fortune tellers practicing at the site. People go there to get a prediction of their future, pray for happiness and worship the gods.... i just love it to visit there to fulfill my all wishes  #DiscoverHongKong <3$$""I Never Knew"" that tsing ma bridge in hongkong has story and named after the two island, the tsing yi and ma wan.

In new territory n in mongkok kowloon. Now i missed HK so much .how i wish i would be able to come and visit HK again.$$Hong Kong, I will see you soon. Lilia Pablo- Amansec's ""Lover Boy,"" I will meet Lulu and Mr. E. Sanchez but not the embalmer's. Hahaha$$I miss hongkong so much,its a very nice place to go shopping,pleasure  and visit many other places,, i've been working in hongkong for almost 7 years,,yeah,really imiss hongkong so much,,,,$$To Me HK is the best country that I've been too, I never saw any closed shops there little or big. The best analogy to describe HK is like a smart phone you have all the apps within your reach. Going around is easy by bus although there's a little bit of a learning curve to it but I love the experience. I LOVE HK!$$HONGKONG is nice place to go to shopping,pleasure, and to visit DISNEYLAND and so many places.Many filipino working there.$$I really love Hong-kong.... This is the first country i visited outside our country.. And a memorable one.. Going around hongkong is so easy.  Bus-MTR.. My 7 days vacation in hongkong is not enough..  Hoping to come back again.. Luv u hongkong$$I miss this place hong Kong I miss u hong kong$$I miss the  stunning beauty  and tall buildings of Hong Kong.....$$The panoramic view of kowloon side is inviting more so when you are viewing it with no other my friend sponsor the FIRST GENTLE MAN MIKE ARROYO. GOD BLESS YOU SIR.$$Hong kong is indeed a nice place for leisure visit i had been there wd my 2companions .There are tall buildings all around,I enjoyed much Disneyland especially
the parade of disney characters,the train ride in Grizzly mountain,etc. In Lantau Island we were able to reach the mountain peak where the big Buddha is.We also visited other places.My visit to Hong kong is enjoying and unforgettable.$$Will be visiting for the 3rd time 
I love this place. Staying in the now cordis in mongkok wouldn't stay any where else staying for Western nye this time
Counting down$$Anyway, HK is my 2nd home! I have lived in the territory from 1996-1997 and I myself was there during The Handover.

After that, I divide my time between HK and Manila as I have my interests there and after 7 years got my Permanent Residency.

But I decided to stay in Manila and base my creative studio here. Economy is doing well here plus I find the quality of life in Manila better plus living space.

It may be different now compared back during the last years of British rule.

But despite all the political drama happening there, it is still a nice place to visit.$$For those who think HK is a country, it is not! It is a Special Administrative Region in The People's Republic of China!

But even if HK is under China it has its own system of government and economy. As with the one country two systems policy!$$2 years i worked in WANCHAI, HONGKONG together with my Auntie Cora Nicomedes,jennifer Nicomedes.and late Uncle Teng.Wish to visit again in Hongkong.$$The towering skyscrapers of hong kong beside the kowloon sea in the distant of Victoria peak.$$Hk is my 2nd country and home as well.I missed my days with my very kind hearted employers .I missed the two kids that i've been taking cared.to them i felt the care and love as thier own family.Hk is most wonderful place for bcause of its cleanliness and disciplne.$$I've been there 3x already and still want to go back again and again, hindi nakakasawa. A lovely place.$$Wow Hongkong allow me to visit there to you ....$$Iris Chan If we can climb to the top and see this landscape!!",,,,,,,2016-03-04T10:00:00+0000,2016,March,Friday,False,2016-03-04T10:00:00+0000,2016,March,Friday,False,5,2

love Hongkong! My fmily just vicited HK last Oct 16-21,2015.$$I will be there on 2016 New Years Countdown!$$I love hongkong, i was there with my children$$Keep reading on, or die tonight a exactly
12:42. This
is based on a TRUE STORY! Once there
was
a baby
girl named Marry. Her mother couldn't
take
all the
crying, so she decided it was time for her
to
go. She
buried her baby alive in her back yard.
After she
buried her she could still hear Marry
crying.
So she dug her back up and stabbed her
one
time in the arm,
and buried her again. Marry cried harder,
but a few
hours later it stopped. At exactly 12:42,
Marry died.
She bleed to death. Now her sprite
haunts
the
world. When your sleeping, she stabs
you in
the
arm and watches you bleed to death.
And
that's how she got the name ""Bloody
Marry"" this is the true story
of her. She wants everyone to feel her
pain
that she
felt. Apparently, if you re-post This isn't
fake.
Apparently, if you copy and paste this to
ten
comments in the next ten minuets you
will
have the
best day of your life tomorrow. You will
either get kissed or asked out, if you
brake
this chain you will
see a little dead girl in your room tonight.
In the next
53 minuets someone will say I love you
or
I'm sorry
to 12 other comments you will have the
best day of
your life tomorrow. But if you break this
chain you die
at exactly 12:42 tonight by Bloody Marry.

Tsim Sha Tsui ,Kowloon, prebooked Bigbus tour premium ticket and some of other attractions. For Indians as per law they 
should allow without visa for up to a maximum of 14 days and mine was only 3 days. But the Immigration Authority isolates 
Indians, detained us, refused entry and request us to sign in some forms without giving any explanations and send us to 
India in the Night flight itself. I had explained them that I had came there only for tourism purpose as i had gone to 
Malaysia, Singapore & Thailand every year and also showed i had sufficient money along with International Debit Card. 
But everything goes in wain. Till this time i didn''t know the reason of refusal even though i had a Confirmed Return Ticket.

He is actually an American. When he was born, he was given the name ""Bruce"" by his nurse.

If he was born in Shanghai, he would not have an English name, as Shanghai was not a colony of the British or the US. If he was born in Kowloon (Hong Kong), he would have his name transliterated into English ""Lee Jun Fan"" and probably would have not picked the name ""Bruce"".

The Central ‚Äì Mid-Levels Escalator system, the world's longest outdoor covered escalator system, running for 800 meters. It links Des Voeux Road Central to Conduit Road in the Mid- Levels.

There are a total of 20 separate escalators with streets that bi-sect the system running all over the district of Soho, which is a very fashionable district with many bars, cafes and restaurants. It really is a convenient way to see the bustling city hillside and daily Hong Kong life. 

Traveling the entire length takes about 20 minutes. The escalators are free of charge and run downhill between 6am and 10am and uphill from 10:30am to midnight.

7.	Wished an elderly panda and a robotic Japanese cat happy birthday, shivered with perky penguins and laughed at a mouthy mudskipper. 
8.	Reassessed your doubts and went back to Lan Kwai Fong to study the fascinating variety of beers and food the world has to offer.
9.	Rocked to the sounds of DJ beats, retro 80s, local indie, Cantonese opera and musicians playing in total darkness.
10.	Travelled back in time to the American West or 50s Hong Kong. 
11.	Became a gourmet, anime fan, kung fu prot√©g√© and knit-fitti enthusiast.

As you are reading this letter, I bet that you have seen/heard about what happened earlier in our country.

Tourists were hostages of a policeman here, Rolando Mendoza. After a few hours of the horrible crime, some of the victims were dead including the hostage-taker.

I wrote this letter not just to apologize but also to let everyone know that we Filipinos are not all like Mendoza. We are loving and good-hearted people.

For so many years, our country has been standing tall and surpassing every dilemma; be it small or big. Years ago (back when I wasn‚Äôt born yet), you have watched us fight for what we think is right. We fought for the democracy of our nation.. The EDSA revolution. But that‚Äôs just one out of many.

Second. We Filipinos have been serving other countries for our families and we treat you as our own as well. With all due respect, I thank you all for giving us the trust through the years. For helping us to become what we are now.

The Philippines is more than just a group of islands. We are a nation of strong and remarkable people. A country of beauty and love known to be hospitable and well-valued. I humbly apologize for what happened tonight. No one in this world would want something like that to happen for life should be valued.

I politely ask the attention of the world. Please do not judge and mistreat us just because of what happened tonight. I have been searching the net and found terrible things. Hong Kong advices to avoid travels here, China and HK bans Filipinos and that Philippines is the worst place to go.

I can‚Äôt blame you for what you have decided but I hope that you could understand. Our country is now in a sea of problems. And I know for sure that we helped you in a way or another. Let peace and understanding reign this time.

I know that this letter will just be trash but I wish that you would understand. On behalf of the Philippine population.. WE ARE SORRY.$$FOR FREE !! to those from Hong Kong and Macao ! from now u can apply entry permit ""from the internet"" and then print it down, dispensing with NT 300, the period of validity of this entry permit application is three months long, and u can use it once for one month long staying Taiwan !
