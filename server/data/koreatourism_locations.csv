Though #subways are very convenient, #buses are also a great mode of transportation to explore the city! Did you know, the buses in Seoul are classified as follow:
- #Blue Bus: Buses that travel on major roads and run for relatively long distances through Seoul.
- #Green Bus: Buses that travel shorter distances 
- #Red Bus: Rapid buses that travel from Seoul to suburban areas
- #Yellow Bus: Circular route buses, quite rare

Also, the first 2 digits of the bus numbers show their departure & arrival region. For example, Bus No. 7011 departs from 'Eunpyeong' to 'Jung-gu' and thus the number starts with '7' followed by '0'.

이번 기회에 서울타워 색깔의 의미를 꼭 알아두세요.

*빨간색: 미세먼지, 초미세먼지 경보가 발령된 경우
*파란색: 초미세먼지 농도가 20㎍/m³이하일 경우 
*초록색: 초미세먼지 농도가 20㎍/m³초과하고 미세먼지·초미세먼지 경보가 없는 경우  

*참고로, 현재 N서울타워는 빨간색, 파란색, 초록색 세 가지 색깔 조명만 켠답니다. 예전에 켰던 보라색과 노란색, 흰색 조명은 더 이상 사용하지 않는다고 해요.
