The earthquake that rocked the mountain on the 5th of June, 7:15am triggered landslides along with rocks and boulders that tumbled down, destroying trails and sadly, taking lives. Joseph was found beneath a boulder, in the heroic act of shielding two of his guests. Unfortunately, the three of them didn‚Äôt survive.

Joseph was last seen hugging two of his guests, in an attempt to protect them, using his body as a shield, an account related by his fellow mountain guide colleague, Sharulnizam Suhaji. Sharulnizam describes Joseph as an easy-going person with a good heart, soft-spoken and always kind. 

Joseph has been a member of our team for almost 2 months. He has brought nothing but good memories and experiences for our fellow climbers. A man of courage and uncompromising thoughtfulness. His good-will and high-spirits will forever be remembered by all the lives he has touched.

Joseph left behind a loving wife, a 4-year old son and a 2-year old daughter. He promised his wife that he will come back to celebrate their wedding anniversary on the 12th of June. Our heartfelt condolences goes out to his family and to those affected.

Located at a busy intersection between Jalan Tun Razak and Jalan Semarak, this restaurant is popular among locals. the coals are furiously fanned to give a fiery flame upon which the satays are grilled to give them a charcoal smoke aroma, caramelised sugar & fat combo hence crispy chunks of meat on the outside with juicy insides.

The drive to Sekinchan is scenic with oil palm trees along the coastal road, stalls selling handmade cotton pillows, eateries offering a wide variety of local delicacies and almost in the middle of nowhere, vast expanses of paddy fields bordering a stretch of fishing villages.

The picturesque landscape in Sekinchan especially when the sun sets against the vast padi fields and stretch of fishing villages is the one of the many reasons why visitors call this town 'a photographer‚Äôs haven'.

A MUST-VISIT for photographers.  :)

But the best place is travelling from Kuala Kangsar towards Jeli-Kelantan. I fell in love with The Royal Belum Forest n Temenggor Lake n the Jungle of Perak.$$My family and I went to Belum Rainforest and Lake Temenggor in June 2001.  We had an awesome trip - exploring the lower part of Belum where we trekked up the slippery ground in search of the famous rafflesia, an eye-opening visit to the  aborigines village where life is very simple and basic and time seems to stand still, and a tiring but rewarding trek up to Sungai Enam Base Camp where we had a refreshing dip in the cool waterfall. 

We were there for 5 days, exploring the Banding trail, belum rainforest, the nearby town of Gerik (we had lovely chats with the friendly locals and I got to try the ikan pekasam which I like so much) and even managed a day trip to Betong, Thailand through the Pengkalan Hulu border. I must say that our trip to Belum was very exciting and adventurous for us. We even enjoyed the long road trip (we drove abt 10 hrs all the way from S'pore to Banding), taking in the lovely sights of the natural landscape that 'paints' the state of Perak.$$The 40,000-hectare Matang Mangrove Forest in Kuala Sepetang. Today, it is recognized as the best managed sustainable mangrove ecosystem in the world. Lots of interesting activities can be done, such as strolling on wooden boardwalk, replanting of saplings, studying numerous ways of fishing, bird watching, and much more!$$Had a blast of a time wid my family at Pangkor last June.Although a bit quiet, we had the pool at Anjungan Resort almost to ourselves.Saw lots of  the famous hornbills of Pangkor n done our dried seafood shopping galore.We love the tranquillity n peace of the island :-)$$I just came back from Jalan Bukit Merah Laketown Resort at Perak with my family.

This message is to all the plantations owners, corporations, investors and whoever is making the decision to burn the forest & mass killing of all the animals in their natural habitat worst than an act of ""Terrorism"". 

You have the choice to develop the land without ""Burning"". Although this takes a longer time, you create jobs for the poor and at the same time allow the  animals to migrate. Such actions will be ""Bless"" by the whole World,  
especially Singaporean.

Now with your decision to ""Burn"" not only causing Haze but also killing all the animals in it path, you are ""Cursed"" every second, minute, hour & day. 

What good is it to have all the ""Money in the World"" when you, your family and probably your decedents are Cursed all your life ?

No one will hope you will live longer and to make more money !

LHL, our Gov and Singaporean  are being laugh at and insulted for their efforts to stop you from Burning.

LKY life time effort & trust building up Singapore for Singaporean is being destroy by your selfish act of ""Burning""

This is not a laughing matter, the entire Singapore and the World will hope you will be caught and punish.

Perhaps with the money and connections you can escape the Law, but definitely you cannot escape the ""CURSEs"" until you take immediate action to stop burning now and future.

Move a little more Melaka, place for heritage trail & night market jonker street. specialty food of satay, luk luk steamboat & my favorite of cheesy. steamboat. Kuala Lumpur great city for shopping. Great shopping malls at Bukit.Bintang & great food street like Alor. Genting great place for Young & Old. A get away place from the hot weather. Great mountain, white beaches, different tribes are just the many reasons for East Malaysia.  A great close destination, our neighbour, Malaysia Truly Asia.....$$Malaysia offers one of the most ideal destination for travel. Malaysia offers a varied range of activities from the highlands of Cameron Highlands and the lush greenery of the oldest rainforest to the white sandy beaches. There is always that city limelights that beckons you for a night out of fun or self indulgence. The ethnic diversity is shared in the myriad colours in traditional wear, the culinary delight that is shared by all and the warmth welcoming hospitality greeted you as you travel around Malaysia . From the Portugese settlers in Melaka to the unique Baba culture to the 3 main ethnic group, there is always an experience and a sweet memory to savior.$$Truly Malaysia with lots of friendly faces, nice local delights and free from war. Malaysia has lots of facinating places which could reduce our stress life in Singapore$$I love to travel to KL and its outskirts.   It offers both new modern shopping centres of mega scales like One Utama or Midvalley to Hypermarkets like Tesco to wholesale like Kenaga etc and yet you can find diversity in old shops in many areas to pasar malam in different vicinity and the open markets like in Jalan Ara.  Simply love the mood when I can go slow or at a fast pace,  the crowd yet you don't find it claustrophobic , the buzz and lively atmosphere you may find at Pavillion dining boulevard close to midnight and above all I felt relaxed each time I am there.  

The main draw for me is the food scene and you are spoilt for choices.  Each time I am there I never fail to make new discoveries and I am so often thrilled by the gem of the new found place and the smacking good food it offers.  

I indulged in the many nice hotels that abounds in KL and I am a frequent customer of Prince Hotel, my favorite accommodation in KL for its image, service, accessibility and proximity to the shopping belts and a short walk away from the midnight movie that I catch at the Pavillion.   

Taxis have been my favorite mode of transportation, so easily available and I always got a wealth of information on places to drink and dine and places of interest.

Truly it's a haven for tourist like me!$$Warm Malaysian Hospitality,authentic local delights,culture and traditions,homestay,indulge in various village pastimes,agro visits delights of rural living$$I love foremost the exotic beaches at Redang, green lushful mountains in Kedah the hilly stations. Shopping in KLCC is awesome and can never be enough. Foods are finger licking and many Halal certified restaurant. Last but not least, Malaysians are friendly by nature and approachable.$$1st & foremost love to go holiday to Malaysia because of the foods that really appeal to my appetite. Stay in their exclusive 5 star hotel & visit their interesting attractions place that sure brings me & family to go holiday to Malaysia. We plan to go holiday to Kelantan to visit my long penpal when I get to know her I was in my teens.$$From the crystal blue waters around the famed island of Sipadan, where divers are surrounded by turtles, schools of jacks and the chance to dive around the only island that is not connected to any continent. To the idyllic island of Langkawi where one can relax under a beach umbrella at Pantai Cenang idling away your time.

Stopping over in Malacca for the foodie lover and moving on to Kuala Lumpur to indulge more in local food and shopping. To burn away all that excess calories, why not opt being 'Tarzan or Jane' for a day and traverse between tree to tree at SkyTrek Adventure Park? If climbing is not your cup of tea, perhaps exploring Mulu caves in Sarawak may bring you back to nature. 

For the adrenaline junkie, Sepang tracks await you and if you do not have a car to speed your way through the tracks, how about Go-karting instead?

So with that many options available and many more places to explore just a doorstep away, how can Malaysia not attract me over?$$Malaysis is the one of the most pleasant, hassle-free countries to visit in 
S.E.A. Its buoyant and wealthy culture based on a vibrant fusion of Malay, Chinese and Indian .
Malaysia has a wide range of tourist attraction. This include the hi-tech city Kuala Lumpur to the tropical island if Langkawi. Malaysia has the potential of catering to tourist of every hue and truly lives up to its tag line of Malaysia truly Asia.$$The diversity of the unique cultural traditions, the well-deserved reputation of food heaven in South East Asia and the friendliness of the people there are simply so welcoming.  It is like a home away from home. A perfect place for a getaway, to rest and to relax. For this, i am truly in love with Malaysia.$$Have u seen Rafflesia in Sabah ? its so attractive and cannot move your eyes aways from it. i saw six.

Just a feedback. My family and I have been wanting to explore Trengganu and its beautiful islands for quite some time now. But honestly, we have shelved the idea as there is no direct flight to Kuala Trengganu from either Changi Airport or Senai. At present the flight to Trengganu via KLIA is a no brainer as its involves a stop-over and price-wise, fyi, it is cheaper for us to fly to Koh Samui or Phuket. On the other hand, we will not travel by bus as the journey is impossibly long for our kids. So while we want to support tourism in Malaysia, I think its about time for MAS, Firefly or Airasia do the right thing! I am hoping for a positive response as I do want to see more success in the tourism sector in East Malaysia which has lots of potential and is indeed an untapped market at present. Thanking you in advance.$$Dear Naharudin Shariff, thank you for your feedback.
