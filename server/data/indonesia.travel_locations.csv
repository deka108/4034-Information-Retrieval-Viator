"Batik is a technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to whole cloth, or cloth made using this technique. The word of batik is derived from the word “ambatik” which means “a cloth with little dots”. The suffix “tik” means “little dot, drop, point or to make dots”. Batik may also originate from the Javanese word “tritik” which describes a resist process for dying where the patterns are reserved on the textiles by tying and sewing areas prior to dying, similar to tie dye techniques. Another Javanese phase for the mystical experience of making batik is “mbatik manah” which means ”drawing a batik design on the earth”.

Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting or by printing resist with a copper stamp called a cap. The applied wax itself resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to color selectively by soaking the cloth in the one color, removing the wax with boiling water and repeating the process if multiple colors are desired.

Batik which made in the island of Java has a long history of acculturation, with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures, and is the most developed in terms of pattern, technique and the quality of workmanship. On October 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian Batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. http://ow.ly/RydRE
