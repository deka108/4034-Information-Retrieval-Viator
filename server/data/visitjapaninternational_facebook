… but these “monsters” are actually known as the Juhyo phenomenon. Strong winds over a nearby lake carry water droplets, which flash freeze on tree branches to form horizontal icicles. When enough falling snow settles on these icicles, the snow monsters of Zao are born.
The Juhyo season is typically from end of December to the end of February. The frosted trees are most prominent in January and the number of snow monsters peaks in the following month with increased snowfall. Discover the mystic world of the Juhyo and stick around for the world-class skiing and hot springs!

The facility was built using a modern interpretation of traditional Japanese architecture and interior design. It features a variety of traditional arts and crafts such as urushi lacquer, Nishijin woven silks, bamboo woodwork, and so on.

This is a ceremonial visit paid by families to their guardian shrines so that parents can offer gratitude for their childrens’ health and well-being. Celebrations are carried out on November 15th or the month of November for boys who reach the age of 3 or 5, or for girls who turn 3 or 7 years old. The custom is for the children to dress in their best clothes and to carry “Chitose-ame” which are long thin candy sticks colored in red and white, believed to bring good luck. If you are visiting in November, you will have a chance to see this at the shrines throughout Japan.

Be sure to write your very own “ema” while visiting Japan!

Do you like rice, but don’t own a rice cooker? No need to worry, you can cook rice in a pot!
First, wash the rice and place in a pot. Add water (rice to water ratio is 1: 1.2) and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it is boiling, cover with lid and let simmer for 12-15 minutes over low heat. Remove the pot from heat (with the lid still on) and let steam for another 10 minutes.
With these simple steps, you can taste soft, fluffy rice whenever you want!

According to Japanese tradition, if you eat the same number of beans as your age, you will enjoy a year of good health. Would you like to try it?

This elegant festival actually lasts for one month in July, and has its two highlights, Saki-Matsuri, procession of 23 gorgeous floats will be held on July 17th, 9 am to 11:25 am and Ato-Matsuri, a procession of another 10 floats starts at 9:30 am on July 24th. 
Yoi-yama (Festival Eve), all floats with lighted lanterns are exhibited on the Shijo- Karasuma Area, is held on the evening from July 14th to 16th, and also from July 21st to 23rd. 
Not many people know about Byobu Matsuri (Displaying folding screen). During the festive period, from July 14th to 16th, the old textile merchant homes open up the entrance area of their homes or shops once a year. This would be an absolutely great opportunity.

Additionally, the Asahikawa Heiwa-dori Shopping Street in Asahikawa City, Hokkaido, introduced the new tax-free system on June 1, 2015. 
Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5,001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10,001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district.

For example, buy some Japanese teas, a kimono and anything else you fancy on the shopping street, and when you have finished shopping, just go to the tax refund counter in Seibu Department Store. Enjoy shopping at bargain prices, and take a little taste of Japan back home with you.

Asahikawa City has many other attractions besides shopping, and also a great destination for travelling. Please come and visit!

Until now, it was necessary to perform the tax-free procedure each time for every one store visited. But in the new system, tax-free procedure can be combined with the goods purchased in multiple stores, such as within shopping streets.

Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5, 001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10, 001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district.

At the tax-free stores in Omotemachi Shopping Street and Romantic-dori Shopping Street, you may purchase Japanese traditional sweets, tea utensils or Japanese tea, and then operating procedure tax refund at the tax-free counter of Tenmaya department store.

The postbox's design is selected regarding the regional characteristic. 
For example, can you think the yellow post looks like owl? The yellow one is in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, called “Ikefukuro”. 
Why? Because the pronunciation of Owl in Japanese, “Fukuro” almost the same as Ike“bukuro”.

The white postbox is in Ueno, Tokyo. There is the Ueno Zoo where the two Giant pandas were brought first time in Japan, 1972.

“DARUMA” is one of the well-known lucky charms of Japan.
The doll is modeled after Bodhidharma who is the founder of Zen sect of Buddhism, and it is traced back to more than 200 years.
When DARUMA is sold, both eyes are not painting. When you purchased it, you draw an iris on left eye. And when your wish came true, you paint an iris on right eye.

Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture, is most famous for production of DARUMA doll.
In the city, there is DARUMA-JI temple, where you can see lots of DARUMA dedicated to the temple after making people’s wishes come true. 

From Tokyo to Takasaki station, 1h 30min by Shinkansen, bullet train. Then, it takes 20 min by bus to the temple.

To enjoy gingko tree viewing, there are many popular places in the city center.

Meiji Jingu Gaien in Shinjuku is famous for its roadsides trees. The “Golden Road,” indeed, looks like a beautiful painting. And, the National Diet Building is surrounded by the trees. As wind blows, the gingko leaves turn into a golden carpet on road and you can imagine how amazing the scene is.

In the suburb of Tokyo, Showa Kinen Park which is located in Tachikawa City, you can enjoy gingko tree viewing with a cup of green tea at a Japanese garden.

Let’s find out why they are said like this.
Maybe one of reasons is using natural material cosmetics in a daily life.

Tsubaki oil (camellia-seed oil) used since 7th century, is effective in moisturizing and cutting off ultraviolet rays. Not only women use, sumo wrestlers use it to tie up their hair, and kabuki actors use it as their make-up base. 
Azuki bean has been used as skincare among upper class ladies from the ancient time. It accelerates blood flow, therefore it is good for getting rid of pimples and smoothing your skin. 
Komenuka (rice bran) is highly praised for its effect on beautifying skin. Its vitamins remove spots and works for anti-aging. 

For your information, cosmetics will be one of the tax-free products since this October.
It would be wonderful to buy Japanese cosmetics that suit your skin condition.

This is my invention I made a few days ago to fight the governments consistent gang stalking that never stops . The U.S. government use silent sound RF frequencies to hack into your brain and administer mind control threw Tv and radio by using radio frequencies . This is the combination of over 2 and a half years work and building things and frequencies that work and heal the mind and body . I was working with only sound up until a few days ago and now I have built a RF frequency silent sound negative RF protection modulator using the 4 separate sound devices and several frequencies I have compiled that work to shut them out and shut them down for good . I don't have much money and if I did I could build a proper sound silent sound modulator that could be un hackable .Due to lack of funds I am using my computer and that is the biggest down fall of this mechanism because they can hack and piggy back off the media players and distort the frequencies from being how they should be .This could easily be solved with a stereo tuner and multiple sound devices and a mixer . All these things I do not have .Also with a more powerful transmission device I could heal the planet in a matter of days . Even the radiation from FUKUSHIMA could be healed in a matter of weeks if not days . Rf frequencies effect you on a molecular level and could do the same for water if a powerful enough Rf modulator was built broadcasting the Binural frequency called Radiation detox . Now I know why the U.S. Government takes it down when I put it on line for people to use for free . This frequency kills radiation .This could also be used to kill infected plants and people and The Earth infected with Chem trails and GMO . I am sure of it so please spread the word and please help me in any way you can . Be blessed and walk in the light .

1. Please do not turn your face when you are walking across the bridge.

When this time of year comes around, people write their wishes on strips of paper and hang them on bamboo trees, along with decorations. You can see this almost everywhere in Japan.

It is located in the central east of Akita Prefecture. The deepest point of the lake is 423.4 meters and shape is almost perfectly circle. However cold the weather can be in winter, the Lake is so deep that it wouldn’t freeze at all.

Let us tell you the myth about this girl “Tatsuko” in the golden statue.
There was a girl, Tatsuko, in the area of Lake Tazawa. Everybody knew she was beautiful and attractive. One day when she realized she truly owns beauty, she started clinging to it. She did not want to lose neither her beauty nor the youth. She wanted them forever that she went to shrine to ask for a help. “Guanyin”(enlightenment being in Buddhism) suggested her to drink water of the lake as much as possible. She kept drinking with suffer, gradually, she turned into “tatsu” (dragon). Since then, she started living in the Lake. Her husband experienced the same thing in the northern lake. He, also in a dragon shape, came to Lake Tazawa, and they have lived together. Having two owners, Lake Tazawa got deeper and deeper.

Walking around the castle town, you can come across remains and history of the city.
Though only some part of the castle is remained, you can learn more about Aobajo, at the CG theatre. The CG received an award in the international CG competition, when world famous “Jurassic Park” won the same one. Worth watching! Anime lovers out there, check out “Sengoku Basara”!

In Tokyo, you will be seeing Arts, Nature and traditional architecture at some cafés…
Once you order a latte, some cafes might offer you “Latte Art”. As it is common to order Matcha (Green tea) latte in Japan, you can enjoy Matcha Latte Art in Tokyo. It’s almost a shame to drink it. 
You will also be amazed that you can feel nature in the middle of this big city. There are some cafes with a lot of trees and placing next to a garden. 
Have you ever visited a “Kominka” such as a Japanese old-styled house? You can feel relaxed in a Japanese traditional house ordering your favorite foods & drinks.
If you would like to have a special experience in Tokyo, visit some interesting cafes while you are traveling.
If you have already visited a café in Tokyo, please let us share your special experience.

The famous and unique food in Ouchi-juku is “Negi-soba” (leek buckwheat noodles)! You will use leek to have the noodle instead of using chopsticks!

One tip: if you're coming from a country where you drive on the right side of the road, switch your brake cables around from left to right.  The two biggest reasons for doing this are: 1) If you brake while you hand signal you wont be squeezing the front brake, which can cause you to flip over head first, and 2) you can use your right hand to drink from your water bottle--as well as a lot of other things--safely.$$Did 17km with 2 local guides, cycling is a great way to explore. http://www.hiroshimatours.info/?page_id=1041$$I'll keep that in mind when I visit.

Today we introduce Yabusame Shinto Ritual events which will be held at Shimogamo Shrine on May 3rd in Kyoto. Yabusame is a traditional art of horseback archery which used to be for centuries an important part of Samurai discipline. The event is starting from 1:00p.m., but here is a secret tip that you can enjoy Yabusame!
Try getting up early to visit morning practice in the shrine. You can take your time among so few spectators and closely watch archers harmonizing themselves with horses, their skill with their spirit in the crisp morning air. They will take you back a millennium to the age of the Samurai.
If you missed this time, don’t worry! The rituals of Yabusame are took place in spring and autumn festivals at famous shrines.

Master trainers of cormorants dressed in ancient costume freely manipulate 10-12 wild sea cormorants to skillfully catch small trout. This fishing is performed every night between May 11th and October 15th except during a full moon or in heavy rain. You can watch the entire spectacle aboard a small wooden boat while dining and drinking sake!

Sakuramochi in Area of Kanto (Around Tokyo) and Kansai (Around Osaka and Kyoto) is different. The Kanto style Sakuramochi has a crepe-like wrapping around bean paste and has an oblong shape.
The Kansai style has a round shape and bean paste is wrapped with a rice cake. Why not try both of them and see the difference? (Photo Left: Kansai Style, Right: Kanto Style)

In Japan, Buddhist temple bells are rung 108 times beginning at midnight on New Year’s Eve.
Why 108 times? One explanation for the bell-ringing is that this is done to forswear the 108 human desires.
Some temples allow ordinary people to ring their bells, so check the temples near you if you are in Japan. Or hear the sound of the bells and welcome the New Year!

Celebrations are carried out on November 15th for boys who reach the age of 3 or 5, or for girls who turn 3 or 7 years old.

How about trying ""nabe"" or Japanese hot pot dishes? :)
 
Did Sukiyaki or Shabu-Shabu come up to your mind as nabe?
There are actually a whole bunch of different types of it in each area of Japan. New types of nabe keep coming up lately, such as Tonyu (Soymilk)-nabe, Tomato-nabe, Carbonara-nabe, and even Collagen-nabe (can you even imagine what it would taste like?)! You can put any food you want into the pot, so the sky is the limit!
 
Nabe-Pa, which stands for ""Nabe Party,"" is very popular in winter among Japanese college students as they enjoy making and eating it together with friends.

Recently B-gourmet championship competitions are a hot topic and interest in the genre is on the rise.  Local yaki-soba dishes hold the champion throne in recent years.  Yaki-soba is a dish made of stir-fried or grilled noodles that is popular both at home and in booths at festivals.  Different regions often feature their own different cooking methods and seasonings. Hiruzen yaki-soba from Okayama Prefecture took the champion title last year.  Do you have a B-gourmet dish you want to tell everyone about?
