Anilao, Batangas

What is it?
Funny how a dive site that has the Tagalog word of garbage for its name is one of the best dive spots in Anilao. A lot of interesting creatures can be spotted in Basura — octopuses, seahorses, tiny frogfishes, ghost pipefish, and tiny shrimps. This area is classified as a muck dive site, hiding all those species under a viscous sea of mud. Come to think of it, the name's making a little more sense now.

Fun Fact:
You can go for a diving expedition to a Spanish galleon which sank in 1620. Visibility is good, and the site is home to many beautiful fish and corals. Just ask your tour guides to show you the way.

The Simhastha Kumbh is an unrivalled celebration in India. The most popular legend regarding the origin of Kumbh Melas is the Samudra Manthan or 'churning of the ocean'. Gods and demons competed ¬ercely in the churning in search of the divine nectar of immortality. During this epic battle to capture the Urn (Kumbh) containing the nectar, drops of the precious liquid fell on four places – Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Nashik and Ujjain. Hence, river Kshipra became the enhancer of life and to celebrate this event since then the grand festival came in vogue. Kumbh Mela, is held once every twelve years at these four places and attracts millions of devotees.

Grand Simhastha, on the Ghats of the glorious Kshipra

The Ujjain Kumbh is celebrated when Jupiter ascends into sun sign Leo's quarter or the Simha constellation of zodiac, which is why it is called 'Simhastha'. The Simhastha is special in Ujjain as it is the seat of divine Mahakal - the Lord of all times. The ritual of bathing in the holy waters of Kshipra begins on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (March-April) and continues on various dates until the full moon shows up in the following month of Vaishakha.

Simhastha 2016 will begin on 22nd of April and will continue till 21st of May.

Sadhus of various sects from across the country assemble in Ujjain and mingle with ordinary people as they take their ritual dip in the holy waters of the Kshipra.!

These are successful stories of our tourism frontliners who prove how inclusive the tourism industry can be. Their stories are told by various local travelers around the Philippines whose journey would not have been more fun and much easier without the help they got from their newfound friends.

This week, we begin with the story of Jacob Maentz (@jacob.maentz on Instagram), a documentary and travel photographer from Cebu:

""I met Captain Angel Torres in Bais Bay during an early morning excursion to see the dolphins of Tañon Strait. Tañon Strait lies between Negros Oriental and Cebu and is the largest protected seascape in the country. It is home to spinner dolphins, dwarf sperm whales, spotted dolphins and pygmy killer whales. Today, a number of fishermen and other locals work part-time as captains or crew for some 15 boat tours around Tañon Strait, Angel being one of them. Visitors can get a glimpse of the marine mammals during early morning dolphin-watching trips.

""Back in the early 90’s dolphin meat was sold for P10 per kilo and was a common part of the local diet. Marine species would also be hunted for pure sport, mainly because no one knew any better explained Angel. In the mid-1990’s much of that changed when the LGU implemented a number of environmental laws to protect the dolphins and whales in the area.  Tourism now provides a livelihood for local fishermen and the marine life is better protected. ""

Bodhgaya, the most important site of Buddhist pilgrimage in the world, is situated in the state of Bihar. 

The place is a sacred site of the first order, and its central temple, the UNESCO World Heritage listed Mahabodhi Temple, is an obligatory stop on the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit. 

Adjacent to the Mahabodhi Temple is the Bodhi tree itself under which Prince Siddhartha Gautama is said to have attained Enlightenment 2,500 years ago. As a result he became the Buddha - the Enlightened One. Bodh Gaya or Uruvela, as it was known during Buddha’s times, is also a major pilgrimage centre for Hindus as Buddha is considered to be the ninth incarnation of Vishnu.

Siargao, Surigao del Norte

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

""I saw your recent post regarding future Singapore MRT/LRT maps and thought I’d throw mine into the ring. The Singapore MRT has long been one of my fave metro systems around the world. 

I like the concept of destination numbers and station numbers - I believe it is one of the first, if not the first, to use this concept (do let me know if that’s not quite right).  

My approach for this map is to incorporate the station number into the station marker itself to avoid some of the clutter associated placing the station name AND the number alongside the station marker.  

Also, I really wanted the Circle Line to be a circle, so I have adopted a few distortions to make that happen. Finally, I tried to incorporate geography of Singapore in a stylistic manner to further reinforce the circle motif.

Schooling is when a group of fish swim together in one direction. They do this to fend off predators by creating a “confusion effect,” where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

Fun Fact: 
Shoaling is different from schooling. Shoaling is when a species of fish are grouped close together, but are swimming independently. Tubbataha has 600 species of fish that either school or shoal.

We leave our empty drinks in our movie cinemas seats. Random tissue papers are always floating on MRT seats. We choke drains with our cigarrates. And we don't even think twice about it. Because garbage on the street is better than in our pockets. 

Some of us have become so entitled that we say we ""help"" the cleaners by giving them a ""job"" to do. That's when you know something is wrong. Maybe that's why we don't return our food trays.

I'm guilty for being part of those groups at parties who don't clean up well, leaving cleaners with a ton of extra work to do. It seems normal when no one seems to care. But I'm not going to act that way again.

Additionally, the Asahikawa Heiwa-dori Shopping Street in Asahikawa City, Hokkaido, introduced the new tax-free system on June 1, 2015. 
Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5,001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10,001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district.

For example, buy some Japanese teas, a kimono and anything else you fancy on the shopping street, and when you have finished shopping, just go to the tax refund counter in Seibu Department Store. Enjoy shopping at bargain prices, and take a little taste of Japan back home with you.

Asahikawa City has many other attractions besides shopping, and also a great destination for travelling. Please come and visit!

Puerto Princesa, Palawan

What is it?
If you love having personal space, then Puerto Princesa is the place for you. It's the city with lowest population density in the country, and the second largest in terms of land area. It has many beach resorts and seafood restaurants, and has been acclaimed on several occasions as the cleanest city in the Philippines.

Fun Fact:
The place got its name from Princess Asuncion, the daughter of Queen Isabella II of Spain. She died at a young age, and her mother honored her by calling the island, Puerto de la Princesa.

How to Get There:

During Good Friday, the island is supposedly the go-to place of witchdoctors from all over the country who are looking to recharge their amulets.

Fun Fact:
Local healers can concoct potions made from oils and herbs for visitors to take home. A scented lana (coconut oil-based ointment) made by a healer is believed to relieve one of stomach aches and body pains.

Calanggaman Island, Leyte

What is it like? 
By those who know about it, this ten-hectare hidden gem is adored for its supremely fine white sands. But the real adventure begins below the surface – with up to 30-meter visibility and an expansive reef, this marine reserve also provides a mystifying dive experience.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Calbayog or Tacloban.                                           Or take a bus from Manila to Tacloban.                                           Or take a boat from Cebu to Calbayog or Ormoc.

Fun Fact: 
The island gets its name from the Cebuano word for bird, possibly owing to the two sandbars that stretch out like wings from its shores.

Let’s find out why they are said like this.
Maybe one of reasons is using natural material cosmetics in a daily life.

Tsubaki oil (camellia-seed oil) used since 7th century, is effective in moisturizing and cutting off ultraviolet rays. Not only women use, sumo wrestlers use it to tie up their hair, and kabuki actors use it as their make-up base. 
Azuki bean has been used as skincare among upper class ladies from the ancient time. It accelerates blood flow, therefore it is good for getting rid of pimples and smoothing your skin. 
Komenuka (rice bran) is highly praised for its effect on beautifying skin. Its vitamins remove spots and works for anti-aging.

And, as usual, he’ll be out on the town enjoying the atmosphere. “I come here alone but I’m never alone once I get here,” says John, who has made lifelong friends at the event. “Other places don’t appreciate the Sevens like Hong Kong.

Sanchi’s stupas, monasteries, temples and pillars dating from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The most famous of these monuments, Stupa 1, known as the Great Stupa, was originally built by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, the then governor of Ujjayini, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant from the adjacent town of Vidisha. Their son Mahindra and daughter Sanghamitra were born in Ujjayini and sent to Sri Lanka, where they converted to king, the queen and their people to Buddhism.

The Sanchi hill goes up in shelves with Stupa 2 situated on a lower shelf, Stupa 1, Stupa 3, the 5th century Gupta Temple No.17 and the 7th century temple No. 18 are on the intermediate shelf and a later monastery is on the crowning shelf. The balustrade surrounding Stupa 2, carved with aniconic representations of the Buddha, was added in the late 2nd century BC under the Satavahanas.

The adjacent Gupta temple no.17 was hailed by Sir John Marshall as one of the most rationally organized structures in Indian architecture. Though small, it was a herald of all the principles which went into the engineering of an Indian temple in the early medieval period. The Buddhas in the perambulatory surrounding Stupa 1 are not contemporary with the Stupa but belong to the Gupta period in the mid-5th century AD. The monastery and the temple with the tall pillars adjacent to Stupa 1 and the temple near the monastery on the crowning shelf illustrate the evolution of the architectural form after the 5th century Gupta temple.
