Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.


Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

First, wash the rice and place in a pot. Add water (rice to water ratio is 1: 1.2) and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it is boiling, cover with lid and let simmer for 12-15 minutes over low heat. Remove the pot from heat (with the lid still on) and let steam for another 10 minutes.

Fly from Manila to Cagayan de Oro.

Or take a boat from Manila, Iloilo or Cebu to Cagayan de Oro.

Then take a bus to Balingoan, and then a boat to Camiguin Island.

What is it?
Camiguin is known as ""the island born of fire"" because of its seven volcanoes. It’s a less touristy site, with most visitors coming to see White Island – a sandbar with a view of Hibok-Hibok Volcano and Mt. Vulcan.

Fun Fact:
Camiguin is the second-smallest island-province in the Philippines.

Our objective was to trade several kilos of pork which we had previously butchered in exchange for a supply of fresh water. By then we were still a few hundred Kilometers from Culion Island. 

The community of 5 families we stopped at had access to a fresh water spring but would not take any form of currency. 

Looking back now as I write this, that was probably the most raw human experience I ever had having to trade and barter goods at a place where money had no value. 

I can vividly remember the proud look on my girlfriend Hayley’s face as we were sailing away, after she walked away with 5 fresh coconuts in exchange for a bottle of rum. I told her she lost that trade big time.

CCP, Manila

What is it? 
The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) is the premiere showcase of the arts in the country. Founded in 1969 under the Marcos regime, it still continues to hold the most celebrated and award-winning plays from around the world. At night, it's therapeutic to watch the fountain lightshow — a colorful oasis by the side of the main road, in the middle of a busy metro.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
In the main lobby of the National Theater, you'll notice three large Capiz-shell chandeliers hanging from the third-floor ceiling. They symbolize the three main geographical divisions of the Philippines — Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

Rameswaram, the holy island in the Gulf of Mannar, is a major pilgrim centre of the country. 
Rameswaram is hallowed by the epic Ramayana. It is believed that Lord Rama sanctified this place by worshipping Lord Shiva here after the war against Ravana of Sri Lanka. 

Therefore, it is held sacred by both Vishnu and Shiva devotees. It is one of the 12 Jyothirlinga shrines (where Lord Shiva is worshipped as a ‘Lingam (pillar) of light’) of India. A devout Hindu who visits Varanasi in the North must also visit Rameswaram for the culmination of his quest for salvation.

It is located in the central east of Akita Prefecture. The deepest point of the lake is 423.4 meters and shape is almost perfectly circle. However cold the weather can be in winter, the Lake is so deep that it wouldn’t freeze at all.

Let us tell you the myth about this girl “Tatsuko” in the golden statue.
There was a girl, Tatsuko, in the area of Lake Tazawa. Everybody knew she was beautiful and attractive. One day when she realized she truly owns beauty, she started clinging to it. She did not want to lose neither her beauty nor the youth. She wanted them forever that she went to shrine to ask for a help. “Guanyin”(enlightenment being in Buddhism) suggested her to drink water of the lake as much as possible. She kept drinking with suffer, gradually, she turned into “tatsu” (dragon). Since then, she started living in the Lake. Her husband experienced the same thing in the northern lake. He, also in a dragon shape, came to Lake Tazawa, and they have lived together. Having two owners, Lake Tazawa got deeper and deeper.

Vinta Regatta Festival, Zamboanga

What is it like? 
A vinta's sail is made up of vertical stripes of assorted colors that represent the colorful history of the peninsula's Muslim community. About a third of its population is made up of ethnic communities that give the region its unique flavor. These include the Tausugs, Samals, Yakans, Badjaos, and Subanens. Wait until you start hearing the people speak Chabacano – arguably the suavest-sounding dialect because of its heavy Spanish influence.

Fun Fact: 
Vinta is also the name of a Moro dance performed to commemorate the migration of the Filipinos. Dancers imitate the movement of the vintas by balancing on the tops of poles.

With the iconic sight of Hemis Monastery, 47 km from the capital Leh on the west bank of the Indus, under its belt, the place is famous for nine-storey palace built by King Singge Namgyal in the grand tradition of Tibetan architecture. An exceptional destination for adventurous travelers, the area has a wide array of trekking routes too.

The Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary & National Park is situated at the tri-junction of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka on the North Eastern Slopes of the Nilgiris. An erstwhile game reserve, Mudumalai was declared a wildlife sanctuary in the early 1940 by the then Madras Presidency.

With Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Karnataka) in the north, and Wynad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala) in the west the region forms a single, continuous viable habitat for a varied range of wildlife and is a part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. While Mudumalai’s western half receives the southwest monsoon, the eastern tracts receive the relatively gentler north-east monsoon which results in a diversity of vegetation and typical migration of herbivores.

It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

On the first day of September, the Filipino Christmas season unofficially begins. Christmas trees and star-shaped lanterns start to fill the streets. Schools start to put together plays about the birth of Jesus Christ. Christmas remixes of the year's most popular songs start to play on the radio. The whole country is transformed for a solid four months. It's the longest Christmas celebration in the world. And it also has a good claim to being the happiest. 

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
Adults or children form groups and visit homes at night to sing carols. When given change, young carolers typically sing a thank-you song in Filipino that goes, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so kind, thank you!"" When given change money, the song changes to, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so stingy, thank you!""

Mr. Trump,

I try my hardest not to be political.  I’ve refused to interview several of your fellow candidates.  I didn’t want to risk any personal goodwill by appearing to take sides in a contentious election.  I thought: ‘Maybe the timing is not right.’  But I realize now that there is no correct time to oppose violence and prejudice.  The time is always now.  Because along with millions of Americans, I’ve come to realize that opposing you is no longer a political decision.  It is a moral one. 

I’ve watched you retweet racist images.  I’ve watched you retweet racist lies.  I’ve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy.  I’ve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to ‘pay the legal fees’ of those who commit violence on your behalf.  I’ve watched you advocate the use of torture and the murder of terrorists’ families.   I’ve watched you gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.   I’ve watched you compare refugees to ‘snakes,’ and claim that ‘Islam hates us.’  

I am a journalist, Mr. Trump.  And over the last two years I have conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of Muslims, chosen at random, on the streets of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.  I’ve also interviewed hundreds of Syrian and Iraqi refugees across seven different countries.  And I can confirm— the hateful one is you.  

Those of us who have been paying attention will not allow you to rebrand yourself.  You are not a ‘unifier.’  You are not ‘presidential.’  You are not a ‘victim’ of the very anger that you’ve joyfully enflamed for months.  You are a man who has encouraged prejudice and violence in the pursuit of personal power.  And though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are.

Kanchipuram, the golden city of a thousand temples, was once the capital of the Pallava dynasty. It is considered one of the seven sacred cities of India; some of the best temples were built here during the reign of the Pallavas between the 6th and 7th centuries. Subsequently, Kanchipuram also served as an important city of the far-flung empires of the Chola and the Vijayanagara dynasties.

Later, these dynasties too contributed greatly in the temple building activity of this town. 
The city has also been, through the years, a great seat of learning and culture. Adi Sankaracharya established his episcopal seat (Kamakodipeedam) here. Sri Sankaracharya, Appar, Siruthonder and the great Buddhist Bikshu, Bodhidharma, once lived and worked here. Today, it is known not only for temples but also for its hand-woven, silk fabrics.

The temples of Khajuraho are India's unique gift to the world, representing, as they do, a paean to life, to love, to joy, perfect in execution and sublime in expression. Life, in every form and mood, has been captured in stone, testifying not only to the craftsman's artistry but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose rule the temples were conceived and constructed. The Khajuraho temples were built in the short span of a hundred years, from 950-1050 AD in truly inspired burst of creativity. Of the 85 original temples, 22 have survived till today to constitute one of the world's great artistic wonders.
