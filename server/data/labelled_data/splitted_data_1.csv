https://www.facebook.com/travelimagez/videos/vb.195718967444442/255967028086302/?type=2&theaterTime lapse scene of the milky way behind Guyam island, Siargao, Philippines. 

Guyam is a small deserted island of the coast of Siargao near General Luna. The island is visited daily by visitors on a boattrip or who come to just chill out for a while. It's a perfect little island with no facilities exept a toilet and 2 shelters. For a small fee the owner will allow people to stay on the island overnight. I've been in Siargao for over 2 months, the vibe of the island and the beauty of the surrounding islands make Siargao and incredible and addicting island. For a while have I been planning the right time to visit this island during the time when the milky way would be visible ��nd when there would be no light pollution of the moon, also trying to lucky with clear weather. 

The milky is not visible like this with your own eyes, it is because of long exposure shots (20 seconds) that details of the milky way become visible and with postprocessing details and contrast are further enhanced. The settings used are ISO 1600, f2.8, shutterspeed of 20seconds. I used a D800 and 14-24mm lens, but any DSLR can capture this and even a good compact camera with RAW abilities.

(2) The whole of Mindanao is not unsafe and there are equally beautiful touristic destinations one could visit in there such as Siargao, which is becoming a world surf haven; Cagayan de Oro, known for the wild river rafting; Davao, where the Philippines' highest peak, Mt.

1811,67558139928_10153554682914929,"Batik is a technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to whole cloth, or cloth made using this technique. The word of batik is derived from the word ���ambatik�۝ which means ���a cloth with little dots�۝. The suffix ���tik�۝ means ���little dot, drop, point or to make dots�۝. Batik may also originate from the Javanese word ���tritik�۝ which describes a resist process for dying where the patterns are reserved on the textiles by tying and sewing areas prior to dying, similar to tie dye techniques. Another Javanese phase for the mystical experience of making batik is ���mbatik manah�۝ which means �۝drawing a batik design on the earth�۝.

Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting or by printing resist with a copper stamp called a cap. The applied wax itself resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to color selectively by soaking the cloth in the one color, removing the wax with boiling water and repeating the process if multiple colors are desired.

Batik which made in the island of Java has a long history of acculturation, with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures, and is the most developed in terms of pattern, technique and the quality of workmanship. On October 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian Batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. http://ow.ly/RydRE

What is it? 
It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

How to get there: 
Fly into Clark from Incheon, Singapore, or Hong Kong.

Or take a bus from Pasay or Cubao.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

What is it?
The Filipino word for hello is ""have you eaten?"" That gives you an idea of how important food is to the people of the Philippines. Fruits, vegetables, root crops and rice are staples of the Filipino diet. And with water crisscrossing every part of the Philippines, so is fish. A traditional way of preserving them is letting them dry out under the sun. This can give them a shelf life of at least one year.

Fun Fact:
Filipinos love pairing something sweet with something salty. An example of this is eating tuyo (salty, dried fish) with champorado (porridge with cocoa) for breakfast ��� a strange but surprisingly delicious combination!

The people whose lives and livelihood are now dependent on this growing industry in the Philippines called tourism.

Our first story is from @vin_aranas87 (on Instagram) who traveled in May 2015 to Itbayat, #Batanes, the northernmost inhabited island of the Philippines. There, he met their tour guide, Kuya Pepe.

""We met Kuya Pepe on our second day and discussed with him our plans of reaching the #RafangCliffs on the eastern side of #Itbayat. Getting to this place needs some great deal of advice from him as he was the only person allowed to pass through private properties leading to Rafang Cliffs.

""Although he was Marine Engineer by profession, Kuya Pepe chose to stay in the island to be with his family and make a living out of tour-guiding. He explained that being a tour guide has helped him with much of their expenses; he was able to send his kids to school until they finished their studies.

""But aside from the fulfillment he gives his family, he also finds personal joy whenever he sees people enjoying their visit to Itbayat.""

What is it?
Aguinaldo Shrine is the ancestral home of General Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the first Republic of the Philippines. It was from the balcony of this house that the Philippine flag was formally unfurled. Aguinaldo donated his home to the Philippine government in June 12, 1963 ""to perpetuate the spirit of the Philippine Revolution of 1896 that put an end to Spanish colonization of the country.""

Fun Fact:
The Aguinaldo house is filled with antique furniture and decors with the flag motifs, but most interesting are the secret passages and hiding places within the house.

Three months after kicking off 2016 with a social media contest, the Department of Tourism (DOT) announced on Friday, 19 February 2016, the three winners of the photo-fail challenge, each bagging a trip for two back to the Philippines. The contest encouraged foreign visitors to post their best photo-fails taken in the islands, highlighting their fun and candid experiences in the country.

Bannered under the theme ""Visit the Philippines Again 2016,"" this year's tourism campaign aims to attract repeat visitors and new travelers alike to come visit the country and relive the fun experiences they had with their friends, loved ones, and even strangers-turned-friends.

Photo-fail images submitted by Jarne Uytersprot from Belgium, Chintai Kato from Japan, and Kaisa Kapanen from Finland were chosen among thousands who submitted their photos. These photo-fails highlighted off-guard moments of tourists while having fun in the Philippines.

Launched at the World Travel Mart in London, England last November, the social media contest invited foreign passport holders who have been to the Philippines to upload their own photo-fail versions on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook with the official hashtag #visitphilippinesagain2016. Winners of the contest will get a chance to re-do their photos taken in some of the top vacation destinations in the country.

""This social media campaign was our way to heighten up the excitement for big events lined up for the Philippines this year. 2016 is the year of 'again' and 'Visit the Philippines Again' will once more highlight the country as a multi-level experience destination filled with exciting activities and endless new discoveries, shared with their warm and fun-loving hosts, the Filipino people,"" says Tourism Secretary Ramon R. Jimenez, Jr.

Among the big events lined up this year are the Routes Asia 2016, Madrid Fusion Manila 2016, Flavors of the Philippines, Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2016, 2016 Ironman 70.3 Asia Pacific Championship, MTV Music Evolution 2016, the World Street Food Congress, and the Travel Blog Exchange (TBEX).
