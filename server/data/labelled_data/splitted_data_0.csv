These are the specific names in Kyoto for the profession known as geisha. Maiko is a Geiko in training. Young women serve up to four years on apprenticeship as Maiko. The tradition of covering Maiko's faces with white powder means that they have not yet achieved full status. At some places in Kyoto, you can experience parties or events with Maiko's traditional dance performance, tea ceremony, etc.

We have been informed by MOE that the school actually requires approval from MOE before visiting and we understood the ""enter at your own risk"" sign wrongly. It is that way as it is meant to be open for residents nearby to jog along the driveways and also to provide a shortcut for nearby residents to reach the bus-stop along Braddel Road. Any un-approved visit from MOE by any public would be seen as trespassing and will be prosecuted by Police.

It is also now being guarded by security guards 24 hours daily.

""Last year, I had the chance to travel to Batanes with my friend, and the chance to experience Itbayat was a big tick off my travel bucket list. There we met Nanay Cano, a resident who operates a small lodging house. She is a retired teacher who also used to be a tourism officer in Itbayat.

Carrying one's heavy pack along with the items of the rest of the group throughout the duration of the trek, which could last up to 10 or more hours per day depending on the trail, is something mountain guides and porters are willing to sacrifice for in exchange for a better source of income.

Where majority of our provincial lands' main source of livelihood rest in farming or fishing, most of these guides go back to such labor when they have no group to guide in the mountains.

But being a guide can earn four to five times more than what one can earn from fishing or farming in a day, and that is why they are willing to make the sacrifice and even eager to do so. At night in the campsite, they take shots of local rum, not to get drunk, but to ease their bodies from the pain and protect themselves from the cold. 

With better accessibility to the mountains, locals who lead groups visiting as guides or as porters, certainly have a better chance of living, and more money to feed their families.

We shouldn't take it against them for making a decent living out of being a guide or a porter. While there are those local communities who sadly and unfortunately abuse this opportunity, there are still those who do not and are very adamant about providing job opportunities for the locals while at the same time preserving the natural habitat of the mountains in their community.

From among these are the guides I met in Kanlaon Volcano in Negros. They limit climbers to 10 per day and require permits for any mountaineer visiting. They uphold the model for responsible mountaineering.

Apo Island, Negros Oriental

What is it?
Both a volcanic island and a marine reserve, this island has become a favorite diving destination in the southern Philippines. Its most popular site is Coconut, where sea turtles and sea snakes are regulars. But the spotlight belongs to the small-bodied white tip reef sharks which only grow up to five feet long.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Dumaguete.

Or take a bus from Cebu to Oslob, then take the Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry to Dumaguete.

Then take a bus from Dumaguete to Zamboanguita, and transfer to an outrigger boat to take you to Apo Island.

If you fancy corals, you‚Äôll love this place. Most of the country‚Äôs 400+ species can be found in this small space.

Inextricably linked with the history of Sikhism, Amritsar is amongst the most revered sites of the world. It was founded as recently as the 16th century. Its name is a derivative of the Amrit Sarovar (pool of nectar) amidst which stands the Golden Temple, the most sacred of Sikh shrines. Accounts suggest that Guru Amardas purchased the land from Emperor Akbar and decided to build a tank at the site. Following his death, it was completed by Guru Ramdas and also came to be known as Chak Ramdas or Guru ka Chak. Some of the oldest markets in Amritsar, notably Guru ka Bazaar, date back to his time. The construction of the Golden Temple was initiated by Guru Arjan Dev while Guru Hargobind, who accorded the religion a martial temper, built the Akal Takht in 1606. Amritsar has a rich history encompassing various mythical and historical narratives including the epic Ramayana. It is believed that the site called Ram Tirath was Maharish Valmiki‚Äôs ashram, where Sita reportedly gave birth to her twin sons, Luv and Kush. The Gobindgarh Fort and Ram Bagh were built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire. While the Jallianwala Bagh continues to be the most evocative monument to India‚Äôs freedom struggle. The Khalsa College, established by visionary leaders at the beginning of the 20th century turned Amritsar into a hub of education. Also a centre of thriving industry since its inception, Amritsar is famed for its textiles, particularly shawls, and for its carpets. Amritsar has gained tremendous popularity for its gourmet traditions; especially the dhabas (roadside eatery) that churn out, amongst an inexhaustible list of delicacies, irresistible kulchas, chola-bhaturas, tandoori chicken and fried fish. Amritsar has all the makings of a well-rounded tourist destination; its ancient legends, historical monuments, places of worship, old bazaars, theatre traditions and colourful festivals all serve as a window to its robust past. Excursions to the Harike Bird Sanctuary and visits to the India-Pakistan border at Wagah are an absolute delight, while breaking bread or celebrating Diwali with the denizens of this hospitable city is without parallel.(Courtesy Punjab Tourism) ",,Timeline Photos

The Philippines isn‚Äôt a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 ‚Äî known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It‚Äôs only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They‚Äôve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact:
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Here's something different for our readers. In Singapore, most of us go through our lives like drones, getting all our ""skills"" from textbooks. But we never pay attention to the skills that will truly help us in life. The ones that matter. Like making new friends, building relationships and pushing ourselves off that ledge of comfort that we desperately cling on to. We fear the unknown and unfamiliar.

So where do you start? That's why we decided to write this guide.

Go out there and start talking to people. Rake up some smiles, meet your new business partner, talk to that cute boy/girl in line, find out about a cool new bar and so much more.

Tubbataha Reef is a natural marine park that's considered as the global center of marine biodiversity. UNESCO has declared it a World Heritage Site, and in 1999 the Ramsar Convention in Iran listed it as one of the ""wetlands of international importance."" Explorations in the area have revealed that the park has no less than 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 11 species of shark, 13 species of whale and dolphin and even 100 species of bird. It is also the nesting grounds of green sea turtles and critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles. CNN Travel named it as one of the best dive sites in the world.

Tubbataha is isolated, and can only be visited on a liveboard boat. There are no settlements on the islets in the area. Divers who want to visit and have an unforgettable experience must book in advance.

Mount Abu is situated at the southern tip of the Aravali range, the hill retreat owes its cool climate to its rich flora covering the entire hillside that includes coniferous trees and flowering shrubs. During the period of the Maharajas, it was used as a place of leisure by the royalties. The place presents an interesting contrast of British style bungalows and holiday lodges with various tribal communities residing amidst the thick lush forest on the hills surrounding the region.
