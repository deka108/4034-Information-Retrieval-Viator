It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

Among those who benefit from the earnings generated by Tourism are locals from touristic destinations who derive livelihood from it. Take the case of Kuya Eran Decena whose story is told by Cyrus John Malonzo (@the_boy_who_leaves on Instagram). 

""During my 2nd trip to #Coron, I met Kuya Eran Decena, who happens to be one of the well-known tour guides in town. He was famous that he was even featured on travel publication, Lonely Planet.

""My interaction with him indeed proved why he was well-known. First, he is very engaging and funny; there was no dull moment as we travelled from one island to the next. Second, he knows a lot about Coron, from affordable boat rides and accommodations to various detours for delicious local delicacies. And third, you can feel his love for his hometown, especially when he shared his efforts during the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda in Coron, as well as his concerns about commercial developments that pose threats on the island's pristine beauty.

""He said that when he started as a tour guide 15 years ago, there was only a handful of European foreigners visiting Coron. But with more flights and ferries leading to their town, the influx of local tourists has helped sustain their means of living. 

""He used to live in Manila and worked as a messenger for a multinational company before deciding to become a tour guide. I felt that he made the right decision because he is enjoying his job. He even promotes scenic photos of Coron on his own Facebook page. And I sincerely hope that when I get the chance to visit Coron again, he will still sport the same smile that we saw from him two years ago.""

Meghalaya is bounded on the north and east by the state of Assam and on the south and west by Bangladesh. The word ""Meghalaya"" literally means the Abode of Clouds in Sanskrit. The state is inhabited by three ethnic communities -- the Khasis, the Jaintias and the Garos – each of which follows its own cultural traditions and customs. The common trait binding all three communities is its matrilineal system in which the family linage is taken from the mother's side. The people of Meghalaya are known to be hospitable, cheerful and friendly. The state’s area is divided in Khasi hills, Jaintia hills and Garo hills. The forests of Meghalaya are notable for their biodiversity of flora and fauna.

This thought has always intrigued me, mostly because of the sense of appreciation for each. When it comes to experiences, we tend to only understand their importance in the long run. In the moment, we can of course enjoy them. However we may not be able to fully absorb their effect on us until much later on. On the other hand, materialistic belongings have their biggest value when first acquired. Like your mobile phone, for instance. The prized possession you couldn't take your eyes off of the day you brought it home, but has since become just another thing you have, and use. This is what propelled me to start traveling this past year, and I haven't looked back.

""As a filmmaker, photographer and avid traveler, I aspire to inspire through my work, both from my home base in the U.S. and around the globe.

The Bandhavgarh National Park, lying in the heart of the Vindhya Mountain Range in Central India, is a small and compact National Park, yet full of game. The density of the tiger population at Bandhavgarh is the highest known in India. 
The centre of the park is dominated by the majestic Bandhavgarh Fort built in the 14th century, around which are numerous caves containing shrines and ancient Sanskrit inscriptions. The park has four main entrances, Panpatha in the north, Tala in the east (most of the hotels are located in Tala), Dhamokar in the south-west and Khitauli in the west. Two roads, Umaria-Rewa highway and Parasi-Katni road via Khitauli pass through the park. Tala is a small village on the Umaria-Rewa state highway. 

The Original home of all the white tigers alive, today, Bandhavgarh was the hunting ground of the Maharajas of Rewa; their old fort still dominates a hill in the forest. These white tigers were found in the old state of Rewa for many years. The last known tiger was captured by Maharaja Martand Singh in 1951. The White Tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharaja of Rewa.

It's that time of the year again where you look at school rankings that try not to have rankings but fail because everyone just looks at rankings and if there isn't an official ranking, people will make one up and the one that makes the most sense would become the unofficial, official ranking.

""Good"" is a relative position on a spectrum. For there to be ""Good"" schools, there have to be ""Bad"" schools too. That being said, academic results alone do not determine a ""good"" school. There are many other factors like environment, suitability, quality of staff, location etc. But certainly, some schools are better then others. And what's a ""Good school"" to you may be ""Bad"" to another.

Good luck everyone in picking the best school for YOU.

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

#bestyeyeintheworldI am still recovering from a massive sobbing fit as I type this, so do pardon me if there are any typos or grammatical errors. This year, my family's CNY reunion dinner went completely beyond my expectaitions.

Last August I came out to Mum and Dad, and was promptly kicked out. I had prepared for the worst, though, and moved in with a friend. So all went well, more or less, except for me being somewhat depressed and withdrawn. I was not expecting to be called back for the reunion this year.

Enter my maternal grandfather, Ye Ye, a.k.a. The Colonel. He retired from the Malaysian army as a colonel, and is still much respected in the family. The fact that he takes no crap from anyone probably helped that. I was about to go for a drink (alone) for my CNY eve, when he called me. What follows is a rough outline of what he said:

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

Ye Ye himself was at the dinner table, and stood up when he saw me. What he said right then still rings in my ears.

""This is XXXX. My grandson. Some of you think he is not fit to be part of this family home simply because he is attracted to men instead of women. Shame on you! If he leaves, I will too, and FUCK anyone who dares to tell me otherwise!""

The whole house went quiet, and Ye Ye told me to come over and have some food. I was in tears by then, and he told me not to cry, and that he was sorry for not doing anything earlier (according to him no one told him anything until the afternoon, whe=n he noticed me missing from my usual spot chopping vegetables). Dinner was a silent affair, but he did ask me a lot of questions about how I'd been, whether I was happy, so on.

After dinner, I went to see him in his room, and cried. I knelt down and asked for forgiveness for not continuing his family line and for having brought any shame to him. But this man, my grandfather, a military veteran, just told me that it was fine, and that I had done no wrong. That I had been enough of a man to speak the truth, and that by doing so, he was more proud of me than if I had chosen to live a double life. He did admit to some disappointment that he wouldn't get any great grandchildren from me, but in his words, 'some things in life are not meant to be'.

God bless you Ye Ye.

Visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a unique and exhilarating experience. Spectacular scenery, white sandy beaches and swaying palms combine with monuments and museums, world-class diving, swimming and sun basking make this a truly out-of-the-world experience. 

The Archipelago contains 362 volcanic islands scattered in the Bay of Bengal, with only 37 of these being inhabited. These lush green islands have colourful historical past, with strings of invasions by the French, Dutch, Japanese and British and wars between settlers and the native tribes. The Cellular Jail, where hundreds of Indian revolutionaries were imprisoned during the Indian freedom struggle, still stands tall. 

Descendents of these political prisoners and the local tribes of the area are the inhabitants of modern day Andaman and Nicobar. The tropical rain forests that loom close to the seashore are home to unique species of birds, and to tribes that still haven't learned to use fire.

Celebrations are carried out on November 15th for boys who reach the age of 3 or 5, or for girls who turn 3 or 7 years old.

Since Nov. 15th is not a national holiday, many people visit the shrine on near weekend.

Until now, it was necessary to perform the tax-free procedure each time for every one store visited. But in the new system, tax-free procedure can be combined with the goods purchased in multiple stores, such as within shopping streets.

Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5, 001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10, 001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district. 

It would be a pleasure to introduce Okayama City as the first shopping spot in Japan where you will have this new Tax-free system benefit.
At the tax-free stores in Omotemachi Shopping Street and Romantic-dori Shopping Street, you may purchase Japanese traditional sweets, tea utensils or Japanese tea, and then operating procedure tax refund at the tax-free counter of Tenmaya department store. You will be able to get the benefit and also you may enjoy authentic Japanese Tea in your home country.

Okayama is absolutely nice place to visit, where you can enjoy not only shopping but other beautiful attractions as well.

Olu Deniz, a beautiful inland bay that stretches behind the cape, is now closed to yachts. The reason this heavenly place is called Olu deniz (""Sea of the Dead"") is attributed to the following legend;

Once a father and son were caught in a storm here and were in danger of sinking. The son claimed that if they approached the rocks ashore they could take shelter in a cove. The father on the other hand asserted that their ship would be driven onto the rocks and break up and that there were no coves around here anyway. In his terror of running around on the rocks, the father knocked his son (who was at the helm) into the sea with an oar and took over the helm himself. Just as the ship was about to hit the rocks on the cape, she turned into this calm, smooth watered bay. 

This is the reason they say the bay is called the Sea of the Dead, whereas what with the pine clad sandy beach stretched out like a tongue, the name ""Paradise Bay"" would be more fitting.

The Blue Lagoon of Olu deniz has calm, crytal clear waters which makes it ideal for a variety of water sports and a very safe place for children to swim. Part of the lagoon is now a protected area (and it`s a national park).
