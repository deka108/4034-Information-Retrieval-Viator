Boracay, Aklan

How to Get There:
Fly from Manila to Caticlan. 

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan. 

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.

What is it like?
When packing your bags for Boracay Island, shoes should be the least of your concerns. You'll be walking barefoot on the powder-fine sand most of the time. And sitting on it. And getting massages on it. You'll form quite an attachment to Boracay sand. Just please don't take any of it home! Leave the beach for others to enjoy.

Fun Fact:
Come dusk, young boys and girls take to the beach to begin sculpting impressive pieces of sand art. For a small fee, they can even personalize the sand art for you!

It's definitely sth worth celebrating as this day didn't come easy. However, we aren't planning to go fancy restaurant or what not as we're saving up for our wedding day on 16/10/16.

So you pull up lists of programs on GoAbroad and browse through each listing, lookin...","I don't want to break the good vibes but this is just an observation. Some Pinoys act snobbish because they know English...lots of them students, professionals, celebrities...they are so proud that they can speak English that they almost ignored using their own languages...

We confined our native languages to farm life, poverty. But for 2nd languages like English and Tagalog (for non-Tagalogs) we use them when talking about pop, progress, industry, personal and social advancement.

We are killing the dignity and life of our own languages.$$Love my country 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 proud filipino!!$$All Filipino people are so nice!i!I ve been considering to move there because (look at the photo)$$Proud to be filipino$$Beautiful country friendly respectful people you are the best phillipines !!$$And the Pinoy men are hot$$Many Filipinos I know tell me I am the only Pinoy they know who speaks proudly and enthusiastically of the Philippines. They say, it is hot and humid; dirty and polluted; holdups, robberies, kidnapping, pickpockets, and corruption are pervasive everywhere. Why do you still speak proudly and enthusiastically of the Philippines? 

I respond, because of the Filipino people (proudly to be one of them!)! Because of our natural assets notably Vigan, rice terraces, Sagada, Mt. Ma(ga)yon, Palawan, Bohol, Cebu, CDO, also Baguio raisin bread, Albay's pinangat, Iriga's ginataang laing, Cebu's BBQ, just to name a few. And of course the positive changes such as Pinoys are now more health conscious (biking, running, hiking, and mountaineering) more concerned of the environment (recycling, trash clean-up, sanitation), and they are now intolerant of corruption. 

All these are evident in places where, if you don't know you're in the Philippines, you would think you're in nice European or US cities where it is safe to walk around, fun to window shop, definitely a gastronomical delightful to wine and dine, or experience a 4D-movie in a 4DX theater! Whoaa??? A 4DX theater in a Third World Country? There's not even one here in San Diego, CA! Positive and wonderful changes to the people and places compared to many decades ago. 

Why I speak proudly and enthusiastically of the Philippines? Do you have the time to listen?$$Yes, let's love our own naman! There are many positive things and blessings to be thankful for! Besides, as a matter of speech pattern--we truthfully can acknowledge 'those areas that need improvement=the negatives""...without sounding HOPELESS! There is always a ""way to solve problems/ improve the situation'--if only we sincerely put our minds and hearts to it!$$You only need one reason. I am in the Philippines right now and it's rainy season here in Palawan.....it's the people who are the most wonderful you could wish to meet ;) Right Aileen Turqueza?$$When I was still in the Philppines, I thought my country was bad enough to leave it behind. But then when I stayed and work here in the U.S for 5 yrs. I have a change of view and opinion about the Philippines and the U.S. You see I work here with one of the biggest retail store in America or maybe in whole world...I can't help myself to compare about the people here shopping and their behavior.  I've never seen such numbers of shoplifters here stealing everything from a 50 cent to 1000$ items. Some of the customers,if not all but Majority of them are so unruly and disrespectful, they open everything here even thightly sealed items and then just leave it behind in a mess. In short at the end of the day the store looked as if a twister have ran over it,total chaos. And this one makes me think that we behave more and we have more respect more than this people here. Saka sa maniwala kayo o sa hindi ang daming bobo dito! Moral lesson,don't you ever believed 100% in those hollywood movies that you watched about the way of living here, its not that true,it's totally different here in reality than in the movies. Some people here are too proud of themselves, they show too much superiority complex but when you closely look at it they were inferior.

Anilao, Batangas

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Batangas from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
The town of Anilao may not have white sand beaches, but its underwater environment is its biggest attraction. Dubbed as the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines, its deep waters teem with marine life and an abundance of corals and reefs. For non-divers – the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

Fun Fact:
Diving conditions in Anilao are ideal for divers of all experience levels. The water temperature is consistently warm, and the surface is typically calm and smooth throughout the year.

Oftentimes, visitors get trapped in malls or in the four walls of their hotels and go home missing the real Cebu experience. The beauty of Cebu is far beyond what Cebu City is. The pristine beaches are a bus-ride away and some require crossing the seas to nearby islands. The luxury resorts in Metro Cebu may offer comfort but adventure is beyond the city. I think this is what makes Cebu an all-around island. It caters to any type of traveler - shiny malls for shopping, a vibrant night life for any type of party-goer, high-end resorts for those who have more to spend for picturesque selfies, highland adventure for those who want to take risks, crystal clear waters for the beach bums, spiritual journey to those who need some boost of faith, challenging mountains to conquer, a diverse marine life and more than anything a people ready to welcome any type of traveler from the world all over. All these in one island set Cebu apart from the rest.

                                   “All For Unity, All For Peace”   
                         By: Gerard Vincent Macasaet Dimaano   

I.
The world we live in, has become a battlefield, 
Between the innocent and the evil.
The people we love, becomes a slave no one heals,
Because of the dreadfulness that tempts them to kill.

II.
Innocent lives have been taken to oblivion,
The people behind this may not feel the frustrations.
Of their families, friends, and their children's children,
Making this a dark and sorrowful world we live in.

III.
After years and years of sorrow and pain,
It's our time that peace and unity should be maintained.
Let us hold hand-in-hand to eliminate all evilness,
Until our world becomes a planet of happiness.

IV.
Let us shout for freedom, unity, and peace,
Our God looks at our world with hope and ease.
One day, all sources of evil shall vanish before our eyes,
Making the planet we live in, peaceful and unified.

From a french citizen and proud pinoy.$$The people of Mindanao have suffered with what the people if Paris lived with for one day for the last 10 years plus Paris should fly the Philippines flag.$$This is a fitting reminder to note that Dr. Jose Rizal as well as other Filipino Patriots were Freemasons. Rizal became also a member of the Grand Orient (the equivalent of a Grand Lodge today) of France as per available historical records. Thus, if our national heroes were inspired by the masonic principles of ""Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"" way back then, so was France during the French Revolution. I am sure that ""Kuyang Dimas Alang or Dimasalang"" - the masonic name of Jose Rizal which was customary during the time wouldn't mind having his monument be draped in the national colors of France. May ""Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"" triumph over religious fanaticism & ignorance once more.$$We stand for world peace!

I love my country, France, with all my heart.  I fell in love with your country, Philippines, with your culture and with your citizens, but this temoignge of sympathy make me uncomfortable. France would make it the same thing for you? Has she already made it in past? But again thank you!$$doesnt necessarily mean that you change your facebook pic into the tri color french flag therefore you remain deaf to the cry of the rest of the world,
otherwise using that kind of logic means that we are merely depending on the numbers of casualties and not the problem itself,
you might suggest turkish, afghan, iraqi, syrian flag and other african nations as an alternative,
its not about the french craze or western imperialism that we do so, rather it is the fact that those people are also victims of senseless killing and we cannot just accept any feasible reason to justify that.
my profile pic is not in question in here,  so long as your sentiments and prayers goes to the victims and you do not tolerate those acts is actually the point,
and you are one with the world in agony of condemning terrorist of murdering people in the name of an alien principle which is not human at all,
in fact how many billion dollars was and is presently donated to the syrian civil war victims - the world knows exactly what we are facing today
even world leaders are quick to respond just by the picture of the toddlers dead body on the shore
even Germany the mastermind of genocide of jews are welcoming these refugee is now doing the exact opposite.

you do not sympathize in regards to killing as to the number of victims,
this is not a poll related matters or survey,
its like saying, since turkish bombing provides greater casualties therefore turkish flag is better and because paris attacks recorded only a 100+ death toll maybe we have to used the french flag next week or next month,
does it makes sense?
otherwise if we subscribe to that kind of mentality then we are literally moving backward.

cguro kung uso na yung fb nung 9/11 cguro nagkulay america na ung fb not because of its superiority among nations but simply because those acts of terrors are really out of reasons!! its not human!!!
and that sentiments is shared among nations regardless of status and not just by a marginalized group.$$i admire , the Filipino people.

Contest ends on 14 February 2017, not 2016!$$We don't visit science centre as we are staying in the east which will take us 1 hour of train ride to get there. However, we don't mind to spend our 2 hours travelling (back and forth) for the South East Asia's  First 8K 3D Resolution Dome Theatre at Omni-Theatre to immerse ourselves in the 360 degree cinematic experience in the space and land of dinosaurs. Would be great if we are able to win one pair of tickets for the new experience!
Liked and shared.$$Despite being a Singaporean, I didn't get a chance to go to the Omni-Theatre, as it is located at the opposite end of me, i stay in Tampines, therefore seldom travel to the other side of Singapore. Will appreciate if i can win it, get to enjoy a different kind of experience.$$I have never been to the or even an alike Omni-Theatre and would like to experience it at least once! Though the Omni-Theatre is at the opposite end of Singapore from me as I live in Tampines, the reason why I want to win is because I would like to finally experience the 360 degree cinematic experience with my best friend as it would be our first time as well!$$I've watched most of the film's in omni theatre, from the galaxy to the ocean one which was the first 3d with specs, to many more nature films. I recall with fond memories when I was young and going to the omni theatre with family. The excitement builds up as I queue to get in so as to get the best seats in the house. Usually I will sit close to the projector in the middle of the room and marvel at how it rotates. The film are short and we will then walk to a room of exhibitions and learn about science , solar system etc. About 7 years ago, I went again and was sadden by how run down the omni was and in an era of digital films, omni is no longer a draw. I look forward to the new revamped omni theatre and bring back it's glory! Please pick me!$$Always remember going to the science centre when I was a child,  but never to the omni theatre! Really hope to win the entry and bring my love one there to experience and enjoy how technology has advanced! Definitely an ideal place for couples and families!!$$The last time i went to the omni theater was when i was in primary school which is about 20 years ago. It was an amazing experience which i have never forgotten till this day.

I really hope i can win this so i am able to bring my daughter and share the wonderful experience with her. 

Thank You TheSmartLocal for having this giveaway!$$It has been such a long time ago that I have stepped into Science Centre (even though I live in the west). If I can have the chance to experience 3D dome theatre, I will be able to ""show off"" to my friends this immersive experience much before them...haha$$it had been quite a while since i last visit the science centre, much less the omni theatre. given a chance, i would like to immense myself with a 360 degree 3D CInematic experience for once and at the same time to see how the science centre had evolve.$$Liked and shared!
I want to win this with Aik Peng because this would be a very cool experience for us as we've never tried something like that before. Also, this can be a date for us. And its super near and convenient for us! 😬$$My last trip to omni theater was donkey years ago. I heard tat so much have changed & more exciting stuffs to see now. Hope to win so i can bring my son to experience it. Thanks for the giveaway!$$I hope to win a pair of tickets and bring my 2 children to enjoy this wonderful experience at the Omni Theater. 

As the price of one ticket is quite steep. The win can definitely make a difference.

I hope to visit it with him.I love you Mohamed Haji Ismail when you remember all my good points after a fight and take care of me in times of need.As a husband and wife living together for years, differences and arguments are unavoidable. you always try to calm me down and solve the issues gradually because of your love for me. This helps to strengthen our marriage and bond the family. I hope we will win this to immerse ourself in a 360 degree cinematic experience filled with flying spaceships and terrifying dinosaurs in the 23 meter wide dome screen in super high quality in both 2D & 3D formats! Liked & Shared Farida Begum Mohamed Ellias$$In my vague memory, the first movie I've ever watched at the Omni-Theatre was Beauty and the Beast, back when I was just a kindergartener. I'm really glad it's still alive and in an improved form, and it'd be lovely to visit it again with my 'Beast' / husband$$My favourite place since young. Alway feel like I was in outer space when visiting the Science Centre. Especially the omni threatre, I feel like I was travelling on a spaceship. Hope I am able to win this ""space"" ticket to immense myself  in this ultimate experience.$$Although I stay near science centre,  but I only went omni-theatre once..  N that 13 years ago.  Hope I can go again to experience the new 8k 3d resolution dome theatre with my family members!!

http://visitph2015.com/ ","Where exactly in Quirino is     this festival?$$Sorry this message is a bit long winded .                                                                                                                           Quirino is one of those provinces in Luzon that’s still off the tourist radar. Formerly part of Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino became a separate province in 1966. While most provinces in the Philippines are known for something concrete, Quirino’s identity has yet to be formed. It was this air of mystery for an “off-the-beaten path” destination that made me more eager to visit the province. The province is still raw and rugged in terms of facilities, but has a lot to offer in terms of natural attractions and eco-adventures. Nature-tripping and camping, caving, spelunking, trekking, rafting and outdoor sports are just a few of the activities that you can do here. The Sierra Madre mountain range provides a natural barrier on the eastern and southern border of the province and the Mamparang Range on the western part. Right now, it’s only accessible by land from Isabela, but roads are currently being built that will link it to other provinces. There is no airport in Quirino Province. The nearest airport is located in Cauayan, Isabela, which is about 1.5 -2 hours away by land. Several Bus lines (Five Star & Northern Luzon Bus Line) ply the Manila-Quirino route daily while NA Liner and KMS ordinary / aircon ply the Baguio-Quirino route daily. Aircon buses also ply the Manila-Santiago (Isabela route). From the Santiago terminal, you can take a van or jeepney to the different towns: Diffun, Cabarroguis, Aglipay and Madela, from where you can transfer to Nagtipunan. If you’re in a big group, rugged vehicles like jeepneys are the best way to access the mountainous areas that are the jump off points for tourist sights. The rugged roads and dirt tracks in mountainous areas are actually great for Motocross riders and mountain bIkers. There are no private motorcycle or bicycle rentals available yet in Quirino, but some groups are planning to offer this in the near future to cater to tourists. There’s currently a wakeboarding park and hotel being constructed in town. Expected completion is March 2015. The Motocross Cup held every June, in celebration of the Governor’s birthday, draws in thousands of motocross enthusiasts from around the country. Governor’s Rapids, a tributary of the mighty Cagayan River, is famous for its limestone formations. According to locals, there’s a waterfall inside a cave that you can only reach by riding a boat here. A 37-chamber cave system ideal for spelunking, with 8 chambers developed for caving for enthusiasts of different levels of ability. About 80 percent of the total land area of Quirino is covered by mountains and highlands. We got to enjoy a great view of the countryside while toploading on a jeepney on our way to Nagtipunan. The town of Nagtipunan, where the Cagayan River cuts across, is ideal for camping and eco-tourism activities including rock climbing, trekking, swimming, boating, rafting, excursions and fishing, among others. Capitol Plaza Hotel & Restaurant in Cabarroguis, the capital of Quirino, offers comfortable rooms for business and leisure travelers. It’s the largest hotel in the province, has a decent restaurant and large swimming pool, making it popular for local events.

Gundaway, Cabarrogquis, Quirino                                  There aren’t a lot of big restaurants in Quirino, but there are several eateries serving specialties of the Cagayan Valley region                              Ilokano cuisine seems very popular, including dishes like dinakdakan (an appetizer made of grilled pig’s parts blended with pig’s brain or mayonnaise) and igado (a meat dish made from strips of meat and other internal organs such as kidney, heart, and intestine).     One of the more unique food finds was Royal Tubikoy, a combination of tupig, bibibgka and tikoy. The native delicacy made of glutinous rice, coconut pulp, milk, sugar, cheese and shortening is produced by RNB Bukohan and Eatery, Aurora West, Diffun, Quirino. Contact no: 0926-5384956.                                                                 Fossilized flowers are Quirino’s one-town-one-product. While they look ilke dried flowers, fossilized flowers are actually made of alibangbang or butterfly leaves that have been dried, bleached and dyed. You can buy this in the Quirino Pasalubong Center right next to Capitol Plaza Hotel. There’s also a larger showroom and factory in town, where you can buy flowers in bulk. Other products that you can take home for souvenirs include wood carvings, indigenous handcrafted baskets and bags. Food items of interest include mountain rice, Tilanggit (tilapiang danggit), banana chips, polvoron, sampaloc candy, veggie kropek, veggie noodles, and native cakes.            Quirino has two seasons: wet & dry. According to tourism officials, the best time to visit is during the summer months. However, some activities, like caving, river rafting and trekking to waterfalls can be enjoyed all year around, even during the rainy season.

Quirino’s main festival is the Panagdadapun Festival held every September 8-10. The fiesta, which was first celebrated in 1999, showcases the province’s unique culture, convergence of people, and colorful history.
The Aquero Patronal Festival is celebrated every February 14th at the Nuestra Senora de Lourdes Parish, municipality of Aglipay.
Each town has their own respective festival as well.

Thanks for your feedback. These people are representatives from various National Tourism Organizations worldwide, not travel agents.  The program is focused on international exchange and learning from eachother.  

Putting ads in travel magazines is definitely an important part of marketing strategy.  Our company is quite large, and we are mostly focused on online marketing, so I will have to ask around to see what kind of ad campaigns they have in the USA.  What kind of specific aspects of Korea would you like to see featured in such ads?$$I haven't seen a single ad for Korea in any of the travel magazines I've read. As for what kind of ads would appeal to American audiences, different ads focusing on Korea's natural beauty, like its hiking trails and temples (templestay). 
I also think BYJ did a good job with the different tour maps in the back of his book. If he keeps those maps in his English version, that'd be an awesome selling point, too. $$KTO, doing something about Jeju is a most. Is KTO targeting budget travelers who look to spend as little as possible? Or are you targeting women who want to shop? Now that Hawaiian Airlines (very soon) will have direct flights into Korea, you may want to think about what kind of visitor you want?  $$Is there an email address to comment off the wall?

The zip line enables visitors to cross the narrow straits between both islands in about 30 to 40 seconds.

How to Get There:

Fly from Taiwan or Manila to Laoag.

Then take a car or bus to Vigan.

What is it?
Calle (road) Crisologo is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is one of the few Hispanic towns saved from destruction during World War II. Its cobbled stone streets are bustling with touring kalesas (horse-drawn carriage) and vendors selling antiques and hand-woven crafts in front of Spanish colonial ancestral homes.

Fun Fact:

Boracay, Aklan

How to Get There:
Fly from Manila to Caticlan. 

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan. 

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.

What is it?
When packing your bags for Boracay Island, shoes should be the least of your concerns. You'll be walking barefoot on the powder-fine sand most of the time. And sitting on it. And getting massages on it. You'll form quite an attachment to Boracay sand. Just please don't take any of it home! Leave the beach for others to enjoy.

Fun Fact:
Come dusk, young boys and girls take to the beach to begin sculpting impressive pieces of sand art. For a small fee, they can even personalize the sand art for you!

Will be traveling to Seoul to meet my niece for the first time and I was thinking hotel. But with all the wonderful reviews and opinions on hostels, I think I changed my mind. I will also try to incorporate a stay in an hanok. Thanks everyone :)$$3 - guest houses these days are comparable to hotels with sufficient comfort at a good budget...leaves you more pocket for many other activities to do in Korea :)) 

I wish to try 4 someday too.$$I've been to korea 4 times.. I'm prefering hostel because it's cheaper than hotel.. most of the hostel in korea are very clean and comfortable and worth for money.. since i'm a budget traveller.. i'll choose hostel as my fav accomodation most of the time during my stay in korea..😁$$I always look for guesthouses since I travel alone most of the time. The price is quite affordable for people who don't mind small rooms and average cleanliness. You also get to meet new people during your stay~$$I haven't been to Korea , it depends on how much budget you have and where to go . For us who does not have a lot of money , but enough to visit Korea , a good budgeted place is much more affordable for us . Hanok will be good and a good affordable tour guide will be good .. I would love to experience to be living among Koreans , your culture , food , and much more . Thanks 😜$$Definitely hostel, the cheapest and most of the hostel near to public transport station.
I went twice to korea, i hope my 3rd time can be a hanok, wanna try... haha...$$It depends on my budget for the trip ~ but mostly my 1st priority is hostel bcos by staying in the hostel I can meet other travellers. However, occasionally I would like to stay at the hanok to experience the traditional culture of Korea or at the hotel as a reward for my self ^^$$Since I am a budget traveller, I always stay in hostel/guesthouse whenever I travel to Korea. But I also want to try to stay in a hanok if I can find an affordable one near the subway.$$for my 3 times visiting Korea, i stayed at hostel/ guesthouses. much cheaper and its clean. no problem at all. and i am comfortable with the staff :)$$Its depends on the budget. I would like to stay at the hanok house. If i travel with my family, i like everyone stay together.$$We came to Korea last fall and stayed in an AirBnB near Seoul Station. Is was really affordable for 2 people and close to everything! We plan to do it again this fall when we come back.$$I have never been to Korea, but that is in my plan. 
I think, because I love the classic style and history I would choose Hanok. That is beautiful, traditional, there is the soul of the Korean architecture. However I know that is expensive, I would choose it for just a short time period, than move to a hostel. There you can meet with lot of lovely people and that is not expensive, so you can save your money as well.$$For a budget traveller like me and sometimes solo traveller, hostel/guesthouse because it's cheap and I get to know new friends and it feels homey with the local owners/receptionist. I learn more about the culture. Money saved on the accommdation will be splurged on food and shopping. Still on my list on my list is the Hanok stay.$$I have been to Korea twice and have stayed there for a month each.  For a long staying traveller like me, I prefer to stay on a guesthouse considering the budget for accommodation.  I have stayed on guesthouses in Hongdae, Busan, Jeju and PyeongChang and everything was clean and organized.   The owners are very welcoming and helpful.  But I would love to try Hanok someday. Do you have any recommendations on affordable hanok to stay in?  감사합니다.  😊$$For my next trip I'm definitely staying at a Hanok house!!! I love the architectural beauty and simplicity of these houses and I've always wanted to stay in one. My last trip I stayed at an airbnb, I wasn't impressed.$$Hostel/guesthouses because usually it feels as if you are staying with a friends family so you learn more about the local culture. There is more of a personal touch. And Hanok stay also was surprisingly comfortable and a very unique experience. Anyone who visits Korea should try it at least once.$$I have stayed in AirBnB places and have found it much more affordable, especially since I can cook a few meals and do laundry easily. I would love to try a hanok but there is no way I could sleep on the floor.$$For my second  trip to Korea Ihave booked Hostel in the Hongdae area in Seoul as I love this area very much and would  like to meet other people$$Hanok. I always got good price and the experience was perfect. Due to the small size of the Hanok Guesthouses I could create a friendly relationship with the owner, they even acted like being my mother :), by which l could get closer to real Korean life.$$Annyeong KTO teams, i prefer to choose hostel because it's cheaper and affordable for me ... But someday i want to try to stay in a Hanok because it's very unique and beautiful. I want to feel how to stay in Korean traditional house like i usually see in Kdrama. Kamsahamnida 😄$$Hanok and I'd like to try to rent an apartment one day to live the Korean life but I think its so expensive. I'm also following the guest houses news and I think its a good idea too..",0,0,0,4,0,0,accommodation,4,,,,

It represents the very pinnacle of the Kalinga School of Temple Architecture.

Are you able to read and/or write in Hangeul? Share with us! 😊 #KoreanFunFact101 ","Wow! Thank you all  for sharing your own Hangeul learning experience! Indeed, learning to read and write hangeul maybe easier than understanding what they mean as a whole. However, it is still the process of learning that is fun and fruitful.  For VisitKorea fans who are learning the language, don't give up! 파이팅~! :D$$To read and write are easy since you just need to memorize it ~ that's why I can read and write hangeul, but to understand the meaning, it's another problem for me ㅎㅎㅎ I'm still working hard on it$$I learn it from watching some videos uplaoded in you tube. I can read little by little and kdrama also is a big help for me to understand some words and conversation. Happy hanguel day korea.$$I learned how to write and read Hangeul by using an App that I installed from the Google Play Store. At first I was very confused and had a difficult time in learning the vowels on how it sounds and how to pronounce it. And also I had a difficult time in remembering how the vowels and the consonants looks like because some are just the same like the B/P which looks like this, ㅂ . But still I did not gave up learning it. It was difficult at the same time it was fun. And it is also an advantage for me to read/write Hangeul because I'm a K-Pop Fan. Reading/Writing Hangeul is a little bit easier for me but the funny thing is, I can read/write but I cannot understand what it means... But learning Hangeul for me is really fun...$$I love hangeul and learning it for more than a decade now!! Hahah! It's really very unique and it's easy to learn!!! And of course I love and admire the one who created it---- King Sejong!! 진짜짱이다!!!$$I lived and taught in S. Korea from 2002-2006. I got married (to a S. Korean) in Seoul in 2005, and we had our first daughter there in 2006. Sadly, I never learned how to read or write during the four years I was there. We moved back to the U.S. in 2006 and have been back to visit family and friends every 3 years. Last time in Summer of 2014 my wife and our girls went in mid-May and I went (because of work) in mid-June. For that month, I took a few lessons from a Korean neighbor to show up, surprising my wife and her parents with my new Korean reading abilities. It was easy to learn (as everyone says), I sure did surprise them with my reading in the car coming home from the airport, and what's most-- I still kick myself for never learning earlier when I lived there for 4 years!$$I taught myself the alphabets through internet and variety shows and now I can read em in moderate speed and Im constantly learning new words every day and how to use them. The only thing I havent done is learn how to construct sentences properly in Korean but Im getting there. For now I can understand just fine, just to reply back in Korean it takes me a while to do it. Learning Korean is so much fun :)$$I can read and write hangeul.
Though i can understand about 60% in a conversatio, I'm still learning about word meanings. I hope i can continue and improve grammar as well.$$Emmh.. Little bit I can read or write hangul, but I'm not understand the meaning of it (that isn't familiar with) I'm still learn more$$안녕하세요제 이름은 태아 입니타Where I live there are no lessons in Korean,so I'm learning through apps,dramas and songs,I know how to read and write but still so much learning to do$$Yes, I know how to read and write hangoul, and I'm proud of it, the most beautiful language to me$$Suggest every week on FB teach is simple conversation so we feel at home when visitinh Korea
 Thank You!$$we can read and write Hangeul...but we still need to work on our comprehension skills...😊$$Hangul is very easy to learn. Only takes about an hour or so and you have it. Now I can read it.

Or take a boat from Cebu or Tagbilaran to Dumaguete.

Oh and this can be a great birthday present for you! 😙$$This Valentine's Day I will be flying off as it is part of my job. :( although we will be miles, even time zones apart, we will definitely Skype each other and celebrate Valentine's. It doesn't always need to be a grand occasion. As long as i get to see him or be with him, I'm happy. He's a best friend I can't live without and he pulled me through my darkest times. I love him always.$$When the clock strikes 12 tonight (16/01/16), it'd mean yet another milestone in our relationship - a decade. Happy 10th anniversary my love Min Yi Chua! Thank you for being the best boyfriend I can ever wish for, and also my best friend at the same time, for the past 10 years. (Yes, we are childhood lovers since secondary school😄)
I won't say our relationship is a smooth-sailing one, but I am glad we've survived a decade! Cheers to more decades to come! This coming vday will be our 10th vday tgt. It's definitely sth worth celebrating as this day didn't come easy. However, we aren't planning to go fancy restaurant or what not as we're saving up for our wedding day on 16/10/16. Rather, it'd be more of a simple twosome time at my house where I will cook his favourite dishes. Everyday is like vday when I'm with him <3
Hope to get this bracelet to mark this special day for us :)$$Koon Lim this valentine day will be such a special one because i m expecting our baby nuumber 1 and   we get to celebrate with little boy in my tummy  . This year we wont be able to book any restaurant because i know you know my cravings are different all times so on that day we will be like usual couple , dating and shopping for baby stuff and also waiting for the unusual cravings on that day and dine in any restaurant or hawker when food craving hit. What's more we dont celebrate our love just on valentine day . We celebrate almost everyday even when we fight. our love sparks even when conflicts start .

So we decide to share our over-flowing love by helping those that are less fortunate. As much as i want to ask my boyfriend to participate this contest with me to increase the chance of winning, but i decided not to in order to surprise him if i win the contest by sharing our love experience.$$Zhi Wei Lim this valentine's day I'll be the slave driver and ordering you to run errands (which I have not thought of) for our wedding in March 😂😂$$Well, my BF, currently my husband will be my travel mate this coming Valentine's day as we are going away for our honeymoon in Europe!

Overall great article.$$did the sea urchins thing :) did taste nice at that moment :)$$8 Things You Shouldn't Forget To Do When Traveling Around The Philippines.

1. Don't for get to get ripped-off my the Taxi Drivers at the Airports (MNL and Clk mostly.) The same with Trike Drivers at Tourist spots. It may not be much for you. But that amount of money could be as much as some poor guy breaking his back in a rice field.

2. Don't forget the food Totally SUCKS; Caveat the street Chicken or some BBQ.
If you can't make you’re own food there, ask expats where to find decent food.

3. Don't learn the Language; you'll be wasting your time, unless you stay in one place or with a group of friends. There's three different Languages here -- plus English. English is the 'common' language. If you don't know English, learn that one.

4. If you miss home, go to a mall... Half the Malls here are very nice... The other half are like something you'd see in  developed countries 40-years ago.

5. If you make new friends, realize they share an OZ of beer with you, they'd expect 16 OZs in return.

6. 'Keep it Clean.' There's trash and shit all over the place here... but, us foreigners don't really litter anyway.

7. Support the locals, but, not the Tourist Scammers (Taxi, Street People, and whatnot.) You can go to the local Sari-sari (small, rustic, 'convinces' store.) and buy what you can from there. They're regular families working, trying to make a honest living in a place that is difficult to do so. 

8. SMILE... Like many country’s in SE Asia. The here people like you... I think because you are different and come from a different place??? Isn’t that why you like them and are there???

What is it like? 
Soft corals prefer nutrient-rich waters and less light. They may look like plants, but corals are marine animals that need food. And this type feeds on zooplankton, or organisms incapable of swimming against a current – making it the ideal treat for hungry marine creatures. You can find soft corals in Anilao's colorful underwater gardens, which are home to all sorts of tropical fish.

Fun Fact: 
Some soft corals are not actually soft. They're more tree-like and flexible, and can dance gracefully in the waves.

It is located halfway through Panglao along its coast facing the Bohol Sea. It is a sprawling property which covers 16 hectares. The topography of the resort is diverse. It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

Stay in your very own villa for 3 days and 2 nights when you bag #TagTheFun's grand prize! Enter the photo contest now

Please be rational when we need to tell what we think and what we need to the world. Please do not bombard the parties which didn't involve in this disgraceful issue! 

BTW, KTO, I really like Korea but this issue is a true let down...I can accept the boycott of JYJ in other issues (like QTV issue, the members are banned from the music programme, etc...) however an honorary ambrassador on behalf one government are banned from the show? No way - it really looks ridiculous to international world, and it seems to us that: even government can be brought off or need to kneel down in front of the pressure from private sector.$$I love Korea and I like KTO because you are doing a great job to spread Korean love everywhere. But honestly, Korea is lossing respect and love because of the JYJ incident with KBS and Jeju. I think fans just want to raise attention from everywhere so I just posted on your wall ^^. I hope that you wont misunderstand JYJ fans just because of those comments. And it would be great if the problem is solved fairly and the bad ppl are punished$$JYJ incident has been an example of how cruel part of entertainment world and it possibly can happen in other country as well with other actress/or.  We totally understand, the scope of KTO is much wider - it's more than just entertainment world, it's all bout Korea country, the  people and their habits, unique culture, yummy culinary world, and promote the entertainment world as well, as part of the korean wave program.. keep spreading Korea's world to us, i love to hear the updates... btw, like the profpict,been to Carribean bay and Ocean world last year, those are the two of my fave place to challenge my adrenalin$$Thanks for your understanding everyone! It would be nice if the KTO had a little more power when it comes to the entertainment industry, so that we could give our fans a stronger voice. Maybe someday?$$KTO represents a wider scope (Kculture, Kentertainment, etc) but it would be very appreciated if it also has a strong voice. I hope your government will take note that Korea is being promoted heavily through its entertainment industry. And with what happened to JYJ (who was heavily promoting Jeju) , i don't think it a presents a good image of Korea, that it can just drop someone off at a very short unofficial notice. I still hope that this will be rectified asap.$$I like Spaland in Busan...totally amazing!! Really a good treatment after crazily jumping and crying in JYJ Busan Concert :-) Thinking getting back to Busan by end of this year to see the Maple, and of course to visit Spaland again (HEART) 

@KTO Thanks for your feedback as at least we know the messages are well delivered. It would be great if you can gather the comments and pass to the related government officials.

Angono, Rizal

What is it like? 
Water is so central to Angono life that during the town's yearly festival, fishermen hang their catch near the image of the town's patron saint. Of course, St. Clement is also the patron saint of fishermen. Afterwards, the image, the fish and the fishermen get on a large boat and parade down the Angono River.

Fun Fact: 
Angono is also known for its higantes — colorful oversized paper-mache effigies.

I've been a Taylor Swift fan for as long as I could remember. And just imagine wearing a pair of Keds to Taylor's concert! How dope would that be?? Taylor Swift has come so far and I couldn't be more proud. CHOOSE ME CHOOSE ME please :D$$It has been 6 years since I fell in love with Taylor Swift & her music.

Whatever it is, I think Taylor swift can pull any style off, and make them look good!$$I wanna win a pair of Keds because I love Taylor Swift since I was 12 years old.Haha.i really loved her music.my birthday wish for this year is want to see her in real person and will be on her Singapore 1989 world tour concert as well.see you!!!taylor swift!$$Because my friend is a die hard Taylor Swift fan and I want to win this for him!

I love Taylor Swift and every song of hers, in fact will never get sick of any even after her songs have been replayed umpteen times. Didn't get a chance to get the tickets for her concert  though, so I really hope I can get something related to her at least.

Another reason why I love her is because she's tots kind and humble. Taylor's not like any other celebrity. She uses her fame to help fans from around the world with their personal problems, and also did a secret sessions at her place to fulfill the wish of her fans to meet her upfront and to interact with her despite her busy schedule.

He would be soooooo touched when he has it!$$I want to win this pair of Keds Taylor Swift shoes as the moment i saw it at RSH, i really wanted to buy them. Especially the cream coloured ones! All of them had a special guitar pick tag and it was really unique and pretty. I've been a taylor swift fan since Secondary school and i hope i am able to wear these shoes out :)$$I don't really listen to Western music, but once, the radio was playing 'Teardrops on my Guitar' & boy, I was amazed by the unique voice behind the song..I did some research, and found out that it's Taylor Swift! Her music never fails to surprise, from country-style music when she first started, to pop music, Taylor's done it all..her never-say-die attitude was what attracted me to her music too, her perserverence towards her own style of music proofed herself right when she was top on both country charts & the Billboard chart, a feat considered for her young age...she's also able to express herself well through her songs, incorporating her life story and love lines through the marvellous renditions. 
A straight-talker, though she may have personality clashes with some artistes, but that's what I like her for-her freestyle & true spirit, which explains why she has forged great relationships like Ed Sheeran, Selena Gomez & Lorde...

All in all, she's one great & talented young diva fans like me look up to..

Hope to win the shoes & be able to wear it to her concert proudly and shout 'I'm a Swiftie' with fans alike! Hmm maybe try for a chance to get her autograph there too?$$Because Taylor Swift is awesome and I love her! <3 Taylor Swift is love Taylor Swift is life <3$$Because I have never been to a concert before and I admire Taylor Swift's attitude towards music.$$Back in secondary school when I was ""Fifteen"", all the cool kids wear Keds. Either I wasn't cool enough or just poor :-P so I had those $10 white running shoes from the Pasar Malam :-) But I wore them with pride (because they are the only pair I got). Like Taylor Swift's song ""Never Grow Up"", I guess I never grew up and let this experience down. My ""Love Story"" with Keds has not ended yet because Keds, ""You Belong With Me"" :-) I hope I have the ""Last Kiss"" and ""Walk Out of the Woods"" with a new pair of Keds x Taylor Swift from Royal Sporting House Singapore and TheSmartLocal.com. Liked both pages and liked and shared this post. Kristina Ong Dee Kacey Daisy Marian Wong$$Taylor Swift is such a huge role model to me. I love how she loves and appreciates her fans. She has such a big heart  and has donated to charities and visited sick children in hospitals despite her busy schedule. I really admire her when she sings as she puts her heart and soul in her songs. She inspires me through her songs in many ways. Taylor tells stories in songs that I can relate to. It's like flipping through my diary and every single one of her songs has so much meaning to me. Her music totally describes how I feel. Her music has gotten me through my darkest times. She has even inspired me to learn the guitar. It's amazing how I can connect my feelings through her music . I am always inspired by her style when I dress up everyday. I absolutely love her girly sense of style and her line of keds shoes reflects that. Wearing the pair of keds, I can walk on this journey with her. With the keds shoes, I would be able to walk closely with her. It will also serve as a reminder for me to always push through obstacles and chase after my dreams. If I could borrow her style and wear it everyday, I would be overjoyed to the moon and back. It would mean the world to me if I could wear her line of keds shoes everyday. <3$$It would be so awesome and coooool if im able to win Taylor Swift x Keds shoes as i've always want to own a pair of my own.",0,3,1,0,0,0,,,,,,

The first stage. All stages will be three.
The sources of rivers - is washed with water gorge. Between two mountains set 10 baths. Obtain a ladder height of 100 meters. Water flows from the tenth to the ninth bath tub. With nine baths - in the eighth, and so on to the bottom of the bath. From the bottom of the bath water flows in a specially dug the lake - an area 4.3 square kilometers - storage of cold water.
Production of crystal clear enriched in trace elements and chilled fresh water.
The principle of operation of the technology. Know height growth per km, provides cooling of 6.7 degrees. That is, the water bath cools in the tenth to 0.67 degrees, at the bottom - by 0,067, and the average - to 0.335 degrees. How much does it - a lot or a little? - There Are Many. Increase in global temperature of 0.05 degrees. Divide one by the other, and we get the result: technology has reduced the temperature of the inflow of 6.7 times. This is a great indicator. Such technologies on the rivers of the Philippines will need as much as possible - up to 25-30 pieces. They will cool in a month and all the rivers before flowing into the ocean. Rivers will evaporate less moisture, that is, will be replenished.
This technology Philippines can build without me. A month later, you will get positive results, and call me. I will bring more powerful technology, and all the rivers of the Philippines will be restored. It will irrigate arid lands and pastures. Build new farms. And the work will provide tens of thousands of Filipinos.

It’s a ferry ride to Hong Kong Disneyland! Check out the details of Star Ferry's Water tour here: http://bit.ly/2kIZwO0$$This trip is amazing I did it on the 9 th Jan for my 60 th birthday with 6 other friends we did the lunch package which includes the boat crossing and lunch or afternoon tea at the Walt hotel , we went on the 11 am ferry and came back on the 6 pm ferry it takes about an hour each way but there is a bar on board and your ticket includes a drink and snack the trip back is lovely as it dark and you see Hong Kong in its glory , the meal at salts hotel  was very nice and they also made me an amazing birthday cake , you also get access to the Disney transport so we went and had a look around all the hotels ,the cost was approx £40 per person including lunch but just the round trip is about £20 , we were lucky enough to be treated like royalty on the boat as we were the only 7 people on it going out and on the way back there were 4 more people but they were tour guides . Worth doing for a special occasion$$I was in HK a few years back, been  on the star ferry but did not know there was a disney land ?? Is it recent?$$Once in a lifetime experienced Jan 28, 2017 ... its Chinese New Year... from Macau to Hong Kong... and its raining hard when we get there... oh oldies like us can't enjoy the Disney land any more just picture pictures only... happy enough at the gate rather than to pay that much anyway its raining you cant do much walking too inside... do other options back to the malls and do some window shoppings.... happy enough  :-)$$Took my 4 kids here whilst on a busman's holiday 2 years ago, and they loved it, the ferry was great. Disney here is to me just the right size for a day out, but boy was it humid. :) Can't wait to return, neither can the kids.$$We were in Hongkong three times already the last two years ago. We are going again on February 27 for a week tour. Hope the temperature goes up as it is so cold there now.$$Overpriced Disneyland?

Routes Asia is the biggest strategy summit of route planners, gathering airlines, airports, and tourism and aviation officials, to plan their future destinations.

The country's hosting of this prestigious business event will allow the Philippines to showcase our destinations and soon-to-be inaugurated international airports in provincial cities such as Panglao in Bohol, Daraga in Albay, Caticlan and Kalibo in Aklan, and the expanded Clark International Airport and Mactan-Cebu International Airport. Existing international airports such as Manila, Davao, and Iloilo will also get their well-deserved attention.

As soon as these airports are opened, foreign travelers and Filipino workers abroad may now fly straight to their destinations, easing up foot traffic at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila.

Happening at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City from 06 to 08 March 2016, this year's Routes Asia is the biggest summit so far, bringing in 100 airlines, 200 airports, 50 countries, 1000 delegates.

Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and Sicogon Development Corporation (SIDECO) will launch Sicogon Island Tourism Estate development within the first half of 2016.

The ALI-SIDECO joint venture is expected to drive economic progress in Western Visayas and the entire region as it serves as a tourism hub for surrounding or nearby destinations like Gigantes, Bantayan and Concepcion islands.

The 1,100-hectare Sicogon Island will feature a balanced mix of developments, such as a resort town center, hotels and resorts, as well as commercial and residential establishments, supported by an on-site airstrip.  The ground breaking of the airport runway is scheduled for the second half of the year.

“The initial development will concentrate on building the airport and runway, to ensure accessibility to the island,” said Jose Emmanuel Jalandoni, ALI Senior vice president and group head of commercial business.  “The 1.3-kilometer runway will allow immediate access from Manila and Cebu to the island development,” he added, saying further that test flights to Sicogon are being targeted for the first quarter of 2017.

The project is supported by public, private and community organizations, and government bodies alike because of the potential economic benefits it will bring to the region.  A framework agreement was signed by ALI, SIDECO, and the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk Association (FESIFFA) in 2014 to pave the way for the sustainable development of Sicogon Island.  The group has been assisting the local community through skills training and livelihood programs to make them active partners in the development.

“We strongly believe and hope that poverty alleviation will be achieved through tourism projects.  These will give us various job opportunities and help us improve farming and fishing methods,” said Raul Ramos, president of FESIFFA.

Jalandoni stressed that sustainability will be a main focus of the project.  Aside from allocating more than 50% of the development for open green space, ALI will also work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to continue stewardship of Sicogon’s forested area, and work on coastal protection and marine life rehabilitation in support of sustainable development.

“More than becoming a premier tourist destination and a tourism hub for the region, Sicogon is envisioned to provide inclusive growth and economic development through long-term recovery and livelihood programs, and job creation,” said Jalandoni.

ALI estimates that the Sicogon Island development will provide 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly with increased tourism, and approximately P1 billion in earnings for the community through business opportunities that will come from the retail and commercial establishments.

Learn more at www.madridfusionmanila.com ","It's hard to eat such lavish meals in Manila with starving children sleeping on the streets only a block down the road.$$I have one advice to foreigners. NEVER go to the the capital city of Manila. The moment you arrive at the airport, you'll get hussled for money. Once you are outside of the airport, there's a big chance you'll get mugged, conned, stabbed or picked. Theres not much infrastructure for public services, there's extreme poverty in every corner. There's the worst traffic on earth, the worst pollution, the rubbish are strewn everywhere. Beaches are no longer prestine and there are too many people hassling you for money. The police are next to useless, the gov't is unstable, there are protests on a daily basis. There is nothing to see apart from old remnants of past colonizers. Prostitution and drugs are everywhere. The streets are flooded with illegal guns. There's the typhoon every month or every 3 weeks. There's the hot sticky muggy weather that is unbearable and just goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and lasts the whole year. And when your crappy holiday is over, you'll get squeezed out of your last peso at the airport. They have the airport terminal fee and something else.. also in cash! It must be paid in cash. Of course you can see that the cash disappears into thin air because the airport is so dilapidated that it earned the monicker: ""The worst airport in the world"" for 3 straight consecutive years!! So stay away.$$Just like in America ..., there are people with no food and shelter and  living under bridges or on the woods . Poverty is everywhere ..., not just in Philippines$$Dami nyo problema! Advertisement lng po yan..nasa inyo na kung gs2 nyo puntahan yang resto!..the best is cook your own food...hehhehe peace everybody$$Coming to Manila in the month of April 2016 to  analyse and dissect very tasty food and visit beautiful places around$$I thought what she's eating bcoz can't explain her face...its like she's eating a 
very delicious food. But then its just s noodles she's eating...maybe it taste very delicious.$$I think the Philippines should work on reducing the crime there. A friend who's visiting Bohol just got robbed there yesterday.$$And on second thought, no one's going to Manila until it fixes its dangerous image and gun problem. Everytime I go back my mom won't let me leave the house cause there's always some story about a person getting maimed or held for ransom or random people getting shot left and right.

She manage to feel right! 

That's the Philippines!$$Nah.. Its cool. I don't want bullets planted in my luggage and get imprisoned in a 3rd world country where half the children are starving.$$She is eating mindfully!  We all should try to eat like that, but the truths we all have jobs to go back to work on time and no time to be mindful about everything.  Hay, half or an hour lunch break is not even enough time to do anything mindfully. OMG, I don't have time to chew my food mindfully he he he.$$I wish you guys would stop promoting these vids because they are quite stupid.

Dahican Beach, Davao Oriental

What is it like? 
Boracay's four-kilometer stretch not enough for you? Behold this stunning seven-kilometer stretch of white sand, with towering coconut trees as lush accents. Dahican Beach is widely popular beach destination for skimboarding. It's also a place for observing marine life, as dolphins, sea cows and sea turtles inhabit its waters.

Fun Fact: 
Kuya Jun Plaza is a native Dahican and founder of the Amihan Boys – a group of the best skimboarders and surfers in the region. He doesn't only teach them how to get better at their sport, but also gives life lessons on how to stay away from vices and use their passions to help others. Try to meet him and shake his hand when you're in the area.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/tsl-comedy-19Nobody gets hungry like Singaporeans do. In this episode, Keiji gets creative and shows you how we've seen fellow Singaporeans order food at a restaurant!","Congratulations Carina Tan, Kenny Kwek, and Bee Geok on winning this giveaway! A big thank you to everyone who participated. 

If you didn't win this time, you  still have a chance to win dining vouchers from Sumiya Charcoal Grill Izakaya. Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one 😂😂 damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london 😍😍 my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it 😂$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin – Singapore’s 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy! It's the most unforgettable dining moment.$$There's this place where you pick what food you want, and it get delivered to you like a speed train on a conveyor belt after the chef has finished your order.",4,1,0,0,0,0,,,,,,

I am trying to use most of the products made from Korea such as toothpaste and food etc. Places like Apgujeong-dong & Rodeo Street have quite many unique alleys of individual fashion shops and Italian restaurants etc. Myeong-dong is always exciting. Hongik University has many artistic values in this district where I enjoy walking along the little alleys of cafes, small theaters and outdoor festivals etc, youthful energy is very alive. Also I adore the historic parts of Korea where traditional living, culture and architecture are still kept there.

The exhibit runs until December 25th, but right now we don't think there will be any more K-pop stars making appearances. We'll let you know if anything changes, though!$$Winter in Korea occurred in the month of December to early March, now to enjoy the winter in Korea are some pretty interesting places to visit by us. Nami Island or also called Naminara Republic. Located in Bangha-ri, Namsan-myeon, Chuncheon-si originally not an island. This is the island Bukhangang River, which was made as a result of dam construction Cheongpyeong. Circumference is about 6km, and the area is 430,000. There grassplot than 260,000 in the middle of the island. Nami Island is a beautiful and interesting island to visit with family, friends or spouse during the spring and winter. Because in addition to having natural beauty, Nami itself has a sweet romance and memories when we visit there. And that is strengthened by the story of a love story of the drama 'winter sonata'.

You must already know the story korean drama ""Winter Sonata"" which players Bae Yong-jun, Choi Ji-woo and alm. Park Yong-Ha. Winter Sonata is a love story that is able to anesthetize the audience. The story of this drama is about love first has enormous power. Power is capable of uniting the two lovebirds even though many things have become hindrance of their relationship. Almost certainly you'll like the 2002 series is made in Korea. Besides interwoven stories that are packed very beautiful, background paronama winter is very captivating to watch. Nami Island in the drama is created, so Nami Island became world famous.

In addition to Nami Island, Winter in the city of Seoul is also quite interesting to enjoy. Because along the sidewalk in the winter, many vendors sell snacks winter is quite popular as roasted sweet potatoes, roasted chestnut, hoppang kind of steamed bread, and bungeo-ppang fish-shaped bread that is in filled with red bean paste. Although Korea has grown rapidly and is more modern, but traditional snacks are still there and not change and can bring us back to childhood for the ancient Korean society. Winter in Korea is very cold, windy and dry, so this is a nightmare for our skin. Do not forget when you come to Korea during the winter always apply moisturizer to the skin that are not easily dry and wrinkled. Hehehe ......

If a vacation in the winter, not afdol if not try the game skating on the ice at the Everland amusement park is popular in winter. Skiing and snowboarding are the most exciting games in the winter, because it's a lot of visitors who arrive in this Everland. In winter there are also several festivals are held to enliven the winter, like Taebaeksan Snow Festival. This festival is one of the most interesting festivals in the country and popular Korean ginseng and this wave. In addition, tourists can also enjoy a visit there and follow the race to form snow with a gift that was quite interesting. Kite festival in the winter is also quite interesting in Korea. Not to mention the concerts are held in this season, which presents K-pop that has been popular in the world, such as Super Junior, Shinee, Fx, SNSD, Beast, TVQX, Wonder Girl, Big Bang, 2NE1, T-ARA and other other. Well, how do you want to try a visit to the State which will terkanal ginseng, natural beauty, culture, and his K-POP in this winter ??.....C'mon guys visit in the korean.
The ski travel program includes daytime activities such as ski instruction, amateur ski competitions, snowboard competitions, and sledding competitions, while featuring some nighttime events like Korea traditional dance and modern performances. There are also a number of additional special events, discounts and free gifts for visitors.
In the recent years, the number of Southeast Asian tourists for the winter season has increased because of the snow covered mountains and the fun and thrills that are offered at the ski resorts in Korea.

Among those who benefit from the earnings generated by Tourism are locals from touristic destinations who derive livelihood from it. Take the case of Kuya Eran Decena whose story is told by Cyrus John Malonzo (@the_boy_who_leaves on Instagram). 

""During my 2nd trip to #Coron, I met Kuya Eran Decena, who happens to be one of the well-known tour guides in town. He was famous that he was even featured on travel publication, Lonely Planet.

""My interaction with him indeed proved why he was well-known. First, he is very engaging and funny; there was no dull moment as we travelled from one island to the next. Second, he knows a lot about Coron, from affordable boat rides and accommodations to various detours for delicious local delicacies. And third, you can feel his love for his hometown, especially when he shared his efforts during the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda in Coron, as well as his concerns about commercial developments that pose threats on the island's pristine beauty.

""He said that when he started as a tour guide 15 years ago, there was only a handful of European foreigners visiting Coron. But with more flights and ferries leading to their town, the influx of local tourists has helped sustain their means of living. 

""He used to live in Manila and worked as a messenger for a multinational company before deciding to become a tour guide. I felt that he made the right decision because he is enjoying his job. He even promotes scenic photos of Coron on his own Facebook page. And I sincerely hope that when I get the chance to visit Coron again, he will still sport the same smile that we saw from him two years ago.""

Meghalaya is bounded on the north and east by the state of Assam and on the south and west by Bangladesh. The word ""Meghalaya"" literally means the Abode of Clouds in Sanskrit. The state is inhabited by three ethnic communities -- the Khasis, the Jaintias and the Garos – each of which follows its own cultural traditions and customs. The common trait binding all three communities is its matrilineal system in which the family linage is taken from the mother's side. The people of Meghalaya are known to be hospitable, cheerful and friendly. The state’s area is divided in Khasi hills, Jaintia hills and Garo hills. The forests of Meghalaya are notable for their biodiversity of flora and fauna.

The Smart Local Pte Ltd will be offering a prize of SGD $100,000 for anyone who could show under proper observing conditions, evidence of a ""Third Eye"" or any paranormal power for that matter. Have a friend who claims he has powers? Tell them about this challenge!

This challenge will be valid to the end of 2016 and the full terms and conditions of the challenge will be in the participation and filming consent forms. If we get enough participants, we'll be producing a YouTube series where applicants will be given the chance to prove themselves on our YouTube channel.

We were raised to drink our Kopi out of plastic bags; and call every Tom, Dick, and Harry 'Uncle' and 'Auntie' without batting an eyelid; but here are 13 oddities of Singapore life as seen through the eyes of a foreigner.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/living-in-singaporeFrom drinking out of a plastic bag, to generally despising the hot weather: these are some of the weird things that Singaporeans do which us foreigners wouldn't expect!","I moved from the UK to Singapore about 2 months ago. I can relate to most of these, especially point 4!!!$$Very interesting article which I can relate to as my wife is originally from Singapore. However let's not forget about the massive amount of plastic pollution that comes with all the food and drink packaging, as well as plastic bags used. We go back to what I call my second home a lot, and each time we notice the continual disregard for disposal packaging / plastic bags used at food & drink outlets and supermarkets. In this modern day and age we should be more environmentally conscience, and using more decompostable/biodegradable packaging should be the norm! I know this mainly comes down to government policies. Moreover the government does all the recycling for residents; people don't participate in their own waste management thus they do not see the importance of sorting out their rubbish and recycling, unlike countries in Europe and even Japan who are really good with residential recycling. Everyone needs to do their part in helping to reduce land waste as it's one of the most serious threats to our planet. Besides that, Singapore is still a great country to visit.$$I went the other way around ... relocated from Singapore to London last year. It's the same way ...So many things I miss about home, and so many cultural nuances to learn!$$Not just Singapore, in Malaysia it's exactly the same as well. I'm originally from Malaysian and currently studying in Edinburgh and I'm very surprised I've never seen ants and cockroaches here before... which is really odd$$It is good that the foreigners are mixing enough with the locals to even notice these differences. It used to be that ""expats"" kept very much in their own circle of friends, culture n habits, that by the time they leave they hv not much clue about the way of life of the country they had lived in for a while. I had a foreigner friend who thought she was going for a scary adventure when she visited the ""heartland"" and hoped none of her friends saw her doing it. And eating out of plastics,...you got to be kidding.$$Love this. ... thanks for posting. ... we are true blue  Singaporeans. .. !!

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Surigao (one hour), then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a bus from Manila or Davao to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a boat from Manila to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

This time of the month, Filipino Catholics practice the Simbang Gabi (night mass) tradition. For nine straight days, starting on December 16, they wake up as early as 3AM to hear mass. This leads up to Christmas eve, the last day of Simbang Gabi, where the final mass is held. This is known as the Misa de Gallo (rooster's mass).

ilipinos do their best not to miss a single mass during this time, believing that attending all nine will grant one of their wishes.

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University’s Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Best Regards
Yours Cordially

Banaue Rice Terraces, Ifugao

How to Get There:
Take a bus bound for Banaue from Sampaloc.

Or take a bus bound for Baguio from Cubao or Pasay, then transfer to a bus bound for Banaue.

What is it?
The rice terraces cover approximately 10,360 square kilometers of mountainside. This agricultural feat was accomplished largely by hand, with minimal equipment. No wonder Filipinos refer to it as the “Eighth Wonder of the World.”

Fun Fact:
It is said that if you lined up the steps from end to end, they could encircle half the globe!

Pamilacan Island, Bohol

What is it?
This small, beautiful island is just a short boat ride away from the Baclayon pier. It’s famous for dolphin and whale-watching, so time your trip during the months these animals are most active.

Fun Fact:
There are ruins of an ancient Spanish fort on the island.

What is it?
Want a baby? Every year, single men and women and childless couples dance in the streets to seek help from the patron saints of matchmaking and fertility: Sta. Clara, San Pascual de Baylon and the Virgin of Salambao. 

Fun Fact:
Local fishermen and farmers join in the dancing as well but instead of praying for children, they ask for a good harvest! With all the dancing involved, it's almost impossible not to join in yourself, whatever your intentions may be!

Bacolod City, Visayas

How to Get There:
Fly from Manila or Cebu to Bacolod.

Or take a bus from Dumaguete to Bacolod.

Or take a boat from Manila to Bacolod.

What is it?
Known as the Festival of Smiles, Masskara started as a way of uplifting the spirits of the people of Bacolod.

Fun Fact:
Electric Masskara, a three-day portion of the three-week long celebration, is the longest street party in the country.

Yes u have the right on your opinion but i have to contradict that for as i have seen, you're degrading my hometown festival :) 
Special Trivia for you: 
Masskarra means;
mass- came from the english word many, in tagalog Marami..
Karra: came from the spanish word means ""masq"" ""mask"" 

The festival created by the early goverment officials of bacolod, for despite of all crisis in sugar industry and the Don Juan Tragedy kailangan pren ng mga taga bacolod magsaya, because that time halos lahat ng bacolodnon malungkot sa nangyari :)

I really hope to win the glasses for her to choose her favourite stylish glasses from them so to surprise her.$$Liked, followed and shared. Amazed with Owndays' simple price system and approach of owning a spec that matches one's lifestyle, fashion style and personality. Really like the posts on your FB! Been on a search for a pair as my present spec is few years old and couldn't seem to find one that fit my face size that I like. Hope I'll get to win this so that I can look great even as the bespectacled me! P.S.: saw a FB post about the lenses being able to block out the haze? That will be amazing for sensitive eyes.$$Early last year, I started experiencing severe vision blurring after I had stopped using contact lenses due to eye infections, which prevented me from reading books and computer fonts. My friend is an optometrist and she suggested that I let her take a look, turns out to be corneal staining. I had to refrain from contact lenses until it recovers but mine was a rare case and took almost a year to clear. 
I am so used to wearing spectacles now but the disadvantage is that my current pair does not go with all outfits, so I hope to win a pair of trendy glasses from Owndays to have more outfit choices (& maybe snap a hipster shot? ;)).$$What I really hate about wearing glasses is that some are just too heavy & uncomfortable that I often got headache after wearing it for whole day. Hope #Owndays  can help me find the PERFECT PAIR!$$I want to have a pair of spectacles which can highlight my eyes and bring out my personality. P.S. Is there a pair of glasses that can block out the haze? 
Instagram: macaron_macaroon$$I have been wearing this pair of glasses for 3 years and or so I take good care of it but regardless of how careful i am, glasses are bound to get damage by wear and tear overtime as currently i am serving NS and dropping of glasses are bound to happen :(

As you can see both the frames and lens are scratched and it really affects my vision especially at night which i have to deal with light glares and it makes me really uncomfortable!

i've heard of OWNDAYS long ago and been visiting different outlets whenever i chance upon to and i would say their designs i like would cost quite abit and for me as an NSF serving the 2 years in my country would already cost half of my 1 month's pay so i would really appreciate it if OWNDAYS is gives a pair of prescription glasses.

Thank you for taking your time to read this !

13099,240054519398747_1153507558053434,"""I live for the road. Collecting experiences, versus that of materialistic belongings, will always be a goal of mine. This thought has always intrigued me, mostly because of the sense of appreciation for each. When it comes to experiences, we tend to only understand their importance in the long run. In the moment, we can of course enjoy them. However we may not be able to fully absorb their effect on us until much later on. On the other hand, materialistic belongings have their biggest value when first acquired. Like your mobile phone, for instance. The prized possession you couldn't take your eyes off of the day you brought it home, but has since become just another thing you have, and use. This is what propelled me to start traveling this past year, and I haven't looked back.

""As a filmmaker, photographer and avid traveler, I aspire to inspire through my work, both from my home base in the U.S. and around the globe.

""From the electric blue waters and lush palm forests, to the generous and heartwarming locals, there's no place quite like The Philippines. Having the opportunity to travel here and become immersed in its charm is an experience I cherish.""

Planning a family getaway but only got a weekend to spare? Genting Highlands' theme park may have closed, but here's whole list of activities for both the young and old! 

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/visit-gentingPlanning a budget weekend getaway? Genting Highlands' theme park may have closed, but here's a list of activities you can enjoy with your family!","Let's critique the author's points.

2. Price is enough to put anyone off. With The coach price i can even fly to bangkok. And who even enjoys bus rides? Seriously. 

3. I ' ve never really heard anyone giving food as a reason to visit genting. Congrats, you are first

4. WOW! You actually still book hotels based on stars!!! Impressive. Why not look up tripadvisor and marvel at the reviews of this worn down hotel?

5. Really? You prefer to go up the mountains to do that? You mean you can't do that in singapore? Oh MY.

6. Nice, you mention it's cheaper than singapore, but than the whole malaysia is. What you fail to mention is that places like penang and KL are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. Picking at straws already?

7. i'll sponsor you glow sticks, if you actually think bowling in a glow in the dark bowling arena is fun, and worth a trip to genting. 

9. It'll be exciting for five minutes, until you realise you're looking at just trees tres and trees. Have you never been on that cable car?

TLDR; poorly written article, worst i've ever read on travel. Load of lies.$$I've just came back from last weekend genting trip...can't say I don't enjoy because I did especially when you're with the best people, it doesn't really matter where u go.. 

The food nope..I could only count two good enough place to eat and the others are just fast-food if you're okay with it.

We played arcade for fun and karaoke and just bask in the cool air.

The only buffet we had was  coffee terrace but I saw one big cockroach over there near the coffee and tea. Enough to put me off that station. But the other food spreads are good enough,thank god.

The customer service over there have dramatically declined. SERIOUSLY. Plus, check-in time at 3pm. And if you are to check in at the counter, there's a charge and if you were to check in early,there's also a charge. Plus, pay your precious wifi and can only use at the lobby. Just go starbucks people and chill and get ur coffee and wifi there. 

Other than that, I will still go Genting just for a short vacation with family or friends. My best holiday place is Bangkok still though, first on my list. 👍$$1 reason not to visit for now.  Theme park is renovating .$$""Heck, that can barely buy you a happy meal in Singapore."" - Darren Wee",0,0,0,0,2,0,,,,,,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bandhavgarh National Park, lying in the heart of the Vindhya Mountain Range in Central India, is a small and compact National Park, yet full of game. The density of the tiger population at Bandhavgarh is the highest known in India. 
The centre of the park is dominated by the majestic Bandhavgarh Fort built in the 14th century, around which are numerous caves containing shrines and ancient Sanskrit inscriptions. The park has four main entrances, Panpatha in the north, Tala in the east (most of the hotels are located in Tala), Dhamokar in the south-west and Khitauli in the west. Two roads, Umaria-Rewa highway and Parasi-Katni road via Khitauli pass through the park. Tala is a small village on the Umaria-Rewa state highway. 

The Original home of all the white tigers alive, today, Bandhavgarh was the hunting ground of the Maharajas of Rewa; their old fort still dominates a hill in the forest. These white tigers were found in the old state of Rewa for many years. The last known tiger was captured by Maharaja Martand Singh in 1951. The White Tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharaja of Rewa.

But sometimes i can go overboard when I am gyming and eating especially dessert. So hope this fitness tracker can help me count my workout routine to balance out my diet. Hope to win. Thank you$$Liked and shared! We need to keep track of our diet & calories count because we are always indulging in good food & desserts without having enough exercise.

Moreover, Misfit Shine 2 doesn't sit on your wrist, but gets clipped on your clothing - It's so simple!$$Liked and shared
I now know things that I was oblivious to before. Ignorance was bliss. These desserts look so beautiful previously.  Now all I see are numbers when I look at them. Gotta have my Misfit Shine 2 so I could balance my in and outtake of calories so I can once again look at these desserts they way I used to.$$I'm probably the least fit around. My idea of exercise is walking my dogs or Pokemon-ing. Hahaha. Winning the Misfit watch would help keep tabs on my activities, and maybe make me more conscious on moving more.$$Liked and shared! Hopeful to win because I haven't found a fitness tracker that's versatile enough for different occasions until this. And I've been thinking of getting one to monitor my sleep due to my shift work. Plus it's gonna motivate me to move around more to increase my activity level since work is office based and I've been procrastinating on exercising.$$Liked and shared because I love to eat and I eat anything and everything as Long it fits my calorie intake daily. Thing is, I never knew the calorie count for Singapore food which amazes me that you guys are able to find out! The best thing is there are macro nutrients, aka, fat, carbs and proteins. That will definitely be better. I wanna win because I seldom have pretty clothes at the gym so let me stand out a little. 🙃🙂$$Liked and Shared! Being a new mother of a 3 month old, it's tough breastfeeding, keeping count of the calories you take in because yours always hungry and exercising! One of the toughest thing is ensuring I lose my pregnancy weight and yet be able to provide my son with the best and most nutritious breast milk! Getting a fitness tracker will definitely help me keep focused, motivated and of course keep track of my intake and exercise! I hope to win this fitness tracker to kick start my healthy pregnancy weight lose regime! :)$$I've always had issues with body image issues and I started out as a fat kid who was always bullied in school because I loved to snack and McDonald's was always my go to. Came February this year and I started being a control freak and limiting my food portion to 1 meal a day and sometimes I struggle to complete it because I was told I needed to lose weight and I wasn't good enough. Now I'm in in a better state and definitely happier and the fitness tracker will definitely aid me in achieving my fitness goals. After all its about being healthy and happy (:$$I'm super lazy at heading out for a walk and Jun Jie knows it best. With the fitness tracker, he can set a target for me to hit every week and motivate me to get out of my house and go for a walk or a run.$$Liked n shared
Since NS days, my weight is a healthy 60kg. Now my weight has ballooned to 80kg. I feel weak, sluggish and no confident. I hope that this tracker can be a reminder to lose weight be healthy. Walking is a simple and effective exercise.
Tan Bee Leng$$I should win as I don't have an activity tracker. I can only roughly track the calories I take daily via googling but I couldn't track the calories burnt. So scared only have in and no out. Wish dearly to own one activity tracker...
Liked and shared.$$Liked and shared. I hope to win Misfit fitness trackers so that I can work on my fitness. My fitness goal is to complete 2.4 km run within 12 mins, that is, 400 m within 2 mins. The fitness trackers will help me track my progress so that I can evaluate and plan my fitness routine.$$Liked and shared this post.I'm a food lover. Hence, is not so easy to maintain a good health. It will be wonderful if I could win Misfit Shine 2. This will help me to maintain my health and keep the doctor away.$$I'm hungry all the time, when I see this tracker on my wrist, I will know how far I came and I will feel guilty if I eat too much. This keeps me on track and helps to lose weight.$$The reason why I would like to win is this. Over the past few years, I've always been eating a lot, like really a lot. Being a 19 year old teenager, you would know how big of an appetite a person would have at this age, where it is a growing up stage, much food is needed. I'm constantly hungry, always upsizing my portion, always eating extras, always having that tea break & supper which is fattening like MCD? Or desserts??? that I probably shouldn't have. End result? Belly fats! Face became much rounder! Do I exercise? Nope, procrastination got the better of me, constantly finding excuses, rather eat & sleep and continue my sedentary lifestyle than to go out there to exercise. It was not until recently that I finally reflect on my actions, I calculated my BMI & I realized that I have to lose 5-8 kg in order to safely stay in the healthy range & not deviate towards the overweight category. For the past few weeks, I've been exercising & hitting the gym for 8 days consecutively now. Of course, my diet is still the biggest struggle to me because every where you go is just food, food and more food right so tell me, how to give up omg. But for the sake of my health, I've already plan this goal of mine, and I'll stick to it. I'll only have 3 meals each day, and stop upsizing my portion. If I feel the need to eat, I can have almonds in between meals, so as to fight the hunger pangs & besides almonds help in weight loss. I'll also hit the gym at least 3-4 times per week, because exercise paired with diet will help me in losing weight faster. 
Of course, diet plays the biggest part because you can exercise but you can also eat and you would need to exercise much longer in order to burn those calories you've consumed. Just as shown those desserts so much calories omg. 
I've been doing research here & there and of course action speaks louder than words. My goal is simple, to lose 5 kg before 2017. What the mind can conceive, it can achieve. :) so definitely, I hope that this fitness tool will further motivate me. Nothing is impossible. I'm possible :) cheers.$$I would want to win the Misfit Shine 2 to help me track my activities and be healthy. So that I can continue to enjoy in my indulgence and still be able to fit into my clothes.$$Liked and instantly shared!!!

I wanna win the fitness tracker because danggg the holidays has overtook my entire body. When bored I eat, go out with friends also eat, after working out go cafe eat again. I need my discipline back!!! Somemore next holiday gonna go vacay, need beach bod (kidding) 😂 but really, desperate times calls for desperate measures. Halpppp!! :'($$I want to win because I love desserts too much but cannot desert my weight loss goal; having my own Misfit Shine 2 will motivate me to transform into Miss Fit! 😊

Hokkien Prawn Mee, also affectionately known as 福建蝦麵, is another favourite of every local in Singapore. In this amazing video by our friends The MeatMen, they show you how to easily make this local favourite.

http://themeatmen.sg/hokkien-prawn-mee-%E7%A6%8F%E5%BB%BA%E8%9D%A6%E9%BA%B5/ ","Wrong step. Lard and garlic should be add first. Fry it then it will be more fragrant.  Eggs should not be added first. Not necessary to add fish sauce. The prawn head, bones, soya bean and rock sugar broth is tasteful enough. Adding fish sauce may cover up the fragrant.$$Thanks for the receipe, I really loved it$$Step all wrong. The standard or perfect way to 
1) brew the bones with a bit of 'yellow bean' and dried ikan bilis for hours
2) dry fried the prawn shell separately without anything
3) add in the prawn shell into the soup using filter bag
Brew for at least another 30 mins in slow heat after it boil. Dip the prawn, squid and pork during this time - 50% cook will do.
4) add in little salt and rock sugar and brew for at least another 10 mins
5) fried garlic using lard
6) fried yellow noodles with bee hoon (prefer thin bee hoon)
7) Add in eggs and stir fried
8) add in stock and stir
9) add all other ingredients on top and cover for 20 to 30 seconds in high heat
10) stir fried to even it
Ready to serve$$No doubt I love hokkien mee very much, but yours receipe too much work to be done. I think I rather save all the troubles. In s'pore u can find some really delicious hokkien mee stall. Anyway, tks for sharing.$$Tnx a lot 鈡琇鈴 for the recipe but it's a lot of work ley!

Because no one really believes""every school is a good school"".

It's that time of the year again where you look at school rankings that try not to have rankings but fail because everyone just looks at rankings and if there isn't an official ranking, people will make one up and the one that makes the most sense would become the unofficial, official ranking.

""Good"" is a relative position on a spectrum. For there to be ""Good"" schools, there have to be ""Bad"" schools too. That being said, academic results alone do not determine a ""good"" school. There are many other factors like environment, suitability, quality of staff, location etc. But certainly, some schools are better then others. And what's a ""Good school"" to you may be ""Bad"" to another.

Good luck everyone in picking the best school for YOU.

http://mustsharenews.com/secondary-school-ranking/Because getting into the correct secondary school is very important, you know","Every school is a good school is a general term to make parents feel good. MOE upgrades schools to provide equivalent infrastructure to schools, so in terms of infrastructure all schools have good infrastructures. Take a tour of schools and you can feel the difference in the school tone. Some have very vibrant tones and an aura of learning whilst others are just the opposite. The behaviour of its cohort also are vastly different in these 2 groups of schools.

Whatever we conquer or lost remains there below.” I believe that, and that is why I love hiking because upon reaching the summit you feel a sense of greatness and yet you also feel humble – a contrast of emotions.

Banaue, Ifugao 

What is it?
In Ifugao and every other part of the country, the best tour guides are the locals. They're knowledgeable, friendly and you won't have to worry too much about a language barrier. Filipino dialects may differ from region to region, but almost everyone speaks English. You're more likely to have an interesting conversation, than fumble with a phrase book! 

Fun Fact:
Don't be alarmed by the red-stained mouths of Banaue locals. It's caused by the chewing of nga-nga or betel nuts, which they find addictive.

But here is the big clinch. When she deposited us back to our hotel, we discovered that she is legally blind (meaning she has very low vision!). Imagine our surprise because we were going up & down the mountains & traversing the rice terraces. But she grew up in that terrain that sight did not really matter.

Brothers Japanese - brothers in spirit and way of life of Kyokushin and other Martial Arts! You in first turn have would help me,, as coach - a disabled person, his brother in spirit and lifestyle of Bushido, which for the sake of the memory of our spiritual teachers Sosai Oyama - more than 30 years of promoting your culture in the face of Kyokushin and free teaching children and youth, and Kyokushin helping children - disabled. Let's connect and brothers help me save the little girl who needs our help, and remember, that you Japanese not-to-face refuse help me, because you are Japanese and this says it all. Oss!!!

Brothers and sisters, Feb. 10 in Paris, Darya Glazkova( Dasha) had a third operation on the brain. The operation was successful, but happened complications of small excerpt and girls delayed in hospital for another week for the treatment and survey. Brothers Japanese and friends - people of good will, the family baby needs your help and support and I ask you for the sake of the memory of our spiritual teachers Sosai Oyama and other Martial Arts and all that is holy for you to help the family Dasha - who as you can. 50 or 100 euros for you it's not money that would do for your family weather, and for family Dasha and for most Dasha - is the ability to save lives. Help save the baby, and remember, that your help child, it you are helping themselves, because it a matter of honor for you, as the pioneers of lifestyle and other Kyokushin Martial Arts which is equal to the world of military brotherhood and self-respecting Japanese person - never refuse to help me coach - disabled (which is at the cost of their health, honor and prosperity - more than 30 years, defended and promoted your culture today needs your help) and a small child and I believe in you, brothers. The required amount of money help purely for the operation - 9700 (nine thousand seven hundred) EUR, together with additional costs due to the complication and unforeseen circumstances: extension of the course treatment for a week, pay for the travel, residence of parents, food, payment of an interpreter - in total about - 20,000 (twenty thousand) euros. 

I know that I have no right you order, but I can not keep and quiet, because we are brothers in spirit and way of life of Kyokushin and other Martial Arts and tomorrow on my place or place this child may be you or your child (do not let God) and you'll need the help of others and in this case you will have the right to call someone to help you and you are not afraid, that people just refuse help you - as refuse and you, because no one in this life itself does not survive, because people are always helping each other and it God's law which has not been canceled and have whether you're right - it is ignored? Here and think as you be brothers and yes helping you God and your conscience take the right decision.

An Appeal to the United Nations from a former Filipino Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly

I am Michael Francis Acebedo Lopez, a Filipino and a former delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. Nearly ten years before the questionable rise of one Leni Robredo to the Philippine Vice Presidency, I had the honor of representing my country, the Philippines, as the youngest Filipino delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in its history. I also had the opportunity to be the Philippines’s first actual Youth Representative or Delegate, a partial fulfillment of our commitment to the UN’s World Programme of Action for Youth or WPAY. 

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accepted my letter of credential signed by the Philippine Foreign Minister. There it was stated that I was attending the General Assembly “as Adviser to the Third Committee Plenary Session on Social Development, including questions relating to the World Social Situation and to Youth, Ageing, Disabled Persons and the Family.” In the august halls of the UN World Headquarters in New York, I also had the honor to draft and deliver the Philippine Statement to the General Assembly’s Third Committee. 

In light of Vice President Robredo’s video message to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs posted on TIME Magazine’s website and shared by various media organizations, I am recalling the mandate I was once given in an effort to reach out to all of you, member states of the UN and all organizations within the UN System. If said mandate is not sufficient because it has long since lapsed, I am hinging my appeal therefore on my being a natural born citizen of one of only four Asian nations who signed the 1945 Charter that created the United Nations. 

I am making this urgent appeal on behalf of each and every Filipino grossly misrepresented by our a Vice President in said video message, a Vice President whose own mandate has been called into question, with the highest electoral tribunal of the land, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, having considered the election protest against her win to be sufficient in both form and substance. 

With unfounded claims and unsubstantiated allegations, Vice President Robredo wantonly painted an impossibly grim image of the Philippine situation if only to attract international attention and action. To say that she delved in speculation is understating the gravity of her made-up claims and the severity of the damage she has caused on our country and our people in so doing. In reporting to the world what she failed to report to Philippine authorities, assuming there are actual reports received by the Office of the Vice President, she has not only embarrassed our country, she has betrayed the public trust and committed economic sabotage, both punishable under Philippine laws. 

For her to say that “our people feel both hopeless and helpless” is a brazen lie. Confidence in the presidency is at an all time high (while the same cannot be said of the vice president whose approval ratings continue to plummet); as a people, we feel hopeful and empowered like we’ve never felt before. 

Please understand that at the heart of this is destructive party politics. It is the Vice President’s party flexing its muscles to overthrow a duly elected government so they may once more regain control of government. Perhaps she feels time is running out for her because of developments in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal. So she and her allies have launched an expensive campaign using human rights and the War on Drugs as their excuse to bait the world into interfering in our domestic issues. 

When the Vice President says 7,000 people have been killed in the President’s War on Drugs, she fails to mention that this is set against the backdrop of around 700,000 to one million successful arrests and surrenders. So the figure she presents to you is not even one percent. And surely with the sheer number of those involved in the illicit drug trade, some police operations see suspects resisting arrest and fighting back and the police having to defend themselves resulting in casualties. Every war has casualties. It is not a perfect war and I’m certain there have been abuses along the way, and these need to be looked into and those responsible must be brought to justice. But exaggerating things does not help at all. 

In asking for the international community, the UN, to intervene, she uses the issue of human rights. Let us then talk about human rights. 

In responding to the call of Robredo, the international community must tread carefully lest it encroaches on our very sovereignty and our right to self-determination. And as a sovereign state, we have determined to wage an internal war (not a war against another nation) against the evils of drugs, a direction affirmed by our democratic processes when President Duterte who included the War on Drugs as one of his main programs of action, received an overwhelming mandate during the May 2016 Presidential Election. In short, the War on Drugs, by extension, has the people’s mandate. 

Any effort to disturb our democracy and sovereignty as a response to the Vice President’s irresponsible and unfounded claims will subvert the will of the Filipino people and violate our Human Right of Suffrage enshrined in both the Philippine Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 21 of the international covenant). 

Once again, I am making this appeal to all member states of the United Nations and all organizations within the UN System to disregard the Philippine Vice President’s statement which is, I reiterate, a grave misrepresentation of the prevailing sentiments of our people and a gross perversion of the facts surrounding the War on Drugs. 

To my fellow Filipinos, let us remain vigilant in the face of threats to our democracy by the very people who claim to defend it. Ako po’y nanawagan na i-share ang video na ito upang ito ay umabot sa UN at sa iba’t ibang foreign governments. 

Maraming salamat. Thank you and good evening.

Among the must-see natural beauty surrounding El Nido is Miniloc Island. We hopped on a boat for a day-long journey and upon arriving at this lagoon, everyone was eager to get in the water. Kayaking between the narrow, tower-leaning limestone cliffs with the greenest of vegetation was a breathtaking spectacle. While other sites allow wonderment from afar, witnessing it first-hand was unique. It was like something out of a movie, one I didn't want to end.

Clark, Pampanga

What is it like? 
It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

13315,225524117535380_991125854308532,"This is the true spirit of CNY. 

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

#bestyeyeintheworldI am still recovering from a massive sobbing fit as I type this, so do pardon me if there are any typos or grammatical errors. This year, my family's CNY reunion dinner went completely beyond my expectaitions.

Last August I came out to Mum and Dad, and was promptly kicked out. I had prepared for the worst, though, and moved in with a friend. So all went well, more or less, except for me being somewhat depressed and withdrawn. I was not expecting to be called back for the reunion this year.

Enter my maternal grandfather, Ye Ye, a.k.a. The Colonel. He retired from the Malaysian army as a colonel, and is still much respected in the family. The fact that he takes no crap from anyone probably helped that. I was about to go for a drink (alone) for my CNY eve, when he called me. What follows is a rough outline of what he said:

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

Ye Ye himself was at the dinner table, and stood up when he saw me. What he said right then still rings in my ears.

""This is XXXX. My grandson. Some of you think he is not fit to be part of this family home simply because he is attracted to men instead of women. Shame on you! If he leaves, I will too, and FUCK anyone who dares to tell me otherwise!""

The whole house went quiet, and Ye Ye told me to come over and have some food. I was in tears by then, and he told me not to cry, and that he was sorry for not doing anything earlier (according to him no one told him anything until the afternoon, whe=n he noticed me missing from my usual spot chopping vegetables). Dinner was a silent affair, but he did ask me a lot of questions about how I'd been, whether I was happy, so on.

After dinner, I went to see him in his room, and cried. I knelt down and asked for forgiveness for not continuing his family line and for having brought any shame to him. But this man, my grandfather, a military veteran, just told me that it was fine, and that I had done no wrong. That I had been enough of a man to speak the truth, and that by doing so, he was more proud of me than if I had chosen to live a double life. He did admit to some disappointment that he wouldn't get any great grandchildren from me, but in his words, 'some things in life are not meant to be'.

God bless you Ye Ye.

A change of pace from the majestic Kawasan Falls, we came across this little, private sanctuary on a hike through Boljoon. With a day not going as planned, a reward like this to stumble upon made the adventure all the more worth it. As late afternoon progressed, the greens showed off their vibrancy in the shade and we rested our tired feet in this natural pool. Sitting here was not only a reminder of the magic you can find exploring this country's jungle, but the benefits of spontaneity.

Baguio, Benguet

What is it?
Horses were brought to the Philippines from islands of Malaysia. And then more came with the Spanish from China and Japan. In Baguio City in the north, you can go horseback-riding in Wright Park. There's an inner circle for waking horses and outer circle for running horses.  ""Pony Boys"" will help and watch over you and the horse the whole time, to keep you safe.

Fun Fact:
The Filipino word for horse is kabayo – derived rom the Spanish word, caballo. Kabayo is also a Filipinos term for an ironing board, due to its horse-like shape.

Model: Alicia Teng ","Update: As of 27th June, Fish & Chicks has a new outlet in the basement of Cineleisure. YAY!!$$i get that it is nice, but fish skins, burgers, fish and chips, crabs, come on la.... there are nicer things to eat right. lol$$Tried it recently. Not worth the hype. Can't really taste the salted egg nor the chilli crab. As good as eating the normal fish and chips.$$The worst fish & chips I have ever tasted. Waited for 3hrs, fish over cooked & zero salted egg taste. Not worth for money & time.$$Went over at 6pm on Friday. No Q. Ordered for 2 pax. Even clarified with the staff whether it was only that 1 plastic bag to take away. Reached home, zero sides. Gravy too sweet, batter tasteless. Didn't go back to change as we don't live nearby and we had a sick baby to look after. As a food establishment that allows and handles tabaos.. We felt cheated of our 4 sides.$$Please do not waste your time with this store. 

The salted egg had no inkling of salted egg in it. It tasted like some mashed potato sauce. 

The Chili crab tasted like Chili crab, but slightly diluted. It did not go well with fish and chips at all. 

Garlic rice was nothing special. Just oily rice with a hint of garlic. Tom yum rice is a disaster and can't even be called Tom yum rice. 

Herb infused fish, tastes like sour, salty fish. 

I am not being harsh, but the food they sell isn't worth travelling to experience. It's below mediocre and I'd rather opt for the kopitiam food below my house.$$Went at 925pm and they were already closed. Chefs were still cooking and the counter still had the 15min waiting time board on. Counter staff rudely told us ""sorry we are closed"" while closing cash register and not having any eye contact. Oh wells. 

We went over to Murphys a few feet away and im Glad we didn't dine at Fish & Chicks.$$BengBeng Lim is this what u talking about.. Not prata lah. Is fish n chips$$Wonder if there is a salted egg prata shop in singapore🤔🤔🤔$$Went to the place but didn't like the fish and chips. Ate them both. But chicken chop was good. Bad intro.

Izit Sutchi catfish (Cream Dory)?

Also nice own goal by blocking the view from pedestrian overpasses. But you say that it is about safety and keeping the overpasses unobstructed. Except domestic helpers obstruct the overpasses every Sunday and that seems okay. And except the fact that you blocked the windows in the IFC. 

The E formula demonstrated the HK government's sense of entitlement to spend taxpayer money on entertainment for themselves and the ruling class.

Btw, nobody wants more tourists. 55mn already in a city of 7mn. The E formula served no public good at all. But nice job patting yourselves on the back.$$Disgraceful. Not sure the best £2 millions spent for promoting HK. It's only attracted (estimated by officials) 40k tourists and hand full of rich and privilege minorities to enjoy the event.

But is Sweden really better than Singapore? This Swedish guy made 2 videos to say: NO.

https://mustsharenews.com/singapore-sweden-videos/","I think Singaporeans take housing for granted the most. Across the world, house ownership is a pipe dream for an entire generation of millennials. Not to say housing in SG is perfect, but at least it's attainable.$$Having to visit Stockholm a month ago, I tend to agree that SG is better than Sweden (while I do like their architecture). Their cabs are insane, no regulations and touting for business and ridiculously priced. The licensed one that I took cost me S$80 from airport to city and the drive said unlicensed ones can cost up to S$200... Unlike other Scandinavian countries, people there don't seem to be as friendly or happier... Food and transport were also more expensive than Denmark and Finland, even public areas are dirtier than their 2 counterparts. So yeah, I'll pick SG anytime over Sweden$$Why bother to compare and say which is better? There will always be things that are better on 1 side but there will also be things that are worse. It's like when you are in school and got 89 marks for your test. And then your mom comes and say why u no like the other kid who got 92 marks and ignoring the fact that your 89 mark is actually the second highest, better than the other 30 kids in the class. Sigh....$$Be contented with what you have. Singaporeans complain too much. If singapore was so bad then please give up your space to someone who will appreciate it more.$$The grass is always greener on the other side, there's no perfect system of governance, just a better balance of left and right...$$Singapore is great if you can afford to uber everywhere like the  Swedish guy,  or afford private housing which that guy seems to ('much more attractive option anyway' or something like that)$$Sure you wanna compare?
... Singapore government taxes us More than 300 over percent for buying just a car, and that's exclude the earnings our local car dealers are profiting in the process$$Malaysia even much better than both countries provided you are not align to any politics here . Expatriates with their salaries have a wonderful life here.$$I think he forgot to compare salary vs living cost to yield expendable income, it is not fair to compare just area vs area without comparing the above. For vandalism and subway, I agree that SG is way better than any other country (except HK :P) due to absolute strict law. No cigarette butt due to strict law again. Glass door on subway station and the safety cone on construction area / road is for safety and to avoid subway company and government bodies being sued by passenger accident. While due to strict law, order is there always. This area Singapore always better than any other country in the world.$$Rubbish article. In SG, most of the time you do not own the property but rent it for 99 years.  And that is full rental payment up front upon signing the ""ownership"" lease.

Transport is easy becos we are a small city.  MRT?  Rofl!  Really?  Dun think all our MRTs have screen doors.  All of them started WITHOUT screen doors and we had our share of people being pushed or fell onto the tracks.

He should really do more research before posting this fake news.$$Might as well compare our houses to mansion houses and say we are deplorables? 

This goalpost changing where everyone has their own criteria is annoying.

Everyone wants the MRT to be better. Like common$$I have also lived in both countries and this article is so biased it is not even funny$$Cos they are treated special here with the Asians kowtowing to them??..Back, in Sweden, they are just common White..😂$$Try stealing a chair in singapore lor... you can go jail and get fine... lol singapore so small where you gonna run ? And why would Singaporean wanna steal a chair that's worth $50-$100 when the fine is $2000 and get jailed... probably because Singaporean will think of consequences first before acting.$$He just tasting the icying on the cake.. wait till he gets the whole cake and see if Singapore is still sweet...$$Singaporeans take things for granted. Only if they have lived abroad for a few years will they then know its Great To Be Home (SINGAPORE). i HOPE THIS VIDEO BY STEFAN WAKES SINGAPOREANS UP ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG ONES.$$Housing and transport. SG is only better if you have 3 to 4 times more cash than the middle class folks in these countries. And sg weather is hot and humid uncomfortable!$$The girls in Sweden are hotter. Nothing to do with this article but a valid point for choosing Sweden.$$Because you are not Singapore citizen, yet.$$Most singaporean 生在福中，不知福！Just know how to complain and expect things to be in their 'perfect' way!$$That's show how FTs are not welcome to theirs country....so stop dreaming.$$I just read the comments and again I'm reminded that people only hear/see what they want.

Contrary to what most of us believe, Singapore’s entertainment scene pre-USS may have been even bigger than it is today.

It was a time of vintage ferris wheels, travelling circuses, rickety rides, bustling food stalls, cabaret performances, and flashy night clubs where entertainment-seekers could dance the night away. Technology wasn’t needed to keep the locals entertained, and many found joy in the simple rides and games booths.

We should never forget the amusement parks which defined Singapore’s entertainment scene, each having added their own pop of colour to our country’s cultural history.

Adopting a ‘modern tropical resort’ concept, the mosque was inspired by Raja Muda Perlis (Prince of Perlis), Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra Syed Sirajuddin Jamalulail, and realised by a prominent businessman, Tan Sri Mohd. Ariffin Yusuf, who had named the mosque in honour of his late brother..!""

Its townscape preserves history stretching from the Edo Period (1603-1868) when samurai were still commonplace, to the Meiji and Taisho Periods (1868-1926) when European cultural influence grew. Even tourist information centers and a bank are housed in restored historic buildings. Two small boats are always combing the river where, during the daytime, visitors can enjoy a view of the riverbanks while experiencing a gondola-style boat ride. When it gets dark, the streets are gently enveloped by soft illumination, making the area enjoyable at night time as well.

The Holy Mass is not for entertainment; it is for the glorification of God and for the sanctification of the Faithful. There is a proper time and place for everything; the Mass should be reserved for worship, not for unliturgical acts and greetings. Lastly, most of us are Roman Catholics, hence, we follow the Roman Rite. The Roman style of worship is rigid, concise, and solemn in nature. Clerics should not innovate and personalise the rituals in the Holy Mass. If it is not written in the rubrics and in liturgical documents, it should not be done. -- It's a blessing that the priest accepted his mistake.

Visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a unique and exhilarating experience. Spectacular scenery, white sandy beaches and swaying palms combine with monuments and museums, world-class diving, swimming and sun basking make this a truly out-of-the-world experience. 

The Archipelago contains 362 volcanic islands scattered in the Bay of Bengal, with only 37 of these being inhabited. These lush green islands have colourful historical past, with strings of invasions by the French, Dutch, Japanese and British and wars between settlers and the native tribes. The Cellular Jail, where hundreds of Indian revolutionaries were imprisoned during the Indian freedom struggle, still stands tall. 

Descendents of these political prisoners and the local tribes of the area are the inhabitants of modern day Andaman and Nicobar. The tropical rain forests that loom close to the seashore are home to unique species of birds, and to tribes that still haven't learned to use fire. 

- See more at: http://www.incredibleindia.org/travel/destination/andaman-nicobar ","Horrible experience for a trip to Incredible India!nmThe visa fees are very high as if they do not want tourists to come, Had to go to the visa agent center 3 times and the consulate once just for a visa and I'm from the USA, for Dubai you just walk in the clean airport, no fees and you are truly welcomed,  the same for Malaysia and Mexico.

Once you arrive after a long long flight you are hit with humidity and rude immigration people and custom officers that look like they are on the hunt for bribes. As soon as you leave the Mumbai airport you are welcomed with garbage in every street, people defecating and urinating in the side of building and open sewers,

Once you get to your friends home you will discover that running water is luxury and electricity is cut every few hours and is not stable, they have stabilizers at every tv and fridge to prevent it from blowing up.

Animals and insects are abundant and plentiful and bathrooms look like no one cleans it with bleach and cleaners.

poverty and wealth live side by side and its sad rich people pretend the poor do not exist except to work for them.

organized gangs of beggars are all over the main city streets.

western women are molested with mens eyes and Vulgar words.

cops look like they are after money not safety or order .

no disrespect to Indians, they are great people.$$Before pointing fingers on us Check how much problems exist in your country-https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0CCMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPoverty_in_the_United_States&ei=ZEgYVfGuLNO3uATKrYLIDg&usg=AFQjCNGqx8cpfdFViLdqmZCKMyN8JkDsOA&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0CC0QFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npc.umich.edu%2Fpoverty%2F&ei=ZEgYVfGuLNO3uATKrYLIDg&usg=AFQjCNEij7WDMp8iAq2OJTha9CVzRFeatQ&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0CFQQFjAH&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2Fus-money-blog%2F2015%2Fjan%2F17%2Fpublic-school-students-poverty-report&ei=ZEgYVfGuLNO3uATKrYLIDg&usg=AFQjCNHFWw9J9M0XF_QY66Ubv0WVnt2jpA&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0CFsQFjAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmoney.cnn.com%2F2014%2F09%2F16%2Fnews%2Feconomy%2Fmedian-income-poverty-rate-down-census%2F&ei=ZEgYVfGuLNO3uATKrYLIDg&usg=AFQjCNG5nOP6UM-PQddf9IKr_iMq3aUH2w&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=10&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0CGEQFjAJ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fblogs%2Fwonkblog%2Fwp%2F2014%2F10%2F29%2Fchild-poverty-in-the-u-s-is-among-the-worst-in-the-developed-world%2F&ei=ZEgYVfGuLNO3uATKrYLIDg&usg=AFQjCNEsyCfaUvbfhIh9TqAagV-klDjiUw&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=13&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDMQFjACOAo&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2014%2F09%2F16%2Fpoverty-household-income_n_5828974.html&ei=skgYVfSWGdWPuATOtoG4Bw&usg=AFQjCNGbcNQJyRZjEZfcK7r0CjtcJ0g29w&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CD8QFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prb.org%2FPublications%2FArticles%2F2009%2Fruralchildpoverty.aspx&ei=00gYVZ7WHpeSuASOpIDIDg&usg=AFQjCNEQcIDEUIfNUykQDlmKuFaNSiQXBA&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=10&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CGkQFjAJ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.feedingamerica.org%2Fhunger-in-america%2Fimpact-of-hunger%2Frural-suburban-and-urban-hunger%2Frural-hunger-fact-sheet.html&ei=00gYVZ7WHpeSuASOpIDIDg&usg=AFQjCNHiUW0vxDRke8v5gQm3GGsi3h-X2A&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CGMQtwIwCA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DH8RIFtrXMAk&ei=00gYVZ7WHpeSuASOpIDIDg&usg=AFQjCNE8wt05UouZP_vTXPcNdCaeTKHpgQ&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Ffed-gap-between-rich-poor-americans-widened-during-recovery-1409853628&ei=BUkYVeXXHpCjugTD2oDIDg&usg=AFQjCNEI2eoN0f1ECysofqTTjefAbegLCA&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCYQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfgate.com%2Fopinion%2Farticle%2FAmericans-unaware-of-staggering-gap-between-rich-5797486.php&ei=BUkYVeXXHpCjugTD2oDIDg&usg=AFQjCNFIH8jl5_qddnl8A8Ran9DHe0Jn1Q&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=10&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CFIQFjAJ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fbusiness%2F2014%2F05%2F21%2Frich-poor-widest-gap%2F9351639%2F&ei=BUkYVeXXHpCjugTD2oDIDg&usg=AFQjCNGPU85vAfmQItEQY-Fdv7oeddv0wQ&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRape_in_the_United_States&ei=dEkYVfPhMM-cugSSlIHIDg&usg=AFQjCNF88YRtATl9IDMCIzwlhcoKb-1egw&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CFUQFjAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2013%2F11%2F21%2Frape-study-report-america-us_n_4310765.html&ei=dEkYVfPhMM-cugSSlIHIDg&usg=AFQjCNH9IsHrdKMyvFU5de-VYMHPkF4OVA&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=20&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CFIQFjAJOAo&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2014%2Fnov%2F13%2Fnew-orleans-police-routinely-ignored-cases-report-finds&ei=okkYVZ79NMOBuwTW-oDADg&usg=AFQjCNEwLt490KIfamIR3TfTvyhyJHmMUQ&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E; https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCwQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCatholic_sex_abuse_cases_in_the_United_States&ei=2EkYVfXtOYq3uASZ3oHIDg&v6u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-v6exp1-ds.metric.gstatic.com%2Fgen_204%3Fip%3D117.203.208.36%26ts%3D1427655129382038%26auth%3Dlwoqmx6icovvxqn64akt3ronuarxz4df%26rndm%3D0.9602564238011837&v6s=2&v6t=7243&usg=AFQjCNGUKyF6nExEwndjaGY5ucscDHt3eA&bvm=bv.89381419,d.c2E",0,0,2,0,2,0,,,,,,

 http://www.lakas.com.ph/2012/06/how-much-did-i-spend-on-our-overnight-trip-to-bataan/How much did I spend on our overnight trip to Bataan June 13, 2012by Josiah 24 Comments I was looking for a quick overnight trip to the beach and was asking friends on where I could go, but here’s the catch, I only had 1,000 Pesos for my budget inclusive of transportation, food and lodging. I asked…","I spend more than that on San Mig lites...a day! Have more fun in the Philippines$$we don't need to spend so much to be able to experience the best thing in life.$$Must of been severely de-hydrated, very hungry, lucky to find transport and not scammed$$It takes common sense to not waste as much money on things that aren't needed.$$I miss myself seeing there$$It is depend where (location or country) you arrange your vacation (transaction because currency is different)...  the last time I went to visit to Philippines my sisters purchased my round trip ticket. ( I do not have NO MORE excuses not to visit them... I was glad I was in a little recovery, I did my travelled alone and shared my story to my ONLY TWO sisters I was divorced... I did not see my eldest sister and brother at that time because I still tried to AVOID any question... because I do not want them to feel bad or give them any worry) the ticket was cheaper to compare IF I purchase or did transaction in USA. ( more money)..............  Long time ago my husband and I arrange our hotel somewhere in Philippines (Island).. the hotel room in US dollar (work for dollar and spend into dollar is fine) is acceptable BUT it is too much for citizen of the country to convert the currency of money. FOREIGNER visiting other country their money have more value (exchange rate)... some foreigner (let's say a rich person CAN afford to visit or  purchased other Island or business investment) .... BUT ... it is also depend to what and who... another example: It is depend LOCATION, a small house (from estate or agent) to conversion of money (let's say dollar to pesos) In Philippines a decent house is more expensive to compare to the house I used to have...  When my brother-in-law (french) visited us ... just for KNOWLEDGE or idea, still the house in Philippines more money to compare to the houses around...... another example: My parents want to build a house they have in mind.... so they do not want to LOAN to the bank (which they are qualified to do so at that time)... my mother do not want any worry. so she saved money and pay cash for piece of land. And saved again then when enough to build a decent house THEN they start the building the house.... what is the different is that THE LAND (per square foot) IS SO EXPENSIVE to compare to other area (location) the piece of land worth can be three time worth to other area. SO in everything includes PLANNING, BUDGETING, asking REASON why it is necessary.... what is the GOAL...........  I ask my mother why our house and land is small to compare to our neighbors because we have big family (in our area... our neighbor have one child, next have three children, and next have one child).... mother explain to me.... LOAN is nice to the EARS but painful to HER (mother) pocket.... Yes, she is qualified to borrow money to the bank but she made the right decision.... heaven knows best our neighbor work as a government employees and some privilege or benefits opportunity.... deductible from their salary BUT and BUT be CAREFUL to any retirement money (invested)  BECAUSE their house can be foreclosure and wasted all the money they gave (or paid). ANOTHER EXAMPLE: You purchased a land (sq ft as you like) and transaction you already gave certain amount of money. THEN duration period with interest monthly to pay the balance of land purchased... let's say contract is two years... One years you put effort to pay BUT then stop because something happen (loss job or emergency prioritizing)... with five months late payment and with interest... MORE you cannot afford to pay, so it will be thank you to you.... TIME and EFFORT of hard work was gone, just like that. I am so deeply thankful and grateful for the opportunity I question my mother for some stuff I do not understand and with her warm heart never get tire to express her thoughts and feelings to some CERTAIN situation.... mother do not like to share problem BUT I am thankful because Signs and symptoms of language of thoughts and feelings.. I know my mother because even I was just a little kid I UNDERSTOOD tender loving care through action. From fetus as passive immunity (warm caring heart) acquired and immune response with gentle gracious warm heart. One of the reason I can read their thoughts and feelings because I do not know, I just feel it. BECAUSE I spent time with them. Word is silent because Silent is action.. Tender Loving Care is not only a word but ACTION as verb. The side effect was EFFECTIVE because I am  thankful and grateful  to my beloved parents, siblings and loved ones with their warm HEARTS..... CURRENCY ... a money conversion to some with higher value and to some same value and to some low value............................. Tender Loving Care is like a CURRENCY BOND.... value in legal tender.

Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and Sicogon Development Corporation (SIDECO) will launch Sicogon Island Tourism Estate development within the first half of 2016.

The ALI-SIDECO joint venture is expected to drive economic progress in Western Visayas and the entire region as it serves as a tourism hub for surrounding or nearby destinations like Gigantes, Bantayan and Concepcion islands.

The 1,100-hectare Sicogon Island will feature a balanced mix of developments, such as a resort town center, hotels and resorts, as well as commercial and residential establishments, supported by an on-site airstrip.  The ground breaking of the airport runway is scheduled for the second half of the year.

“The initial development will concentrate on building the airport and runway, to ensure accessibility to the island,” said Jose Emmanuel Jalandoni, ALI Senior vice president and group head of commercial business.  “The 1.3-kilometer runway will allow immediate access from Manila and Cebu to the island development,” he added, saying further that test flights to Sicogon are being targeted for the first quarter of 2017.

The project is supported by public, private and community organizations, and government bodies alike because of the potential economic benefits it will bring to the region.  A framework agreement was signed by ALI, SIDECO, and the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk Association (FESIFFA) in 2014 to pave the way for the sustainable development of Sicogon Island.  The group has been assisting the local community through skills training and livelihood programs to make them active partners in the development.

“We strongly believe and hope that poverty alleviation will be achieved through tourism projects.  These will give us various job opportunities and help us improve farming and fishing methods,” said Raul Ramos, president of FESIFFA.

Jalandoni stressed that sustainability will be a main focus of the project.  Aside from allocating more than 50% of the development for open green space, ALI will also work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to continue stewardship of Sicogon’s forested area, and work on coastal protection and marine life rehabilitation in support of sustainable development.

“More than becoming a premier tourist destination and a tourism hub for the region, Sicogon is envisioned to provide inclusive growth and economic development through long-term recovery and livelihood programs, and job creation,” said Jalandoni.

ALI estimates that the Sicogon Island development will provide 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly with increased tourism, and approximately P1 billion in earnings for the community through business opportunities that will come from the retail and commercial establishments.

http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/how-much-money-you-will-make-based-on-personalityHow much money will I make? Most people ask this question but never know the answer. How you make decisions affects how much you earn. Find out your score.","Article would have been more helpful to the readers if it provides career guidance for each personality type rather than stating which types earn the highest income. I seriously doubt the two wealthiest individuals in the world, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, spend that much time being social. Also, Warren Buffett is well-known for being a straight arrow.

Instead of forcing people to change their personalities, it is more helpful to provide suggestions on how each type can leverage on his strengths to earn a higher income. May I recommend you read this book called ""The Millionaire Code: 16 Paths to Wealth Building"" by Paul B. Farrell, JD, PhD. The world is blessed by people with different skill sets and strengths, not those with the same.

Having said this, I wholeheartedly agree with you that we need to work on some of our weaknesses to become better people. Not necessarily to make more money, but more to enrich the lives of others around us.",0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,

Tried many other brands but UFC is still the best :)$$ive been hooked on to coconut water since the end of last year and ive been spending so much money on coconut water im not even kidding. and like fauzi says :its not overrated to stay hydrated""$$I would love to win this because it is a healthy drink but taste so nice. Low in calories, low in sugar, pure and natural. It is also an alternative to drinking water and keeping your body hydrated! 

Have tried almost all the coconut juice brand, none tastes as good as UFC!

Liked and shared!! Hope to win!$$Tried this brand of coconut water and love it. It taste natural, without any sugar enhancing the taste and I always feel much more refreshing after drinking the coconut water. It's also a healthier choice of drink instead of getting soft drink! Great taste and many health benefits in short!$$Coconut water is a great alternative to sports drink to stay well hydrated  after a workout!! It's low in calories, naturally fat- and cholesterol free and contains super high in potassium are just some of the many wonderful benefits it provides.

Unlike some other brands out there, UFC coconut water is only sourced from fresh and natural young coconuts from Thailand, under the strictest quality to ensure the consumers receive the finest product!! 

That aside, I really hope to win to win the coconut water as I recently started working out (that's was one of my 2016 resolution) and since discovering the amazing benefits of coconut water, I've never ever am touching those sugary sports drink again!! The down side if I must say is that coconut water cost anywhere 1.5X to 2X more than sports drink, and winning them would help me save a bit!! HAHAHAHA All the best$$I would like to win a carton of UFC Coconut water because I often drink coconut water because of its nutritional properties. It contains all the essential electrolytes and helps hydrate the body efficiently which results in little to no muscle cramps during my training. In addition, coconut water tastes way better than plain water. There's just something about coconut water that makes you feel really relaxed after drinking it!$$I like to win a carton of UFC Refresh Coconut Water because I love the UFC Coconut Water and I buy it regularly from the supermarket.

You've come to the right place, they said. After 36 hours of travel, we awoke to the brilliant yellows of sunrise reaching over, what seemed to be, infinite waters. We threw on our bathing suits, lathered on the sun lotion, and jumped on a boat set for the islands off of Palawan.

From what I gathered from past tropical destinations, I half-expected these islands to be bustling with tourists. Dropping anchor here was a stunning surprise, setting our sights on the surroundings with not another person in sight. We scrambled for the snorkel gear, and dove into the blue to witness the vibrant coral and sea life. Day one on our adventure, and already one I won't forget.

Barracuda Lake, Palawan

How to Get There:
Fly from Manila to Busuanga, then transfer to a van bound for Coron.

What is it?
There are many amazing and unusual dive sites in the Philippines and Barracuda Lake is one of them. It starts with a 10-minute hike up a limestone mountain. Then you’ll be able to enjoy a 33-meter dive to a narrow cave. 

Fun Fact:
The Barracuda Lake is named for its resident barracuda. If you’re lucky, it might become your dive buddy.

Witness nature’s headlong tumble, as the Sharavati River makes a spectacular drop of 956 ft in four distinct cascades – known locally as Raja, Rani, Roarer and Rocket – to create the fifth highest falls in Asia. One of India’s greatest scenic wonders, the Jog Falls is at their exuberant best during the monsoon, with arching rainbows colouring the mist. 

When the sluice gates of the upstream Linganamakki Dam are closed, taking a walk right down to the bottom of the gorge is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. A large hydro electric power plant is located down stream here.

At their outlet, I can find items for  half the original price; makes a bargain queen like me especially happy when I find a good deal.

(Which is best for me as i am always in budget) if i'd to choose, i will definitely pick Royal Sporting House as there are so many sport brands at discounted items??? Quality and lower prices, who won't love this? I do. So pick me cos i love all things cheap ;)$$Owndays Outlet. I've always a perfect shades, after mine broke a few weeks ago.

Liked😻 Shared👏🏽$$The store which I most looked forward to visiting when I am at IMM would be the Charles & Keith outlet! 
Shoes are usually at half price, or even less. Usually there are not many sizes left, but because I have big feet =P size 8, its no problem at all finding something to buy at Charles & Keith outlet! . Many pretty shoes at great price, this place is a haven for shoes lovers like me!

Hope to be the lucky ones to win. Thank you very much

VIRTUAL GUIDANCE 
The supreme being primordial left guidance lines for mankind. These guidance are didactic that tell 
mankind about their self. As well as about what’s around them. The guidance lines exist with us as basic 
facts of life. Like there are nine planets in the solar system and it take nine months for a child to development in the womb and then birth. The moon revolve around the earth every 27 days. Woman 
have there menstruation every 27 days. There are 4 seasons in one year; spring, summer, fall, and winter. The woman goes through 4 stages in her life. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause and death. The feeling of zero gravity in space is equivalent to swimming in water. The big bang theory is when the sun 
was made, the planets and universe also stars. The mind when it is made (educated); makes houses, 
building, cars things. Mankind body is made of solid, liquids and gases. The universe is made of solid, 
liquids and gases. The earth is made up of 75% of water and 25% land (solid). Man physical structure is 
75% water and 25% solid. These guidance lines the supreme being left mankind, guide them into 
knowing existence.$$Chin Yee Ling Carmen Chai Yueyee Crystal Yap",0,4,0,0,2,0,,,,,,

The Indonesian government has given a free visa for 90 countries. #WonderfulIndonesia ","as Indonesian, i am ashame that the guy who made this picture didn't know that Czechoslovakia has disappeared since 1992 and the government of Indonesia gives an extended visa free to a defunct non-existent country. Come on Indonesia...$$I hope its vice versa for indonesian passport holder to visit those countries tho :D$$So the truth about the visa free entry,is that like most things jokowi has tried to do, the corrupt embedded systems have found away around it.  

The way corrupt immigration officials have managed to get around this one are:
1)reducing the 90 free visa (as it is in most of asean)  to 30 days then with a intrusive,  unfriendly,  nasty and corrupt extension possible at immigration offices. 
2)not providing it to the largest incoming tourist group in Bali, Australians,  because a) corrupt officials at the airport are so dependant on that cash coming in.  These are the same government officials who always guarantee there are not enough immigration officers working at anyone time at the Bali airport so that they can offer a discrete express service foe an extra  cash fee and b) just to childishly spite Australia, claiming it is because Australia does not reciprocate with free visa for Indonesians,  conveniently over looking that many many of the 90 countries on the list also don't offer free visas to Indonesians. 
3)only making it available at a few very specific ports of entry,  Jakarta,  Batam, Bali and maybe one or two others,  but yogya for example misses out, which is why some have written that they still had to pay. 
4)by going back to being much more strict on demanding that you already have a return ticket booked out of the country,  which is of course ridiculous in this modern age of last minute online cheap tickets from budget carriers like Air Asia. 

So yeah! Yep we have restricted and still unfriendly in welcoming very short visas foe some countries at some airports.  There is no doubt that is better than before,  but sadly like. Most things Jokowi has tried to do,  it has been watered down dramatically by the old guard, including Mega and JK,  Golkar and the rest of the embedded corrupt government cronies. 
Sad but true
And who loses 
As always outer Indonesia as noone stays long enough to get out there.$$Any valid information about this 90 daya free visa to Indonesia?$$I will visit Indonesia this Christmas. So no more on arrival visa?$$Indonesia is not an English speaking country anyways. Mistakes on the writing above are still forgivable. And it's understandable.$$Do you Interest = *Are you interested*

Earlier given Visa Free = *Visa exempted countries*

Is okay, mistakes do happens sometimes. Let's learn to forgive. :) Peace!$$the country providing the most turis turis to Indonesia is ....

But honestly, we have shelved the idea as there is no direct flight to Kuala Trengganu from either Changi Airport or Senai.

So while we want to support tourism in Malaysia, I think its about time for MAS, Firefly or Airasia do the right thing!

What is it? 
Apart from the spellbinding sunset that prompts romantic trysts along the boardwalk, Manila Bay is also one of the best natural harbors in the world. The large port has always facilitated trade between the Philippines and its neighbors, boosting the economic development even before the Spanish era. Today there is still activity in the area, as it is near one of the largest malls in the world — the SM Mall of Asia.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
For 550 pesos, you can go on an hour-long cruise that comes complete with a set dinner and a live acoustic band. Trips happen daily, but are only scheduled from 4:30pm to 9pm.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/cold-vacations","Congratulations Saldemiu Vic Rebecca, Chan Kar Mun and Michelle Koh on winning a $100 GEOX voucher each :) 

A big thank you to everyone who participated, and to GEOX for sponsoring this giveaway. Head down to the nearest outlet for their ongoing sales this weekend!$$Liked, Shared and love to win $100 GEOX voucher! I had a first pair of GEOX years ago, it was so comfy, and i would love to win a new pair cos the old one was worn to bits :p I could see that a new pair of GEOX boots will keep me warm when i travel to cool climates!!! :)$$Subscribed, liked & shared! I always have trouble on what shoes shall I pack when I travel. Thanks to this post, I am sure going to get a Geox product regardless if I win the voucher or not. But with the voucher, it certainly allows the let me have more pairs!$$When creating a pair of shoes, it is often a struggle between form and function. Not many can strike that fine balance between form and function -- GEOX shoes stand out not only because they have mastered this balance, but they have upped the ante by adding comfort to its highest possible level. 

I have never owned a pair of GEOX before but I truly believe that GEOX lives up to its name as I have seen a pair of GEOX that has been with my friend for almost 10 years. I want to win this GEOX voucher so that I can have a chance to experience this kind of relationship with a shoe! And then influence another person to get GEOX! Thanks in advance for this opportunity!$$Subscribed, liked & shared. Nope, I'm not winning this for myself. I'd like to win this for my mother. She would be traveling to Japan next month and the climate there is said to be really cold. She has never seen snow in her 62 years of living and she intends to wear her track shoes there as she's a thrifty woman. Therefore I sincerely hope to win this voucher so that I can buy her a pair of winter boots to keep her feet warm when she travels to Japan next month. That's the least I could do as a daughter I suppose and not let her wear track shoes while walking in the snow (: happy 2016 to you guys anyway! Cheers*!$$I should win this because Chiang Mai is a lovely place and I'm singing its praises because I have been to this city, had memorable memories and would love to return again. With its breezy mountain weather, cheap food and many cultural places of interest. It's amazing and way better than Bangkok if you are more into the Arts and Cultural sort of person. I did participate in the festivals like Loi Krathong (floating the boat on water) and Lanna (floating lanterns), it's awe- inspiring. And I wish to return to experience the wonder sight of the Sakura blooming and check off my bucket list too!$$I would like to win this for a very special someone Samantha Lee. She is my fiancee. She likes to travel around the world with me. She can definitely have this pair of boots to walk the world with me. Really hope to win this for her.$$I have been travelling a lot and realised that having a good trusty pair of shoes for travel is very important. Many times I have to pack like a pair of sneakers, pumps, slippers etc into my luggage which takes up a lot of space and weight, not forgetting those bulky thick winter coats when travelling to cold countries. Geox is a trustable brand for its comfyness which is stylish, at the same time, to match with all types of outfits! With this pair of boots, I don't have to worry about packing so many shoes into my luggage anymore! Hope I can win this and own my first pair of Geox! 😊🙆$$I should win because I only wear GEOX's shoes after I have foot problems.  It's the only shoes that helps me walk like a normal person again!

Esther L Chng Joy Yeo$$I need to win GEOX voucher because I badly needed a good, comfy but stylish shoes for my holidays! My feet always hurts when I travel specially when walking around. I guess I haven't found my best pair. I'm going to Canada this Winter and this voucher is just in time to buy a new boots!☃

Cos GEOX's comfy shoes will keep me warm when i travel to colder countries!$$I am a frequent traveller and especially loves to explore the streets and paranomic scenery in other countries, especially during Autumn and Winter. Having a good, comfortable for long walks and weatherproof pair of boots is extremely important to me especially since I have flat feet which makes walking for long periods of time challenging. Even Timberland boots only lasted maximum of 3 hours of walking for me when I travel. I hope to find a pair of boots that can lengthen the amount of time I can walk during my travels 😀.$$travelling for work and pleasure is hard to balance but this pair of geox would really make trips much less tiring! can't wait to see how far they can take me to see the world :)$$I owned a pair of GEOX shoes when  I was working in the hospital wards. Translate the 8 hours walking about daily for One Year. It outlasted two other pairs of shoes that I had. Amazing!!. I shall be looking for another pair this year to take me on a trekking vacation.. ahhh GEOX...$$Liked and shared. I should win as I am a big fan of GEOX especially because of its  technological innovation and Italian style. Geox's footwear exemplifies this style and innovation, thanks to original designs and exceptional breathability. In Geox shoes and boots, a patented system consisting of a microporous membrane placed on top of a perforated rubber sole allows heat and humidity to escape from my feet, and keeps the shoes fresh and comfortable all day. :D Despite this enhanced breathability, many Geox shoes and boots remain waterproof and that's crucial living in Singapore where it can rain anytime anywhere! :)$$Liked & Shared! I wish to win this because a pair of waterproof boots is important to me as I love to explore places with wet terrain and not to mention that my feet would be able to breathe in them too!$$like and shared. would like to win a pair of winter boots for upcoming trip in New Zealand! heard that GEOX boots are light and comfortable!",0,0,2,0,0,0,,,,,,

The Oblation is a statue of a naked man – the icon of the University of the Philippines. And every year, one of the fraternities of the university holds the Oblation Run. It's where neophytes are required to run outside in broad daylight with nothing on, except for a cloth masking their faces and a single, small leaf covering their private parts. It's a highly anticipated event, one which attracts not just eager university students but also the media. 

Fun Fact:
The runners usually hand roses to female spectators.

This is my invention I made a few days ago to fight the governments consistent gang stalking that never stops . The U.S. government use silent sound RF frequencies to hack into your brain and administer mind control threw Tv and radio by using radio frequencies . This is the combination of over 2 and a half years work and building things and frequencies that work and heal the mind and body . I was working with only sound up until a few days ago and now I have built a RF frequency silent sound negative RF protection modulator using the 4 separate sound devices and several frequencies I have compiled that work to shut them out and shut them down for good . I don't have much money and if I did I could build a proper sound silent sound modulator that could be un hackable .Due to lack of funds I am using my computer and that is the biggest down fall of this mechanism because they can hack and piggy back off the media players and distort the frequencies from being how they should be .This could easily be solved with a stereo tuner and multiple sound devices and a mixer . All these things I do not have .Also with a more powerful transmission device I could heal the planet in a matter of days . Even the radiation from FUKUSHIMA could be healed in a matter of weeks if not days . Rf frequencies effect you on a molecular level and could do the same for water if a powerful enough Rf modulator was built broadcasting the Binural frequency called Radiation detox . Now I know why the U.S. Government takes it down when I put it on line for people to use for free . This frequency kills radiation .This could also be used to kill infected plants and people and The Earth infected with Chem trails and GMO . I am sure of it so please spread the word and please help me in any way you can . Be blessed and walk in the light .

Sounds unrealistic because I have so much loose skin & cellulites all over my body but so much space in my heart to hold love from my kids ❤ but I believe as long as I can dream, I can achieve the impossible!$$My new year's resolution is to spend more time with my kids, explore new countries with them and prepare them for our new life ahead. I am a single mom raising two boys alone. 2017 will be the start of our new lives..

Liked and shared #startAFRESH$$My craziest new year resolution for 2017 is to finally be able to cycle confidentally. This might not seem crazy for others but it is for me. Went to ECP when i was 16 and something happened, something bad. Hoping to overcome my fear and be able to cycle with my mum as she is a avid cyclist :)$$""Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's Maybelline."" - #word really. I don't believe in being born with beauty; I guess you can be born with pretty good features (or not), but beautiful is really a long journey of working hard to refine oneself not just on the inside, but outside as well. 

This year, as I am going to be a 2017 bride, my craziest new year resolution would be to STAY OFF SWEET FOODS. Which is almost impossible because if you looked at my FB and Instagram, you'd know just how integral food is in my life. Not just for survival, nope, it's more than that. It's sustenance for my fun-loving soul 😂😂😂 But since I need to look good for my upcoming wedding and pre-wedding photoshoot, I have to cut down on desserts for good skin and some weight loss. So please be kind and support me in my journey - good makeup is always welcomed! 😉🎉💕 #startAfresh$$My craziest new year resolution is to finally pluck up the courage and determination to learn martial arts! This would open doors to so many new opportunities like travelling independently (safety!), being more active and healthy and finally, meeting new people in Uni! ✈️💪🏻👭👬👫 Will definitely be a tough one to follow through but I'm resolute that I can! And of course, looking fab when I'm not trying to kick ass will be awesome too!$$Craziest new year resolution is to be kinder and better to myself. I spend non working hours for my kids and with my kids, even when i am on leave its all for them , never for myself. This year i will be a bit selfish and create more time for myself, a leaner me, a fitter me and a healthier me!$$My craziest resolution is to do good and pay it forward at least once every month!

Fun Fact: 
You can try dolphin-watching at Puerto Princesa Bay and see if you can spot long-snouted spinner dolphins at play. The best time to go is when the seas are calm.

Calvin Tan$$Cos it's been 5 years since I visited USS!!! Please let me goooooo!!! HAHAAH!!$$liked shared. my friend is crazy about roller coasters so this will be the ultimate thrill ride! Oyhens Bridge$$It's been a very very long time since i last challenge the battlestar galatica !!! ! I hope to win this Fantastic giveaway so that i can bring my bff to USS and have a thrilling and exciting new year eve !$$Liked and shared!
I wan to celebrate the new year with my best friends at uss! Me and my bestie did our o lvls this year we are quite nervous of the results which will be released in jan 2017. I also have a bestie who went to ite and due to us seperated, we didnt have time to catch up with one another. We didnt even went out tgt this year due to our busy schedules and important exams. I really wan me and my besties to be able to go out and have fun nd relax and talk abt times where we were still tgt in the same school, same class, talking abt the stupid things which we did tgt etc. I feel that uss is just the right place for it. We nvr been to uss in a longgggggg time. I know that most probably on that day there will be alot of people and the waiting times for the rides will be very long. During that time we can catch up with life and ask one another abt the life we live in now. Like how was school, have any new crush which they like and can tease them abt their crush hehe.. So we will spend the time wisely talking to one another instead of using the phone while waiting for our turn on the rides. And some of the attractions dun even allow u to bring any of your belongings with you! Speaking of those attractions, i also can get to see my friends' reaction on the rollercoasters and i will most probably lmao during the whole ride haha(we sure love to make fun of one another)! XD
 Really hope that i can win the tickets as i wan to bring the girls back tgt to spend a day tgt and to forgot our worries and to escape reality temporarily. (Thanks for taking your time to read this.)$$It'd be wonderful if I am able to go to USS with a precious Friend of mine and share the countdown moment together :) it's been a long way we've both come along and having recently graduated from high school it will be great for us to end this year with each other's company and look back at 12 years of friendship!!$$USS is somewhere every tourist will wanna go. but wait, there's actually singaporeans that haven been there... and thats me! haha main reason is because i cant bear to spend the money bcuz i have fear of heights. time to conquer my fears...... wimmmeeee! <3 Yongda Tan$$Liked and shared this post!

KeKe Xiao Hui$$Because I wanna share this festive season insanity with my besties Kimberly Meagan Ray Yoe and See Toh Jia Xin and taking the battlestar all night long sounds like the best way to do it and it's my favorite ride of course.$$I've never been to a countdown before and I would like to make 2016 special. With all that happened in 2016, ending it in USS with my family would be the best ending that I could I ask for. It's a unique place and also I can only imagine the fun we will all have there!$$Liked & shared! Would love to win this as i want to celebrate with my bf! He is in the army and we have very very limited time. Most of the time when he book out, we spent it with our little girl so it would be great if we could win this so we could have like a day out just the two of us! Haha as parents, all the time are given to our child so hopefully, i'll get to win this so i could take this oopotunity to go on a 'date' w him haha$$I wish to win for my family since school close we only go window shopping nearby..If i win  i can bring them to USS as they been wanting to go.If i am lucky i win i only need to buy for my others kids.Hope i can be one of the lucky winners. join me too Zaidi Aiman Nana Ana Aizat Zaidi$$The Dad of my boy is the most special person in my life. He's the sole breadwinner of the family and always working hard to provide us with what the family wants. He not only will help out in household chores, he also spent time bonding with family. 

He is busy with work but often show his love and concern through little things he do everyday, he would make me honey water everyday before he goes to work and would also make sure the flask is full so that we would have enough water for the day.

I really appreciate everything he has done for the family and would like to surprise him with a trip to USS so he could have some fun and enjoy on the NYE!!$$Liked and shared post!
I would like to win this as it is really special to have a countdown party in USS, USS is also one of my favourite place and furthermore I love all the exciting rides there. Some rides are open all night long which means I can ride in the dark and it will definitely be extraordinary experience for me!
Thanks for this awesome giveaway!$$Liked and shared! 

I want to win this pair of tickets as my bf and i are really enthusiasts of amusement parks.  I hope to spend the day counting down with him in a place that both of us have never visited, together. It would definitely be a first and super memorable as we chat about our resolutions and enjoy the night lights at USS and ride together!
Please make my wish come true!!! ☆☆☆ We would of course post lots of pictures too!!! 
Thank you :)$$Hello Smart Local. I am someone that lives for such cheap (ok la USS very expensive for students like me) thrills. So getting the opportunity to get on rides at 1.30am would be the best thing that'll ever happen to me in 2016. Besides that, NYE was never celebrated in my whole 19 years of existence. I'm considered 'too young' by my parents and I'm not allowed to club or start my year with a bang bc not halal. Hence, my parents would actually support the idea of me celebrating New Years getting 'mabuk' (drunk/dizzy in Malay) on rollercoaster rides than on vodka or beer. So, this is my shot at winning them tickets. 😬$$Liked and shared! I wna win this coz i have been staying at home to countdown for the past few years.... I have no plans for this year's countdown as usual but really hope that I could celebrate the new year in USS this year!!! If not my last day of the year will be as boring as other years... :($$Liked and shared.
I really hope to win this so that I can bring my parents along, they have never been to USS nor hardly any other attractions cos of their working life from morning till night. I hope i will be able to make their new year more enjoyable and give them some time off to enjoy like they deserved. :')$$Liked and shared.

I hope to win the tickets as 2016 is really really a bad year. Hoping to get a spin on a roll coaster shout out to welcome 2017 (hoping it can be a better year)

Most importantly, to spend time and fun with loved ones on such an rare chance on their special opening hours :)$$Why I want to win? Are you kidding me??? It's like a childhood dream come true to stay overnight in a theme park!! Just hope I won't turn into Princess Fiona when the clock strikes 12! Haha!$$Keeping my fingers crossed that I will win as it will be a special unique night to spend new years eve at USS!!! Never had such a night experience before and definitely will be one to remember for years!! Liked and shared$$Liked and shared! Would like to win so I could end my 2016 on a bang by taking all the scream-worthy rides in USS! Besides, what is a better way to celebrate 2016 ending and 2017 starting than creating happy memories with the awesome shows and cute mascots? I would also like to watch the fireworks and be a part of the countdown party!",0,0,0,1,0,0,,,,,,

Please PM us with your Full Name, email address, and last 4 digits of your NRIC :)$$At IMM, there're just so many outlets to choose from, that I'm so spoilt with choices! One of the outlet store that I really look forward in IMM is the Owndays outlet store. I've just gotten back to school and have been studying too much that my vision has definitely deteriorated. With just 20 minutes of waiting time, I can afford to put my books aside while getting my glasses fixed! :)$$Outlet By Club 21 for me. As a teen that's also working in sales, we're constantly under pressure to look good, professional AND still be stylish. It's a tall order, on top of having to manage all of that with a tight leash on our wallets. But Outlet manages that by slashing steep discounts on items that would normally be waaayy out of our range. Heck, its even better than Carousell coz we get to try the items out before paying. Thumbs up for this article that gave IMM some shine on their stores!!!$$Liked and shared this announcement☆★☆
Wish to win this for my birthday on 17Dec ☆★☆
Like both TheSmartLocal.com and IMM outlet mall  I love shopping at IMM and always look forward to visiting Charles and Keith and Owndays. It's awesome to purchase their items at a fraction of the usual prices, we get lots of savings and we can shop to our hearts' delight.$$My favourite outlet is Timberland outlet as I loves their comfortable leather shoes. 
At their outlet, I can find items for  half the original price; makes a bargain queen like me especially happy when I find a good deal. 
I also like Diaso, its another great place at IMM to shop for cheap stationeries and cookwares

The streets & rivers were narrowed down. Trees were hugely reduced because of population and over developments. If Manila structures base their building designs like of the era gone by, Manila could have a distinct character for foreigners and locals alike to marvel.  Money is not the problem because the businessmen have money.  If the Europeans, Americans and our neighboring Asian countries can do it, why can't we?$$Twy, sometimes I wish I lived there and other times I'm glad I don't.$$ Of course, most Filipinos should know what happened to Bonifacio. Aguinaldo’s men raped Bonifacio’s wife and stabbed Bonifacio. Eventually, they executed him and buried him in Maragondon, Cavite.

Today, the illuminati, or at least part of its principles, is still alive in government. For instance, Benigno Aquino, Sr, the grandfather of Noynoy, and President Manuel Roxas, the grandfather of Mar, were both well-known Freemasons. Noy is still fighting the Church, and he is still making the same mistake as Aguinaldo who asked assistance from American illuminati who will betray Noy in the end. ",0,1,0,2,0,0,attraction,5,,,,

If you don’t know where to go for dinner, why don’t you try Izakaya? It’s getting hot here, so it would be great to have cold drinks after sightseeing all day long!

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/song-seung-heun-saimdangIf you've watched My Princess and dreamt of falling into the hot bodyguard oppa's arms, dream no more. Get passes to meet Song Seung Heon before his new drama drops!","Look, I'm not denying Seung Heon has good looks (just take a look at all the other comments!). In fact I believe he is one of the best-looking actors in the Korean industry. But the point I want to make is, actors should be judged beyond that - whether it is in terms of character, skill, intelligence or personality. To me, Seung Heon exemplifies all these qualities but the thing I value most about him is his craft. His impeccable acting in shows like My Princess, Summer Scent and many others, is unmatched. To be able to be in the presence of such a great actor would definitely be a dream come true.$$Wouldn't want to Miss this Precious Opportunity !!! 

Singtel Slogan : ""Let's Make Everyday Better""  

So this meeting session with Song Seung Heong Oppa would make my year 2017 Everyday Better !!!  🙆$$I have liked and shared.I would love to see Song Seung Heon as he is so handsome and cute.I am a huge fan of him since young.Please give me a chance to win.I beg u.Thank you for organising such a wonderful and amazing giveaway.$$Liked and shared!

I hope to win this n get to meet him.... Praying.... Hope to be the one.... This is the only chance to get close ...😍😍$$Song Seung Hoon's character from Autumn in my heart has become a household favorite in the Philippines when the drama became such a big hit back home. I was nicknamed 'Oppa' (eventhough I'm a girl and they didn't know Oppa is for guys only) by my former colleagues as we used to binge watch My princess at work so, I guess it's a huge priviledge to meet him in person.$$Omg Janis Tan I hope one of us gets to see him in real life and no longer a dream for us! We were just talking about summer scent drama and I saw this on fb!! Participate too please!!$$Liked and shared! I wanted to win because ever he came to Singapore I didn't have chance to go see him due to school exam.

He's also sooooo goodlooking 😍 I'm also a big fan of his acting - loved his cold yet thoughtful character in My Princess and his aloof character in Obsessed (He looked SO GOOD in the military wear!😍). I also think he has a very distinct style of delivering his lines when acting, which I love because that's his charm so I want to hear and see him for myself in person!$$Liked and shared!!

I would love to win because he is the first oppa whom I liked when I watched the Korean drama ""Autumn in my heart"" and I would really love to meet him in person! ❤️$$I only knew Seung Heun oppa better after watching My Princess. He's got great personality and a pretty girlfriend 😘 I'm quite late to the crowd when it comes to falling for his charms, but all I want to do is just to have a photo taken with him because you don't always see him out and about, so I hope to win.$$OMG!! I have been waiting to see him since autumn in my heart.... FINALLY! A chance .

Rod Fai has a new sister market Rod Fai II near the Thailand Cultural Center MRT - a huge relief to everyone because it is literally in the heart of the city. You no longer have to go through a painful 30-45 mins taxi ride to get there like before. And LOCALS come here. 

Visiting Rod Fai is very different experience from those just used to going to Chatuchak. It has FASHION, FOOD and BARS all lined up next to each other. But even this market is different from the old Rod Fai Market. 

We highly recommend Singaporeans to go here to avoid the other tourists and lepak with locals. Check out all the street food we ate!

Ah, Boracay. Need we say more? Since much has been said, raved and written about this famous four-kilometer stretch of powder white sand paradise, we would like to suggest you try the most exhilarating activity off it — cliff-diving at Ariel's Point. The highest plank is about 15 meters high, which is as high as a five-storey building. But a jump off it ends with a safe, pleasantly wet landing.

Fun Fact: 
Not a lot of people know that Tribal Adventure Day Tours are offered on this island. These are no ordinary tours. You spend an entire day getting to know the indigenous people living In the area.

Shichi-go-san is a traditional ceremony to celebrate the healthy growth of children.
Celebrations are carried out on November 15th for boys who reach the age of 3 or 5, or for girls who turn 3 or 7 years old. The custom is for the children to dress in their best clothes and to carry Chitose-ame which are long thin candy sticks colored in red and white, believed to bring good luck.
Since Nov. 15th is not a national holiday, many people visit the shrine on near weekend.
When you visit shrines on the weekend of Oct. to mid Nov., you may encounter cute girls and boys who wear traditional kimono!

Jagannatha Temple is one of the four most sacred places in India. The temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna or Jagannath and has three main deities namely; Lord Jagannatha, Goddess Subhadra and Lord Balabhadra. According to legends, Puri is the birthplace of Lord Vishwakarma. It is believed that Lord Vishwakarma and Lord Vishnu (disguised as a carpenter) had helped to construct the temple.

Zambales, Luzon

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Zambales from Caloocan or Cubao (seven hours).

What is it?
In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

The series of protruding limestone formations unique to Palawan make the province home to lakes as well. These lakes are formed when water is trapped in the spaces in between the limestone cliffs.

Don't be deterred by the urban jungle known more commonly as Manila but venture out to the islands.  I definitely developped a soft spot for Palawan and Siargao.  Accommodation:  like any county it knows the good, the bad and the ugly but usually the prices are reasonably (particularly when compared to anything we have here in Western Europe) and the service (this is definitely something I have come to love about the Philippines) is excellent.     One thing though for us poor buggers stuck in the Eurozone:  the Euro has taken a nosedive.

Simpy fill in the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LC9PSXD and put yourself in the running for the vouchers!$$My favourite and the most common one which everyone probably know about is the McDonald's one! :D They have this Create Your Taste digital touchscreen kiosks and when it first launched, i think its really cool because you can customise your own burgers at your own convenient since the kiosk is self-service. The pictures of the food they show on the kiosk makes the experience even better too. :)$$At our recent Sakae Sushi buffet, we are allowed to use only the Ipad to order our food.After ordering our food, me and my friends were so busy eating and talking till we did not notice my little cousin pressing and ordering alot of other random stuffs from the menu. We only know about it when we start to question each other on who ordered this and that. Everyone denied and so we just keep eating till one of us saw my little cousin continuously pressing the menu for fun. Everyone stared at my little cousin whom gives us a cute little smile and giggle which melted all our anger. Thank god it is a buffet session which prevent us from screaming at the bill upon checking out. Phew!$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was my first time eating in Genki Sushi. This is because I enjoy the moment when the train comes to deliver the order you have placed on the ipad. I thought that is a very smart of Genki Sushi to deal with the rising business cost and labour crunch with this creative way of using tech to place and deliver order. The train has brought back a lot of fond childhood memories and i feel like a child again <3$$McDonald's Surprise Alarm App is a great way to have fun and get good deals at McDonald's! My family often accumulates vouchers to redeem at our weekly Sunday lunch there! Recently, I went to the counter with three different handphones to redeem vouchers. The staff were very nice but slightly bemused at the number of vouchers being redeemed. It got so bad that when I decided to add on a hot coffee at the end (cos paiseh), the staff asked if I would be paying for that or if I had a voucher for it too! Just one of the things that Singaporeans are willing to do for food I guess!$$Actually my first tech moment of dining was in most japan's casual restaurant whereby they have these vending machines like thingy which has lots of small pictures/names of the food that you would like to order. Select the food, pay, receive a coupon, go to the counter and hand in the coupon, moments later your food will arrive! ( definitely easier for tourist like us who don't know how to speak jap! ) If not we might have to scream/shout random stuff like him. Hahaha!$$The best/funniest dining moment was when our Creative Director treated us to a near fine dining experience at Oso (Bukit Pasoh). It was an impromptu lunch date, and we were all kind of under-dressed for the occasion. When the food arrived, we were also unsure whether we should instagram the dishes presented, but still went ahead after reassured that we can do so. Other stuffs like etiquette and other stuffs made the dining experience a nervous and hilarious one. The service at the restaurant was however very helpful and didn't make us feel too awkward.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lZiu9vXhX/$$My favorite is Korean barbecue at Kimchi Korean Restaurant because of its built-in electric table grills used without the emission of smoke. It is so good for diners like me who dislike smelling like barbequed meats. :) Liked!$$Dining at Genki Sushi always gets us excited as its really enjoyable to watch it come to us or goes by, it is a great distraction from the waiting time, and it captures attention which brings our group's attention to the same thing, instead of to each respective's phone. It's a great conversation starter which we truly enjoyed, which is why my friends and I loved dining there when we gather. 

I like how technology is changing the way we dine, even mcdonalds at Changi airport has a kiosk for you to order before you get to the counter, and this actually helped the kitchen prepare food in advance while the counters process it. This way the queues move faster and more efficiently. The funniest was when my friend and I was at McDonald's when I ordered my food and went to the counters. It was almost my turn to collect but my friend was still struggling with the kiosk as she did not know how to operate it. She rejected help from me as she wanted to learn as I couldn't always baby her. I end up standing at the sauce counter beside the machine, munching on my fries and waited for her to finish fumbling with the machine. By the time she got her order, I was halfway done with my fries.$$I dined at Genki Sushi before and used Ipad to place order while plain water was self service. The sushi train arrived at our table pretty quick and the process is amusing that we took video of it! We are all adults but we cheered when the train comes and kept guessing which one is ours. This makes the waiting time invisible because it was fun! And nope, nobody was attached to their phone too!$$Loved the bullet train at Genki Sushi where the iPad ordered food will be transported from the kitchen! My friends and I will go boo when the train pass by us. And I'm always so tempted to grab the food from others' train to see their reaction. Of course, I never did it (I definitely don't want to walk out of the restaurant with a bruised face). 

Haha, they should invest in a longer train or a double-decker train as only 3 plates can fit onto one train. ""Choo! Choo!""$$Was at a bak kut teh shop at Plaza Singapura. My dining companions pull out a tablet from their side of the table to order food. I tried looking for the tablet on my side and no success. Felt a bit silly. Only then did we realise they only have one tablet per table. Chey!$$As a regular Macdonald patron, I guess one of the funniest moment is when I forgot to swipe my Macdonald's alarm when I redeem the voucher. And when the counter staff checks my phone, I showed her the voucher that was not being swiped. As she instructs me to swipe again, I was shocked and my face flushed radish red as I stared at my feet, so that no one would notice how embarrassed I was... I guess I'd have to stop patronizing the same Macdonald outlet due to this incident. But nonetheless, this is some of the cheap thrills that I have experienced :')$$Remembered dining at tampines 1 at Shin Sapporo ramen, and we had to order the ramen through the tablet. We waited for quite sometime before our food arrived but it was a good experience trying to let customers order themselves :) however some features couldnt be done through the tablet like ordering extra noodles so improvements could be made :)$$My favourite ""dining with tech"" moment was the time when i went to Sakae Sushi. Hahahha. It was really funny. I guess it was a few years back and i still remember it deeply. It was our first time going there after working on a project about Sakae Sushi. So... We went there like mountain turtle ! Like... The first time we saw an iPad. So us being us, the typical ""sua ku"" kids, we found it damn cool to order through the iPad. So ALL OF US are fighting over trying to order the food through the belt. Like all those appetizers etc, we even ordered sushis without even looking at the belt. We fight to order and ordered hell lot of food, then as more and more came, we all can no longer finish up the food... In order to clear the food, we end up playing stupid games to clear up ALL of the food that we ordered ! It was fun, and indeed a ""filling"" day. I miss those times with my friends though

Liked and shared$$Dining with a special table that has a order screen to click what u want. And its a 3min waiting time to countdown and there when u open the present box kind of opening box at the side of the table . Each dishes will be serve. And in every dishes there is this notes and quotes which is rly interesting and some times hilarious one 😂😂 damn cool and can be found in one restaurant at london 😍😍 my favourite.$$I was dining at a small restaurant at a ski resort in Korea in the winter, and I ordered a bowl of cheese ramyeon. As usual, I would take a photo of my food before eating it. However, my hands were so cold from the snow that when I wanted to take a photo of my cheese ramyeon, the camera slipped out of my hand and, well, into hot soup literally. For the rest of the day, my camera lens fogged up and I couldn't really take any more pictures :/ Luckily, the cold temperatures of the winter helped to clear up the fog in my lens by the end of the day.$$Tried to order my beef bowl at Yoshinoya @ 313 using the iPad/kiosk. After 5 repeated entries, I made another manual order at the counter. The kiosk didn't work at all! Genki sushi is really impressive. Whenever a train is passing by, I have the urge to hijack the train and grab the cabin. Haha.$$Taking out both mine and my sis' phone to snap foodie photos and tilting the dishes and positioning them here and there, shifting myself left and right, retaking those photos using different phones just to get that best shot... ""Are you done yet!!!"" my sis will be showing that face, irritated cause I just wasted a few minutes of her life to enjoy food.$$You know how your friends always stop you from eating just to snap some photos to share online and as once my friends took so long that I got so sad watching the food go cold so while they were editing the images I took my ""revenge"" by eating one entree all by myself ahaha! ORRBEEGOOD!$$Fish and Co has all the promotions on the ipad so no need to worry missing a deal,You can even have it without sauce or Whole Grains too.$$Cassandra Chew bringing own black cloth, props & utensils out to take pimp up food, placing them on chairs & sometimes standing on them. Phone cameras out & flash on - all for that instaworthy shot, at the mere expense of being judged at even a foodcourt. & it's worth it 😂$$when your phone drops into that bowl of soup cuz you were trying to get a good shot of it! there goes the phone and your soup. heh. :)$$My best dining moment is at Emporium Shokuhin – Singapore’s 1st Integrated Japanese Emporium with 8 Dining Concepts!  My personal favourite is TSUKERU. The smell that diffused from this shabu shabu outlet sent me salivating everytime I visit it. I get to indulge in my own hotpot of soul warming soup, with choices between local-style soup bases such as tom yum, bakkuttehand tomato, or Japanese ones such as konbushoyu, miso and tonkotsu. So yummy! It's the most unforgettable dining moment.$$There's this place where you pick what food you want, and it get delivered to you like a speed train on a conveyor belt after the chef has finished your order.",2,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,

Dear Japanese Friend
It is My Privilege to Read My Message, Carefully to the End;

I am a Final Year Medical student, and have got the highest Score in Comprehensive Exam of Medical Basic Sciences, and the Highest Score in Physics and Mathematics, on the University Entrance Exam, Between All University’s Students. (Despite in My Entrance exam, Electricity was cut off, and there was No Coolers and No Lights!).

I have Prepared the Most Comprehensive Theory, in the field of Athletic Success Secrets.
My Theory, is the Result of 17 Years of Onerous Scientific Researches. 
All Aspects of My Design, were Built According to the Strict Rules and Certain Principles of Physics and Mathematics (Sure Sciences), not any worthless ideas or False beliefs, or Even Possibilities Like Internal Medicine!
Unfortunately, in my country, Government Officials don’t welcome science. They didn’t provide for me Even a Simple Conference, to hear Even the Nature of My Plan, or at Least the Core of The Most Logical Scientific Project in Sport’s History.
That’s Why I Couldn’t to Make any Global & Historically Valuable Innovative Records yet!
So, Since You're the Host of the Tokyo 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES, and Besides I have a Special Respect to the Politely Culture of the Japanese Nation, So I Decided to Present My 1st Conference (My Most Important Conference), in your Country, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
I, along with a Tribute, Just Have a small Request from Japanese Academic and Government Officials ;
Just Prepare for me to Present My 1st Scientific Conference in the JAPAN, IMMEDIATELY.
I do not want any money in Exchange for Giving this Scientific Conference.
But I Wish to Dedicate All the Proceeds of my Conference to the President of JAPAN, to Accelerate Technology as Possible, for the Benefit of your Noble Nation.
Please Read my Letter Carefully (Letter.pdf), And Pass it to your Government Officials, if it is Possible.
Please send this to Headquarter of SONY.

Best Regards
Yours Cordially

In Korean, 'ㅈ' is generally romanized as 'j' and 'ㅊ' as 'ch.' So be careful not to mix up 'chuweoyo' (it's cold) and 'joayo' (it's good). ㅋㅋㅋAny other tips or fun facts for those learning Korean? ","a good site to learn is www.talktomeinkorean.com$$I think the KBS World website has a very good online learning section :)$$This is fun !! Sometimes i do mix up ~~ But now okay already ~~$$@Jan-Louis: Sites are good, but how about sharing something from YOUR experience?*^^*$$I just try and pick things up from the Koreans around me. Wherever I go I ask people what is the word for this or that. Or I ask them what they just said. I suppose another thing that was good for me was to start with the phrases that were useful to me, it makes me more motivated when I can use what I have learnt (things like directions etc).$$Something else that can be confusing is 방금 (banggeum) and 금방 (geumbang). Look it up on Naver if you're curious. ;-)$$I really want to learn korean...so that it will be easier for me to travel korea independently next year$$@Heidi: One of the best things to learn is <<food name, this, that>> + 주세요 (juseyo).$$""래프팅"" and ""번지점프"" are two good words to be able to read in hangeul this summer!$$Thanks for the tip so i know the different now because last time i heard the pronounciation is almost same$$Wow next year me and my friend will visit Korea also on Valentine's day,,$$I don't have hangeul on my computer but the romanization ""place name + odisaeyo"" is useful.

It's even counter productive$$It's actually i am attending Hangul class rite now..and i'm in the process of writting &reading..it's interesting..i hope to continue to the higher level...$$@Matthias: I agree that it's better to learn the Hangeul, but knowing the romanization can be useful for online purposes.^^$$@Angele: That's excellent! What book are they using? The Singapore branch is very active so it's always fun to hear what's going on.^^$$I can read and write Hangeul, but I can't understand the meaning of the word. and I find it hard to build a sentence in Hangeul. T__T Do u have any suggestion??$$My future wife's a Korean. I better pick it up fast so as to communicate with her parents. Any advice as how to greet your in laws?$$They're using their own notes actually. So Korean 1 was more about learning Hangul, and simple conversations (like insahagi, jigeob, gonghangeseo, hoteleseo) whereas Korean 2 focuses on the grammar..

I hated SMRT breakdowns till I went to Australia and had to wait 1 hour for my bus because that's how often they came. When I was stuck in a jam in Bangkok for an hour, I decided getting off and walking would be faster.

Sure, it's very easy to complain about everything, but let's not be that angry Singaporean. Here are 8 facts that'll make you proud to call Singapore home.

http://thesmartlocal.com/read/happy-facts-sgWe Singaporeans love complaining, but there are so many blessings we constantly take for granted. Here are 8 things all Singaporeans should be thankful for!","There's also the efficiency issue. My friend had to wait almost two weeks before his Internet got set up when he moved to Manchester. That sort of nonsense is unheard of here.$$should let S'porean feel to have no electricity for 2 consecutive days and water$$Some Singaporeans are just not thinking realistically, expecting everything in Sg to be perfect...including our standard of governance.  Would we be here talking about these things if they are so lousy?. They may not be perfect but to be fair, aren't that bad. Might I ask who else can do it better than them presently?
Many have travel and seen the world yet can't do a real comparison between us and other countries ....sad!$$Yes!
I told my mom when trapped inside mrt train last year... she thought i must be angry but i just told her better than when i was in Bangkok anyway, it was like hell over there. 3hrs trapped in mrt is better than living in terrible Bangkok!$$Probably im the only Singaporean that doesnt complain. Been to Malaysia and Indonesia, thank God im lucky to be born In Singapore ❤$$44 deg heat with no air con in an old car in australia...Singaporean need to experience this once in their lifetime and they'll never complain about traffic again! Lol$$All is so true Singapore is just spot on$$Try driving in Jakarta's rush hour :)$$Why compare with Bangkok when you can compare with Japan ? If you want to compare with bkk, why not other things like affordable housing, cars, pace and cost of living ? If you want to feel good about yourself why stop at bkk? Compare your life with Palestinian ones la!$$True, but if you want to compare the areas which other countries are worse off than Singapore, you also need to compare all the areas which other countries are better off than Singapore. It works both ways.$$30 minutes traffic is not bad. I love the public transportation in Singapore. Nothing compared here in Manila. Imagine going to work on Monday morning and going back home on tuesday early morning due to traffic and flood.$$Singapore's geographic area is also 1/10 of these places. Why not more specific comparisons to cities of similar size and GDP? Maybe Hongkong or Seoul? Albeit our transportation remains the top of the curve in comparison to most major cities in the world, it doesn't make a fair comparison simply in terms of land mass.$$We are still using ADSL mind you....one big difference between Sg and oz was the ""speed"" of the internet here. I reckon my grandpa could ran quicker than loading a page in Oz! Lolll$$Well, the next time a Singaporean minister embarrasses the nation by comparing other countries unfavourably to us, let's not jump on him or her then yeah?$$Sawadee Jao. We welcome you to come to Bangkok to see our jam. Singaporean very lucky. Jam in aircon bus, even must stand is still comfort. In Bangkok, jam in bus no aircon, and no place for sit, and bus start-stop-start-stop and very hot chiphai. 
Singapore also have very good data network when jam have Line for chat with friend. Bangkok data not fast same Singapore.

Why Singaporean complain I don't know. Why Singapore make so many road toll for make driver pay, so no jam, I also don't know. 

I think Singaporean all must come Bangkok visit see jam and experience.

Come, visit Bangkok. Spend your money in our Chatuchak so Thai economy can be boost same Singapore always every year improve. 
Come support our industry in the day time and the night time for Thailand take care you from when you wake up to when you sleeping and even when you sleeping we have way to take care you.$$Their cars are cheaper.

Hope you are not yet at the stage where you need positive singapore facts! x$$Opportunity cost is higher in sg with such hectic lifestyle that we live in.$$The geographical , demographic and econmoics are ways too different to make comparison.$$We must learn to step out of our hermit shell and start to appreciate the things around us.$$Please tell 30% nuts in Singapore 🇸🇬!

The resort was amazing, but what really got us excited was the activities around the island. We explored Bouma National Park on Taveuni Island, flew drones everywhere and learnt so much from our hiking guide. Definitely worth a visit!

The best part is that Fiji Airways is having a sale from SGD 749 for adults! The promotion runs from 16 Jan - 31 October, 2017 and there are NO blackout dates!

It reveals a great diversity of diving and a real sense of the pioneer spirit. As an indicator of biodiversity, the bay has 4 species of turtle: Green, Hawksbill, Pacific Ridley and Leatherback, as well as much sought-after marine mammals such as dolphins and dugongs. In Cendrawasih Bay you’ll find that whale sharks will come and stay around in pods and you can swim along with them. All in all, those facts makes the Cendrawasih region as a remarkable dive destination for large animals, small animals, beautiful reefs bursting with life and historical World War II wrecks.

2 * Do you think she is an ambassador of the Korean culture?

My answer

Yes the k-pop is a real an ambassador of Korean culture in its image and at the same time, and I see that the k-pop and would become a true spokesman for South Korea in the world because it represents and this Korean culture with the language of music into the hearts of all enthusiastic in the world is like a wave in western culture as South Korea, like me in Algeria.

K-pop as if the spirit of Korean culture that mixes always between the rich history and pride today

3 * Do you think it represents the country well in the morning light?

My answer is

Yes it is indeed the land of the morning light, the k-pop wreaked havoc far beyond the borders of South Korea boucoupes of rasions among them:

This music and dynamic as South Korea, which is a very dynamic time

Additional

She and Hangul Hangul and is the voice of the land of the morning light.

And she is a world music with excellence. And if Having conquered Asia and North America, K-pop was not hard to seduce the public in Europe and Africa.

4 * Is it a good thing for Korea or not?

My answer is

If yes beautiful in Korea because with the k-pop South Korea has come easily to occupy the hearts of many young people and adults in all corners of the world is the language of music.
And indeed the k-pop and now compete with American pop and I'm sure he'd be the vanquished without a doubt, and if everything is safe thanks to the global strategist of the k-pop Setting up and use of the Internet and the marketing method and Travel abroad

Until now, it was necessary to perform the tax-free procedure each time for every one store visited. But in the new system, tax-free procedure can be combined with the goods purchased in multiple stores, such as within shopping streets.

Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5, 001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10, 001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district. 

It would be a pleasure to introduce Okayama City as the first shopping spot in Japan where you will have this new Tax-free system benefit.
At the tax-free stores in Omotemachi Shopping Street and Romantic-dori Shopping Street, you may purchase Japanese traditional sweets, tea utensils or Japanese tea, and then operating procedure tax refund at the tax-free counter of Tenmaya department store. You will be able to get the benefit and also you may enjoy authentic Japanese Tea in your home country.

Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) and Sicogon Development Corporation (SIDECO) will launch Sicogon Island Tourism Estate development within the first half of 2016.

The ALI-SIDECO joint venture is expected to drive economic progress in Western Visayas and the entire region as it serves as a tourism hub for surrounding or nearby destinations like Gigantes, Bantayan and Concepcion islands.

The 1,100-hectare Sicogon Island will feature a balanced mix of developments, such as a resort town center, hotels and resorts, as well as commercial and residential establishments, supported by an on-site airstrip.  The ground breaking of the airport runway is scheduled for the second half of the year.

“The initial development will concentrate on building the airport and runway, to ensure accessibility to the island,” said Jose Emmanuel Jalandoni, ALI Senior vice president and group head of commercial business.  “The 1.3-kilometer runway will allow immediate access from Manila and Cebu to the island development,” he added, saying further that test flights to Sicogon are being targeted for the first quarter of 2017.

The project is supported by public, private and community organizations, and government bodies alike because of the potential economic benefits it will bring to the region.  A framework agreement was signed by ALI, SIDECO, and the Federation of Sicogon Island Farmers and Fisherfolk Association (FESIFFA) in 2014 to pave the way for the sustainable development of Sicogon Island.  The group has been assisting the local community through skills training and livelihood programs to make them active partners in the development.

“We strongly believe and hope that poverty alleviation will be achieved through tourism projects.  These will give us various job opportunities and help us improve farming and fishing methods,” said Raul Ramos, president of FESIFFA.

Jalandoni stressed that sustainability will be a main focus of the project.  Aside from allocating more than 50% of the development for open green space, ALI will also work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to continue stewardship of Sicogon’s forested area, and work on coastal protection and marine life rehabilitation in support of sustainable development.

“More than becoming a premier tourist destination and a tourism hub for the region, Sicogon is envisioned to provide inclusive growth and economic development through long-term recovery and livelihood programs, and job creation,” said Jalandoni.

ALI estimates that the Sicogon Island development will provide 20,000 jobs either directly or indirectly with increased tourism, and approximately P1 billion in earnings for the community through business opportunities that will come from the retail and commercial establishments.

If you are in Korea, you can buy a ticket for 5000 won.

I think the organizers want to help foreign ppl buy tickets but don't have the manpower or foreign language abiltity (usually concert organizers dont even seem to consider overseas guests), so they contacted agencies abroad, and those agencies are selling for a profit at market price.

If you want, I can buy a ticket and take your daughter.

Marie$$(also, there are many cases of ppl buying cheap tickets and then selling them expensively online, so I think these restrictions are intended to prevent that)

Do you have a similar celebration your country? Let us know! 👇
For those who are new, learn more about #chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) in our article here ☞ bit.ly/2cc8fIA ","Happy  Chuseok, In my State Karnataka,India, we have a harvest festival festival it is called Sankranti and we have family together also we do perform ancestor worship or paying homeage to our ancestors,,, but all this done in different months$$Chuseok is originally known as hangawi ""the great middle of autumn"",is a major harvest festival in KOREA, 
Like many other harvest festivals around the world,it is held around the autumn .
Harvesting preparation
Nabanna (New Crop) is a Bengali harvest celebration usually celebrated with food and dance and music in Bangladesh and in the Indian State of West Bengal. It is a festival of food; many local preparations of Bengali cuisine like pithe are cooked and offered.

The festival is celebrated with mela which are called nabanna mela. It is one of the numerous festivals that gave the name ""baro mase tero parban"" (thirteen festivals in twelve months ) to the land of Bengal. Although the nabanna parban is somewhat different from other ones since it is not connected to a religion such as Ratha Yatra. The villagers and locals from both the major religious groups join the festival with equal participation. There are also several fertility rituals which make the festival truly a harvest ritual. The festival gets a lot of support from the creative army of Bengali culture. Several poets, musicians, baul and painters flock to such mass gatherings. There is a famous play written on nabanna by Bijon Bhattacharya which depicts the sad incident of the great Bengal Famine of 1943.[1] Nowadays the Festival ""Nabanna"" is celebrating every Bengali year (1st day of Agrahayan) in Dhaka, organized by Jatiya Nabanna Utshab Udjapan Parshad (National Harvest Festival committee) since 1998. Mr. Shahriar Salam is main planner of the organization. There are huge number of cultural activists, organizations & performing in a day long festival. Traditional Dance, Song & Rally arranging by the Committee. Once upon a time 1st Agrahayan was the first day of Bengali New Year. It is a non communal festival in Bengal.

Below is a description found in west Bengal on one such mela website.

""people from several villages of Howrah and even from other districts of West Bengal come here. People not only come to visit the Mela. In addition, they participate in many cultural programmes and competitions like 'Pithe Making' (Preparation of different sorts of Bengali Cakes), Seat-and Draw, Senior Citizens' Walking Competition etc. An ""Art-Camp"" may attract creative minded people where artists from different states will participate. Some rare items of rural Bengal as ""Dhenki"" (Old-style Domestic Rice Mill), paddy of different varieties directly from the farmers' house are to be exhibited in the Exhibition ground. You can taste some delicious Bengali dishes like Pati-sapta, Payesh (the latest addition is 'Vegetable Payesh'), Jilipipi (not Jilipi) etc. during the festival. Bengal's time-honoured culture and heritage will be presented to you in forms of Baul song, Chhou-dance, Jatra, Tarja, Kobi-gaan, etc. These artists come from different parts of the state to perform their talent and expertise in front of thousands of appreciative gatherings. Moreover, you can refurbish your collection of folk arts from the 'exhibition-cum-sale' stalls of handicrafts made by rural artisans.""[2]$$추석 잘 보내세요~~~
I think the closest thing we have to chuseok is EIDs ..there is plenty of food and plenty of relatives visiting ..  elders give money to youngsters which is similar too .. the only thing is that the money thing is related to eid-al-fitir while the food thing is about eid-al-adha .. but similar both of them 😁$$I'm from Saudi Arabia, I think you saw the Hajj in mekkah Snapchat story, it ends with a big celebration, in the last month of the hijry islamic year <3$$Hello, I am so happy to let you know about the Chuseok in my country, Vietnam ^^
It is said that originally, the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival came about as a way for parents to make up for lost time with their children after harvest season. The harvest was done by September, (August in the Lunar calendar) and the parents were anxious to spend time with their children and do something special with them, as well as celebrate the harvest, after spending much time working hard and away from the family. It was held under the full moon, which represents fullness and prosperity of life.

Tet Trung Thu is very much like a combination of our Halloween and Thanksgiving. Children parade on the streets, while singing and carrying colorful lanterns of different sizes. Some of the popular shapes include fishes, stars, butterflies and a lantern that spins when a candle is inserted, representing the earth circling the sun.

Dances are also traditional, and include the dragon dance and the flower dance.

It is customary to give Banh Trung Thu, boxes of moon cakes, which are traditionally very rich in taste. The cakes are filled with lotus seeds, ground beans and orange peels and have a bright yoke in the center to represent the moon.

Today, the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, as well as encouraging affection for children, promotes education, poetry, dance and arts and crafts.$$Today, we celebrate Trung Thu (Mid-Autumn Festival) in Vietnam too.

They do this to fend off predators by creating a ""confusion effect,"" where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

Fun Fact: 
Shoaling is different from schooling. Shoaling is when a group of fish are grouped close together, but are swimming independently. Tubbataha has 600 species of fish that either school or shoal.

Lake Balinsasayao, Negros Oriental

What is it?
Lake Balinsasayao is a crater lake that's the result of decades of rain. It rests on the Cuernos de Negros mountain range 918 meters above sea level. Trekking up the mountain offers a spectacular view of the lakes, and of the neighboring islands of Cebu, Bohol and Siquijor.

Fun Fact:
Lake Balinsasayao is actually made up of twin lakes that are separated by a thin ridge. You can kayak on these lakes, and even have a picnic next to them.

Olu Deniz, a beautiful inland bay that stretches behind the cape, is now closed to yachts. The reason this heavenly place is called Olu deniz (""Sea of the Dead"") is attributed to the following legend;

Once a father and son were caught in a storm here and were in danger of sinking. The son claimed that if they approached the rocks ashore they could take shelter in a cove. The father on the other hand asserted that their ship would be driven onto the rocks and break up and that there were no coves around here anyway. In his terror of running around on the rocks, the father knocked his son (who was at the helm) into the sea with an oar and took over the helm himself. Just as the ship was about to hit the rocks on the cape, she turned into this calm, smooth watered bay. 

This is the reason they say the bay is called the Sea of the Dead, whereas what with the pine clad sandy beach stretched out like a tongue, the name ""Paradise Bay"" would be more fitting.

The Blue Lagoon of Olu deniz has calm, crytal clear waters which makes it ideal for a variety of water sports and a very safe place for children to swim. Part of the lagoon is now a protected area (and it`s a national park).

Yoi-yama (Festival Eve), all floats with lighted lanterns are exhibited on the Shijo- Karasuma Area, is held on the evening from July 14th to 16th, and also from July 21st to 23rd. 
Not many people know about Byobu Matsuri (Displaying folding screen). During the festive period, from July 14th to 16th, the old textile merchant homes open up the entrance area of their homes or shops once a year. This would be an absolutely great opportunity.

Samar, Visayas

What is it?
A province in the eastern portion of central Philippines, Samar is gifted with rich topography. Mountains, hills, valleys and plains cater to the trekker, while deltas, rivers, beaches and sandbars that come out only during low tide are reserved for the laidback traveler.

Fun Fact:
If you find yourself standing on Homonhon Island in Samar, you’re at the very spot where Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan stood in March 16, 1521, when he discovered the Philippines.
