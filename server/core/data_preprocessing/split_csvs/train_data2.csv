How To Get There:

What is it? 
In Batangas, divers aren't the only ones who are in for a treat. Seafood enthusiasts are too. Have a taste of tawilis, a freshwater fish found nowhere else in the world. It's best served with beer.  

Fun Fact: 
Batangas is considered by most linguists as the seat of Tagalog (the most popular of the Filipino dialects). One Tagalog word that has made it in the dictionary: boondocks.

It is located halfway through Panglao along its coast facing the Bohol Sea. It is a sprawling property which covers 16 hectares. The topography of the resort is diverse. It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

This thought has always intrigued me, mostly because of the sense of appreciation for each. When it comes to experiences, we tend to only understand their importance in the long run. In the moment, we can of course enjoy them. However we may not be able to fully absorb their effect on us until much later on. On the other hand, materialistic belongings have their biggest value when first acquired. Like your mobile phone, for instance. The prized possession you couldn't take your eyes off of the day you brought it home, but has since become just another thing you have, and use. This is what propelled me to start traveling this past year, and I haven't looked back.

""As a filmmaker, photographer and avid traveler, I aspire to inspire through my work, both from my home base in the U.S. and around the globe.

""From the electric blue waters and lush palm forests, to the generous and heartwarming locals, there's no place quite like The Philippines. Having the opportunity to travel here and become immersed in its charm is an experience I cherish.""

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn‚Äôt a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 ‚Äî known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It‚Äôs only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They‚Äôve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

This uninhabited island is about 3 hours away from Singapore (2 hours drive to Mersing and thereafter, a 45 minutes boat ride to the island) and a great place to watch the giant leatherback turtles come ashore to lay eggs yearly, especially so during the month of July.

Batu Batu is a private island boutique resort built in the Malay vernacular architecture, consisting of 20 one bedroom and 2 two bedroom villas. For more information, do visit their resort link below:

Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.


Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name ‚ÄúBantayan sa Hari‚Äù (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to ‚ÄúBantayan,‚Äù the name it's known as today.

The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) is the premiere showcase of the arts in the country. Founded in 1969 under the Marcos regime, it still continues to hold the most celebrated and award-winning plays from around the world. At night, it's therapeutic to watch the fountain lightshow ‚Äî a colorful oasis by the side of the main road, in the middle of a busy metro.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

In the main lobby of the National Theater, you'll notice three large Capiz-shell chandeliers hanging from the third-floor ceiling. They symbolize the three main geographical divisions of the Philippines ‚Äî Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

Chinese communities in Malaysia believe that the gates of Hell open on the 7th lunar month, freeing the spirits of the dead to roam in the world of the living. According to custom, these ghosts can get up to mischief if ignored so all sorts of offerings are made during this period.

Song stages known as getai are set up, Chinese opera and puppet shows held for both the living and the dead. More modern entertainments like karaoke and dance contests are also held on these stages, presumably for the spirits of the more recently deceased.

The Malaca√±ang Palace, Manila

What is it?
Before it became the Presidential Palace, Malaca√±ang Palace was a temporary summer home for Spanish governors and American civil governors.

Fun Fact:
There are several theories as to how the palace got its name. The official story from the 1930s says the name comes from a Filipino phrase which means ""there is a nobleman here,"" because it was originally the home of a wealthy Spanish merchant.""

How to Get There:

Or fly from Manila to Kalibo, then take a bus to Caticlan. 

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.

What is it like?
When packing your bags for Boracay Island, shoes should be the least of your concerns. You'll be walking barefoot on the powder-fine sand most of the time. And sitting on it. And getting massages on it. You'll form quite an attachment to Boracay sand. Just please don't take any of it home! Leave the beach for others to enjoy.

Fun Fact:
Come dusk, young boys and girls take to the beach to begin sculpting impressive pieces of sand art. For a small fee, they can even personalize the sand art for you!

Life, in every form and mood, has been captured in stone, testifying not only to the craftsman's artistry but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose rule the temples were conceived and constructed. 
The Khajuraho temples were built in the short span of a hundred years, from 950-1050 AD in truly inspired burst of creativity. Of the 85 original temples, 22 have survived till today to constitute one of the world's great artistic wonders.

What is it?
On the first day of September, the Filipino Christmas season unofficially begins. Christmas trees and star-shaped lanterns start to fill the streets. Schools start to put together plays about the birth of Jesus Christ. Christmas remixes of the year's most popular songs start to play on the radio. The whole country is transformed for a solid four months. It's the longest Christmas celebration in the world. And it also has a good claim to being the happiest. 

Fun Fact:
Like in most parts of the world, caroling is a common Christmas activity. Adults or children form groups and visit homes at night to sing carols. When given change, young carolers typically sing a thank-you song in Filipino that goes, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so kind, thank you!"" And when they get nothing, the same song takes a different turn ‚Äì ""Thank you, thank you, you're so stingy, thank you!""

The fourth annual Children's Charity Art Auction will be held Sunday, May 16th, at Roofers Cafe and Bar in Itaewon, Seoul. This event brings together art world insiders, collectors, enthusiasts, and artists from a variety of backgrounds to benefit organizations serving children and families in crisis situations. This year, the founders of Children's Charity Art Auction are expanding their donations to include both the Baan Unrak Children's Village as well as the Nalom Village Elementary School. 

AND THEY NEED YOU! 

The first, Baan Unrak, is based in Thailand near the border of Myanmar and provides shelter and education to women and children fleeing the terrible conditions of forced labor and war. These are truly people of survival. See their website at http://www.baanunrak.org/

The second, Nalom Village Elementary School, is an underprivileged, rural elementary school desperately in need of books, teaching materials, and even sanitary drinking water. This small school of 130 students is located in Xaythani District on the outskirts of Vientiane, Laos. We are very pleased to welcome the niece of Nalom's head teacher to this event. This will be the first time this struggling school has ever received aid.

All money raised from this event will go directly to the organizations themselves, and not through an intermediary.

If you are an artist and would like to donate work to the Children's Charity Art Auction, please contact Zach at 010-6629-5254, or at zeichelberger@hotmail.com. This is a great opportunity to network and have your art exposed to a diverse range of patrons. Those interested in being included in our promotional advertising should contact Zach immediately.

One beneficiary from such phenomenon is Kuya Rudy Hecho, a driver and tour guide from Sabtang Island in Batanes, whose story is told by Nethaneel Jao (@thedeafmutespeaks).

""Driving over the steep cliffs of Sabtang Island, Batanes in a cogon-roofed tricycle is probably one of the most memorable moments in my traveling life. Every turn of the road was another breathtaking scenery, and every village, new faces.

""My driver and tour guide, Kuya Rudy Hecho, has been living in Sabtang for as long as he can remember. So much so that he's gotten used to the incredible landscapes that have brought in many tourists for the past years. And in between our cheery conversations about the Ivatan culture and some pointers on common Ivatan courtesies and words, he would tell me how tourism in the island has boomed over the past decade.

""Flocks of visitors would come every month, amazed by the grandeur of Batanes. With his unique and charming cogon-roofed tricycle, he offers guided tours around his home island, as well as accommodations for those who wish to spend the night in Sabtang. With this, he is able to support his family and, at the same time, share with his guests a part of his wonderful culture and the joys of a simple life for them to bring home as priceless memories.

As part of the celebrations under the #VisitPhilippinesAGAIN2016 campaign, the Philippine Department of Tourism in the United Kingdom launched ""The Station Domination Series"" in one of London's busiest train stations, the Waterloo Rail Station.

Starting last 24 April 2016, the first ""Station Domination Series"" features a special immersion zone that gives commuters a feel of the Philippines' beauty and promise of an overall fun experience when they travel to the Philippines. The launch also coincided with one of UK's most anticipated events, the London Marathon 2016.

The ""Station Domination Series"" also gives commuters a chance to win instant prizes and a holiday to the Philippines in three fun ways. One is by taking ‚Äúfoot selfies‚Äù using our floor stickers mapped around the station concourse, second is by taking part in the 3D selfie stand, and third is by experiencing the Philippine islands through a 360 virtual reality pods with photos by photographer Rommel C. Bundalian. 

Apart from the experiential zone, the campaign also features a month-long Philippine branding presence on Europe's largest LED screen found also at the Waterloo Station.

What is it?
Club Paradise Resort is surrounded by a house reef which is easily accessible to divers and has a diverse marine system. Near this reef is the feeding ground of sea turtles and dugongs (sea cows) ‚Äì the gentle giants of the sea. There are tours that take you along the coast of Busuanga for some dugong-watching.

How to get there? 
Fly into Puerto Princesa from Busuanga, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo or Manila. 

Fun Fact: 
Some believe that stories of mermaids came about when lonely sailors spotted dugongs swimming in the ocean, and mistook their shape as that of half-woman, half-fish creatures.

Bulacan is one of the oldest towns in the Philippines. And fishing is among its main source of livelihood. So the city is littered with fishing farms that appear like patchwork from planes. Some farms offer pond fishing where visitors can cook what they catch.

How to get there: 
Take a bus to Bulacan from Cubao or Pasay.

Fun Fact: 
Bulacan‚Äôs name is derived from the word ""bulak"" which means cotton. Named by the Spanish for the region‚Äôs abundance of the plant.

Olango Islands, Cebu

What is it? 
This island group is composed of the main Olango Island and its six satellite islets. The site is a wildlife sanctuary that serves as a pit stop for migratory birds that come from as far as China, Japan and Siberia.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Fun Fact: 
The seven islands of the Olango group are joined together by a continuous reef. This makes the site a nice diving spot as well.

In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

53 Km from Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, one of the principal centers of the Buddhist pilgrimage, is the place where Lord Buddha left his corporeal self and attained Maharparinivana.

Kushinagar was previously known as Kushinagar, which was the capital of Malla dynasty. It was one of the famous sixteen Mahajanpadas of ancient India. The Chinese travelers Fa Hien and Hieun Tsang have also mentioned Kushinagar in their travelogues.

The credit for bringing this ancient site to light goes to General A. Cunningham and A.C.L. Carlleyle who, after excavating the site in 1861, established its antiquity for the first time. Later, between 1904 and 1912, several excavations conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India at Kushinagar confirmed its identity.

The monuments of Kushinagar are clustered in three distinct groups comprising the main site at the Nirvana Temple, the central Stupa and surrounding monasteries, the Mathakuar Kot to the south-west and the Ramabhar Stupa, a kilometer to the east.

Munger district has a unique historical background. The areas falling under this district are considered a part of the first Aryan settlers' midland. It has been identified with Modagiri, a place mentioned in the epic Mahabharat. It was the capital of a kingdom in eastern India near Bhanga and Tamralipta . There is also a mention of Modagiri in the 'Digvijay Parva' of the Mahabharata, which seems to be the same as Modagiri.

The first authentic historical account of the district finds a mention in the memoirs of Xuanzang who visited a part of this district towards the close of the first half of the seventh century AD.

A copper plate known as the 'Munger Plate' was discovered in Munger way back in 1780. Mir Kasim conquered Munger and made it his capital till the army of East India Company captured Munger. MirKasim had to flee through a tunnel made along the bank of river Ganga near Kastharni Ghat.

The magazine‚Äôs bright cover art serves as an invitation for the music icon to come back to the Philippines, and discover that it is truly paradise here! 

The issue also features some of the most influential Filipinos across various industries, and their messages for The Beatles‚Äô famed drummer, to convince him to visit the Philippines again and experience fun in our country.

Grab a copy of the July issue of Esquire Magazine, available in bookstores and newsstands nationwide.

#itsmorefuninthephilippines #visitPH2015 #postcardsfromparadiseAlmost 50 years ago, the Beatles came to the Philippines. Fans packed the Rizal Football Stadium, but the band left the country traumatized by the treatment they got for refusing to make a special appearance at the Palace. It is said that they vowed never to return.

This month, ESQUIRE attempts to change that first impression. Inspired by Ringo Starr‚Äôs new album, Postcards from Paradise, we want to send Ringo a message from this Philippine paradise, with a little help from some of the best and brightest people we know: designer Bea Valdes, musician Armi Millare, literary icon Gilda Cordero-Fernando, broadcast journalist Howie Severino, congresswoman Lucy Torres-Gomez, retail magnate Ben Chan, art fair engineer Trickie Lopa, model Olivia Medina, brothers Romeo and Rox Lee, and VJ Katarina Rodriguez. This all-star cast graces our July 2015 issue, featuring Sgt. Pepper-inspired set built by contemporary artist Louie Cordero.

Inside the issue: 

Oliver X.A. Reyes gives us a blow by blow account of The Beatles' ill-fated 1966 visit to Manila.

Jerome Gomez spends five days in the much-talked about Labor Day bacchanalia‚Äîand comes home alive. 

We send Butch Dalisay to the City of Dreams to gamble away half of Esquire's budget.

All this and more, this month on ESQUIRE Philippines.

It is stated very clearly before submitting reviews that they have to be genuine opinions based on personal experiences. Reviewers are not to have any present or past business relationship with the listings they are reviewing. After an investigation, we have found certain reviews (12 of them for the same listing) do not comply with this, and they have since been unpublished.

If you're affiliated with a business, whether be it their PR / marketing team or business owner - the correct approach is to ""Claim ownership"" on the listing. That way they can update the listing with the latest details and respond directly below any negative reviews. As stated in the terms of conditions, all reviews found to be disingenuous will eventually be removed from the site.

Anilao, Batangas

What is it like? 
Soft corals prefer nutrient-rich waters and less light. They may look like plants, but corals are marine animals that need food. And this type feeds on zooplankton, or organisms incapable of swimming against a current ‚Äì making it the ideal treat for hungry marine creatures. You can find soft corals in Anilao's colorful underwater gardens, which are home to all sorts of tropical fish.

Fun Fact: 
Some soft corals are not actually soft. They're more tree-like and flexible, and can dance gracefully in the waves.

The Simhastha Kumbh is an unrivalled celebration in India. The most popular legend regarding the origin of Kumbh Melas is the Samudra Manthan or 'churning of the ocean'. Gods and demons competed ¬¨ercely in the churning in search of the divine nectar of immortality. During this epic battle to capture the Urn (Kumbh) containing the nectar, drops of the precious liquid fell on four places ‚Äì Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Nashik and Ujjain. Hence, river Kshipra became the enhancer of life and to celebrate this event since then the grand festival came in vogue. Kumbh Mela, is held once every twelve years at these four places and attracts millions of devotees.

Grand Simhastha, on the Ghats of the glorious Kshipra

The Ujjain Kumbh is celebrated when Jupiter ascends into sun sign Leo's quarter or the Simha constellation of zodiac, which is why it is called 'Simhastha'. The Simhastha is special in Ujjain as it is the seat of divine Mahakal - the Lord of all times. The ritual of bathing in the holy waters of Kshipra begins on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (March-April) and continues on various dates until the full moon shows up in the following month of Vaishakha.

Simhastha 2016 will begin on 22nd of April and will continue till 21st of May.

Sadhus of various sects from across the country assemble in Ujjain and mingle with ordinary people as they take their ritual dip in the holy waters of the Kshipra.!

Be a good boy/girl, stay away from this hotel.

This is one of the worst hotel i have ever been to and they have managed to provide me with surprises during my stay here. 

After checking-in, I took my pants off to watch tv in the comfort of my own room. 20 minutes later, a man walked in and i was caught with my pants down, literally. I was eye raped and questioned as he was assigned the same room. It was a breach in security and an invasion of my privacy. What a great way to begin my experience here. 

When wanting to unwind in the bathtub, i sat down and felt something at my bottom. To my horror, it was a little glass bit. speechless.

When wanting to make some coffee for myself, i reached for the teaspoon and felt a sticky spot. The bottom of the spoon still had residues of coffee from previous use. The cleanliness here is appalling.

In the morning, i wanted to order room service breakfast. I was on the phone for half an hour, each ring made me angrier and a hungry man is an angry man. In the end, no one picked up and i had no breakfast. It was 10am when i called by the way, and clearly they were all perhaps trimming the lush bush surrounding the hotel with scissors while my phone call rang away. 

During check out, there was a line and the receptionist exclaimed ""I wish i have more hands!""

________________________________________________________

This evening I delivered the eulogy for my dear friend Subhas at Mandai Crematorium. Here is the full text:

‚ÄúVimala, Sujesh, Friends,
 
All of us offer our deepest condolences to Vimala and Sujesh.
 
Many have said much about Subhas. The outpouring of grief is testimony to the lives Subhas has touched.
 
Why, you can ask?
 
And it's not just the usual explanations,
not just his intellect,
not just his abilities in court,
not just that he had a very big heart,
not just that he had a very big personality.
 
There is something quintessentially Subhas which is all of this and much more. A good person, a noble character and who cared deeply for others and society. When you met him, you felt that about him, that he is a rare person, and you get drawn to him. From the goodness of his heart, a good man who was no one's fool, but always acting in the best interests of his clients and society.
 
We have lost a great man.
It is our loss,
it is our country's loss,
and the country mourns his departure.
 
The media, print, radio, TV, is awash with stories, a testimony to the standing Subhas had.
 
Social media is inundated with condolence messages from all sections of society.
 
Three months ago, we had a tribute event organized by the Association of Muslim lawyers. I was the Guest of Honour.  It was for a fund . Aim was to give ex-prison inmates a second chance in life, named after Subhas. At that event, he spoke movingly of his love for his family and friends in the legal fraternity, and his desire to advance the cause of justice and fair representation. In a way, it has turned out to be a fitting finale for a great lawyer.
 
I met him earlier last year, he was not feeling so good, and he was talking to me about why he is still here. 

By the time September, October came, he was looking much better and we were all hopeful. 

So it was a great shock to hear the news. He has left an indelible mark on the lives of family, friends, and the lawyers of the court. Many people spoke at the AML event and they spoke from their hearts.
 
 To his family, Vimala and Sujesh, Subhas was a loving husband and a loving father who often lamented that he should have spent more time with you. His love for you, Vimala, is expressed from these words he said to you just before he was wheeled into the operating theatre in 2008: ""I see your face in every rose, I see your smile in every cloud.""

Sujesh, your dad is immensely proud of your achievements, and it was one of the proudest moments of his life when you told him of your decision to take up law.

To the legal fraternity, Subhas was like an elder brother. His 40 years of experience in overcoming the odds in court, in cases that had originally seemed to be lost, made him a legend in the criminal bar, his incisive intellect and dogged perseverance were tempered by a sharp wit and infectious sense of humor.

To the people he defended, and the general public, he was a hero.

His reputation for taking up the toughest cases, often pro bono, and then succeeding against odds, made him a mainstay in the news, and a beacon of hope to the accused that he defended.

All this came from his steadfast belief in fair representation and in second chances. He was a fierce and combative champion of these principles and he was never shy in letting me know his views.

I consider Subhas a dear friend and have always found him to be upright, honest, full of integrity and wit. After the October event, he suggested that we have lunch. I agreed, he gave me a date. My diary is run by my PA, I forgot to tell her. At about 12.45pm on a Sunday afternoon, perhaps 1pm, he called me and said, ""Where are you?"" Thankfully I happened to be free and rushed down, and I'm glad I did.
 
I am, together with each one of you, saddened by his passing,
but his legacy will live on, in his writings, in the legal textbooks containing accounts of his cases, newspapers, websites,
and most importantly, in our hearts.

Even though he has passed on, he will live forever as a loving father, loving husband, a gentleman at the Bar and a dear friend to all of us.

Now, after years of work and recovery from the conflict, once again Maluku is ready to be known as Maluku Manise (translated: Sweet Maluku). #BarondaMaluku is a project, an idea, a dream. A creative team of ten people which consist of photographers, videographers and bloggers will explore Maluku for 6 days (May 25-30) and produce videos, photos and articles/ writen guides. We do this to help people get to know Maluku better and what it offers. We want to bring back Maluku's old title as Maluku Manise. http://indonesia.travel/barondamaluku/",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The place is a sacred site of the first order, and its central temple, the UNESCO World Heritage listed Mahabodhi Temple, is an obligatory stop on the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit. 
Adjacent to the Mahabodhi Temple is the Bodhi tree itself under which Prince Siddhartha Gautama is said to have attained Enlightenment 2,500 years ago. As a result he became the Buddha - the Enlightened One. Bodh Gaya or Uruvela, as it was known during Buddha‚Äôs times, is also a major pilgrimage centre for Hindus as Buddha is considered to be the ninth incarnation of Vishnu.

Did Sukiyaki or Shabu-Shabu come up to your mind as nabe?
There are actually a whole bunch of different types of it in each area of Japan. New types of nabe keep coming up lately, such as Tonyu (Soymilk)-nabe, Tomato-nabe, Carbonara-nabe, and even Collagen-nabe (can you even imagine what it would taste like?)! You can put any food you want into the pot, so the sky is the limit!

What is it like? 
Baguio City is a city on the Cordillera Central mountain range, which is 1,600 meters above sea level. The place is lined with pine trees, and has a subtropical highland climate with temperatures going down as low as nine degrees Celcius during the cool months of December, January and February. ""The Summer Capital of the Philippines"" can get a little crowded during March, April and May, when people from other cities come for a visit to escape the urban heat. 

Fun Fact: 
Tam-Awan was built to showcase a model village of authentic Ifugao huts, which are expertly constructed without the use of nails. The compact huts are elevated to shoulder level by four sturdy wooden posts. Tam-Awan is a popular tourist site in Baguio City not only for its huts, but also for its art galleries, annual art exhibits, workshops and cultural performances.

The Archipelago contains 362 volcanic islands scattered in the Bay of Bengal, with only 37 of these being inhabited. These lush green islands have colourful historical past, with strings of invasions by the French, Dutch, Japanese and British and wars between settlers and the native tribes. The Cellular Jail, where hundreds of Indian revolutionaries were imprisoned during the Indian freedom struggle, still stands tall. 

Descendents of these political prisoners and the local tribes of the area are the inhabitants of modern day Andaman and Nicobar. The tropical rain forests that loom close to the seashore are home to unique species of birds, and to tribes that still haven't learned to use fire.
