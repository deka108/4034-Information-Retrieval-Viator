""When one mentions Indonesia as a travel destination, Bali is probably the first place that comes to mind. A few years ago, I had fallen hard for Bali but later discovered I wasn't the only woman in its life. I remember reading, with a sinking heart, that the global popularity of Eat, Pray, Love (no, I am not a fan) inspired hordes of tourists to Bali.

I was ready to move on. 

While Julia Roberts' character may have found love in Bali, I believe there is much more to do in this bustling country consisting of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups, than staring deeply into the eyes of your loved one. I was more than happy to visit the less popular locations in East Java. 

I hopped on a plane to Surabaya and was ready to spend the next four days exploring Surabaya, Malang and Mt. Bromo.""

The park has four main entrances, Panpatha in the north, Tala in the east (most of the hotels are located in Tala), Dhamokar in the south-west and Khitauli in the west. Two roads, Umaria-Rewa highway and Parasi-Katni road via Khitauli pass through the park. Tala is a small village on the Umaria-Rewa state highway. 

The Original home of all the white tigers alive, today, Bandhavgarh was the hunting ground of the Maharajas of Rewa; their old fort still dominates a hill in the forest. These white tigers were found in the old state of Rewa for many years. The last known tiger was captured by Maharaja Martand Singh in 1951. The White Tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharaja of Rewa.

_______

Three months after kicking off 2016 with a social media contest, the Department of Tourism (DOT) announced on Friday, 19 February 2016, the three winners of the photo-fail challenge, each bagging a trip for two back to the Philippines. The contest encouraged foreign visitors to post their best photo-fails taken in the islands, highlighting their fun and candid experiences in the country.

Bannered under the theme ""Visit the Philippines Again 2016,"" this year's tourism campaign aims to attract repeat visitors and new travelers alike to come visit the country and relive the fun experiences they had with their friends, loved ones, and even strangers-turned-friends.

Photo-fail images submitted by Jarne Uytersprot from Belgium, Chintai Kato from Japan, and Kaisa Kapanen from Finland were chosen among thousands who submitted their photos. These photo-fails highlighted off-guard moments of tourists while having fun in the Philippines.

Launched at the World Travel Mart in London, England last November, the social media contest invited foreign passport holders who have been to the Philippines to upload their own photo-fail versions on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook with the official hashtag #visitphilippinesagain2016. Winners of the contest will get a chance to re-do their photos taken in some of the top vacation destinations in the country.

""This social media campaign was our way to heighten up the excitement for big events lined up for the Philippines this year. 2016 is the year of 'again' and 'Visit the Philippines Again' will once more highlight the country as a multi-level experience destination filled with exciting activities and endless new discoveries, shared with their warm and fun-loving hosts, the Filipino people,"" says Tourism Secretary Ramon R. Jimenez, Jr.

Among the big events lined up this year are the Routes Asia 2016, Madrid Fusion Manila 2016, Flavors of the Philippines, Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2016, 2016 Ironman 70.3 Asia Pacific Championship, MTV Music Evolution 2016, the World Street Food Congress, and the Travel Blog Exchange (TBEX).

How to Get There:
Take a bus bound for Baguio from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
Horses were brought to the Philippines from the lands of Malaysia. And then more came with the Spanish from China and Japan. In Baguio City in the north, you can go horseback-riding in Wright Park. There's an inner circle for walking horses and outer circle for running horses. ""Pony Boys"" will help and watch over you and the horse 
the whole time, to keep you safe.

Fun Fact:
The Filipino word for horse is kabayo – derived rom the Spanish word, caballo.  Kabayo is also a Filipinos term for an ironing board, due to its horse-like shape.

Soft corals prefer nutrient-rich waters and less light. They may look like plants, but corals are marine animals that need food.

在拍攝後兩天 我見有空閒時間 看見這相片在硬碟內 再想想反正那麼辛苦登山才拍下 就整理一下這張相片吧 再在睡覺前分享到網絡 想不到一醒來時 看見有那麼多人在討論這張相片 也因這張相片令我其他的相片有更多人看到 我十分感欣 所以非常感謝分享及報導這相片的朋友 你們的支持是很重要呀 能給我更大的動力拍攝出不一樣的香港

The best way to describe the Beatiful Destinations team is they represent a sector of travel that is very adventurous. They like to go where people have never been before. They like to look at familiar places from a very unfamiliar attitude. So what they're saying is, this is what is the most incredible experiences that they've had. Now the advantage of this is, because of their unique perspective, they're sending out images of the Philippines that even we have never seen before, at least from the perspective that they have. And that's a tremendous boost for us.Are you following Beautiful Destinations on Instagram and Facebook? You should be. They just visited the Philippines!

And getting massages on it. You'll form quite an attachment to Boracay sand. Just please don't take any of it home! Leave the beach for others to enjoy.

Om Beach, one of Gokarna’s five famed beaches, takes the shape of an “Om”, a Hindu spiritual symbol.

The other beaches, wedged between gigantic cliffs that protrude like delicate fingers into the sea, are Gokarna, Kudle, Half Moon, and Paradise. The drive up the winding path that leads to Gokarna is a scenic delight with rocky mountains and the Western Ghats on one side, and the Arabian Sea on the other.

Among those who benefit from the earnings generated by Tourism are locals from touristic destinations who derive livelihood from it. Take the case of Kuya Eran Decena whose story is told by Cyrus John Malonzo (@the_boy_who_leaves on Instagram). 

""During my 2nd trip to #Coron, I met Kuya Eran Decena, who happens to be one of the well-known tour guides in town. He was famous that he was even featured on travel publication, Lonely Planet.

""My interaction with him indeed proved why he was well-known. First, he is very engaging and funny; there was no dull moment as we travelled from one island to the next. Second, he knows a lot about Coron, from affordable boat rides and accommodations to various detours for delicious local delicacies. And third, you can feel his love for his hometown, especially when he shared his efforts during the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda in Coron, as well as his concerns about commercial developments that pose threats on the island's pristine beauty.

""He said that when he started as a tour guide 15 years ago, there was only a handful of European foreigners visiting Coron. But with more flights and ferries leading to their town, the influx of local tourists has helped sustain their means of living. 

""He used to live in Manila and worked as a messenger for a multinational company before deciding to become a tour guide. I felt that he made the right decision because he is enjoying his job. He even promotes scenic photos of Coron on his own Facebook page. And I sincerely hope that when I get the chance to visit Coron again, he will still sport the same smile that we saw from him two years ago.""

Siargao, Surigao del Norte

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Surigao (one hour), then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a bus from Manila or Davao to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a boat from Manila to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Formerly known as well Hill Tippera, Tripura is located in the extreme south-west corner of the North-eastern region. The origin of the name of Tripura is still a matter of controversy among historians and researchers. According to the 'Rajmala"", Tripura’s celebrated court chronicle, an ancient king named 'tripur' ruled over the territorial domain known as 'Tripura' and the name of the kingdom was derived from his name. Many researchers explain the name 'Tripura' from its etymological origin and its geographic location: the word 'Tripura' means 'near water'.
 
The early history of the kingdom of Tripura is a complex blend of history and mythology, and has a history of over 2,500 years and 186 kings. It was formerly an independent Tripuri kingdom and was merged with independent India on October15, 1949 by the Tripura Merger Agreement.

The Khajuraho temples were built in the short span of a hundred years, from 950-1050 AD in truly inspired burst of creativity.

Bato Church, Catanduanes

What is it like? 
Upon entering Bato town, you’ll be greeted by the charming façade of a century-old church. The St. John the Baptist Church (commonly known as the Bato church) took 53 years to build.

The people whose lives and livelihood are now dependent on this growing industry in the Philippines called tourism.

Our first story is from @vin_aranas87 (on Instagram) who traveled in May 2015 to Itbayat, #Batanes, the northernmost inhabited island of the Philippines. There, he met their tour guide, Kuya Pepe.

""We met Kuya Pepe on our second day and discussed with him our plans of reaching the #RafangCliffs on the eastern side of #Itbayat. Getting to this place needs some great deal of advice from him as he was the only person allowed to pass through private properties leading to Rafang Cliffs.

""Although he was Marine Engineer by profession, Kuya Pepe chose to stay in the island to be with his family and make a living out of tour-guiding. He explained that being a tour guide has helped him with much of their expenses; he was able to send his kids to school until they finished their studies.

""But aside from the fulfillment he gives his family, he also finds personal joy whenever he sees people enjoying their visit to Itbayat.""

Anilao, Batangas

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Batangas from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
Funny how a dive site that has the Tagalog word of garbage for its name is one of the best dive spots in Anilao. A lot of interesting creatures can be spotted in Basura — octopuses, seahorses, tiny frogfishes, ghost pipefish, and tiny shrimps. This area is classified as a muck dive site, hiding all those species under a viscous sea of mud. Come to think of it, the name's making a little more sense now.

Fun Fact:
You can go for a diving expedition to a Spanish galleon which sank in 1620. Visibility is good, and the site is home to many beautiful fish and corals. Just ask your tour guides to show you the way.

How to Get There:
""Fly from Manila to Cagayan de Oro.

Or take a boat from Manila, Iloilo, or Cebu to Cagayan de Oro.""

What is it?
Whitewater rafting in the Philippines started in Cagayan de Oro City, the country's ""Adventure Capital,"" in 1995. It was just a hobby for Rupert Domingo and Julius Bioco, but it flourished into a thrilling endeavour – not just for themselves, but for other adventure-seekers as well. The two spent a decade surveying and crossing the river, painstakingly mastering its shape and channels. Now, tourists rely on their group's rafting expertise for an unforgettable adventure along the Cagayan River.

Fun Fact:
The 23 rapids of Cagayan River have names. Some are funny, and some are intimidating – Elephant, Letter L, Letter S, Cloud 10, I'm Busy, Twister, 360, Surprise, Kiss The Wall, Braves Way, Rodeo, etc.

This dance form originated as devotional Garba dance performed in honour of Goddess Durga.

Dandiya Raas involves men and women dancing in circular movements, with sticks in their hands. The sticks of the dance symbolize the sword of Goddess Durga. The men wear special turbans and kedias, while women wear colourful and vibrant traditional dresses such as ghagra, embroidered choli and bandhani dupattas sparkling with mirror work and heavy jewellery.

The festival is just one element of the WWF's marine conservation work. They're working with retailers, hotels, restaurants and traders to raise awareness of seafood from sustainable sources - that is, responsible fishing and farming.

Explorations in the area have revealed that the park has no less than 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 11 species of shark, 13 species of whale and dolphin and even 100 species of bird. It is also the nesting grounds of green sea turtles and critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles. CNN Travel named it as one of the best dive sites in the world.

Fun Fact: 
Tubbataha is isolated, and can only be visited on a liveboard boat. There are no settlements on the islets in the area. Divers who want to visit and have an unforgettable experience must book in advance.

There was a girl, Tatsuko, in the area of Lake Tazawa. Everybody knew she was beautiful and attractive. One day when she realized she truly owns beauty, she started clinging to it. She did not want to lose neither her beauty nor the youth. She wanted them forever that she went to shrine to ask for a help. “Guanyin”(enlightenment being in Buddhism) suggested her to drink water of the lake as much as possible. She kept drinking with suffer, gradually, she turned into “tatsu” (dragon). Since then, she started living in the Lake. Her husband experienced the same thing in the northern lake. He, also in a dragon shape, came to Lake Tazawa, and they have lived together. Having two owners, Lake Tazawa got deeper and deeper.

It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

Fun Fact:
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

Angono, Rizal

What is it like? 
Water is so central to Angono life that during the town's yearly festival, fishermen hang their catch near the image of the town's patron saint. Of course, St. Clement is also the patron saint of fishermen. Afterwards, the image, the fish and the fishermen get on a large boat and parade down the Angono River.

Fun Fact: 
Angono is also known for its higantes — colorful oversized paper-mache effigies.

What is it? 
A vinta's sail is made up of vertical stripes of assorted colors that represent the colorful history of the peninsula's Muslim community. About a third of its population is made up of ethnic communities that give the region its unique flavor. These include the Tausugs, Samals, Yakans, Badjaos, and Subanens. Wait until you start hearing the people speak Chabacano – arguably the suavest-sounding dialect because of its heavy Spanish influence.

How to get there: 
Fly into Zamboanga from Manila, Cebu or Davao.

Or take a boat to Zamboanga from Manila.

Fun Fact: 
Vinta is also the name of a Moro dance performed to commemorate the migration of the Filipinos. Dancers imitate the movement of the vintas by balancing on the tops of poles.

Mount Abu is situated at the southern tip of the Aravali range, the hill retreat owes its cool climate to its rich flora covering the entire hillside that includes coniferous trees and flowering shrubs. During the period of the Maharajas, it was used as a place of leisure by the royalties. The place presents an interesting contrast of British style bungalows and holiday lodges with various tribal communities residing amidst the thick lush forest on the hills surrounding the region.

Fly into Zamboanga from Manila, Cebu or Davao.

Or take a boat to Zamboanga from Manila.

What is it?
A vinta's sail is made up of vertical stripes of assorted colors that represent the colorful history of the peninsula's Muslim community. About a third of its population is made up of ethnic communities that give the region its unique flavor. These include the Tausugs, Samals, Yakans, Badjaos, and Subanens. Wait until you start hearing the people speak Chabacano – arguably the suavest-sounding dialect because of its heavy Spanish influence.

Fun Fact:
Vinta is also the name of a Moro dance performed to commemorate the migration of the Filipinos. Dancers imitate the movement of the vintas by balancing on the tops of poles.

Literally meaning ‘cow’s ear,’ the quant town of Gokarna in Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka is formed by the ear-shaped confluence of two rivers and the favourite haunt of Hindu pilgrims, Sanskrit scholars, and beach buffs. Om Beach, one of Gokarna’s five famed beaches, takes the shape of an “Om”, a Hindu spiritual symbol.

The other beaches, wedged between gigantic cliffs that protrude like delicate fingers into the sea, are Gokarna, Kudle, Half Moon, and Paradise. The drive up the winding path that leads to Gokarna is a scenic delight with rocky mountains and the Western Ghats on one side, and the Arabian Sea on the other. Adventurous tourists must be prepared for a bit of cliff-scrambling in this coastal town.

Banaue Rice Terraces, Ifugao

How to Get There:
Take a bus bound for Banaue from Sampaloc.

Or take a bus bound for Baguio from Cubao or Pasay, then transfer to a bus bound for Banaue.

Somnath temple is a highlight of any trip to Gujarat.

One of the oldest places of pilgrimage, the temple finds mention in ancient texts and scriptures.
 
Its glowing description by 11th century Arab traveler Al Biruni prompted an unwelcome visit by Mahmud of Ghazni who ransacked and destroyed the temple in 1025 AD. Razed and rebuilt at least six times since its foundation, the existing temple standing at the shore of the Arabian Sea came into being as a result of the efforts of Sardar Patel, the Iron man of India.
