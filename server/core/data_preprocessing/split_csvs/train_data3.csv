""When one mentions Indonesia as a travel destination, Bali is probably the first place that comes to mind. A few years ago, I had fallen hard for Bali but later discovered I wasn't the only woman in its life. I remember reading, with a sinking heart, that the global popularity of Eat, Pray, Love (no, I am not a fan) inspired hordes of tourists to Bali.

I was ready to move on. 

While Julia Roberts' character may have found love in Bali, I believe there is much more to do in this bustling country consisting of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups, than staring deeply into the eyes of your loved one. I was more than happy to visit the less popular locations in East Java. 

I hopped on a plane to Surabaya and was ready to spend the next four days exploring Surabaya, Malang and Mt. Bromo.""

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bandhavgarh National Park, lying in the heart of the Vindhya Mountain Range in Central India, is a small and compact National Park, yet full of game. The density of the tiger population at Bandhavgarh is the highest known in India. 
The centre of the park is dominated by the majestic Bandhavgarh Fort built in the 14th century, around which are numerous caves containing shrines and ancient Sanskrit inscriptions. The park has four main entrances, Panpatha in the north, Tala in the east (most of the hotels are located in Tala), Dhamokar in the south-west and Khitauli in the west. Two roads, Umaria-Rewa highway and Parasi-Katni road via Khitauli pass through the park. Tala is a small village on the Umaria-Rewa state highway. 

The Original home of all the white tigers alive, today, Bandhavgarh was the hunting ground of the Maharajas of Rewa; their old fort still dominates a hill in the forest. These white tigers were found in the old state of Rewa for many years. The last known tiger was captured by Maharaja Martand Singh in 1951. The White Tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharaja of Rewa.

The oldest existing city in the Indian peninsula and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Madurai is richly steeped in cultural heritage. The city, earlier known as Madhurapuri, grew around a huge temple built by Pandian King Kulasekhara 2,500 years ago. 

Madurai became famous during the Sangam period through the third and last conglomeration of Tamil scholars, which existed for more than 100 years. The city was the magnificent capital of Pandya kings and visited by travellers such as Megasthenes (302 BC), Pliny (77 AD), Ptolemy (140 AD), Marco Polo (1203 AD) and Ibu Batuta (1333 AD). Today, Madurai is synonymous with the awe-inspiring Meenakshi-Sundareswarar Temple

_______

Three months after kicking off 2016 with a social media contest, the Department of Tourism (DOT) announced on Friday, 19 February 2016, the three winners of the photo-fail challenge, each bagging a trip for two back to the Philippines. The contest encouraged foreign visitors to post their best photo-fails taken in the islands, highlighting their fun and candid experiences in the country.

Bannered under the theme ""Visit the Philippines Again 2016,"" this year's tourism campaign aims to attract repeat visitors and new travelers alike to come visit the country and relive the fun experiences they had with their friends, loved ones, and even strangers-turned-friends.

Photo-fail images submitted by Jarne Uytersprot from Belgium, Chintai Kato from Japan, and Kaisa Kapanen from Finland were chosen among thousands who submitted their photos. These photo-fails highlighted off-guard moments of tourists while having fun in the Philippines.

Launched at the World Travel Mart in London, England last November, the social media contest invited foreign passport holders who have been to the Philippines to upload their own photo-fail versions on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook with the official hashtag #visitphilippinesagain2016. Winners of the contest will get a chance to re-do their photos taken in some of the top vacation destinations in the country.

""This social media campaign was our way to heighten up the excitement for big events lined up for the Philippines this year. 2016 is the year of 'again' and 'Visit the Philippines Again' will once more highlight the country as a multi-level experience destination filled with exciting activities and endless new discoveries, shared with their warm and fun-loving hosts, the Filipino people,"" says Tourism Secretary Ramon R. Jimenez, Jr.

Among the big events lined up this year are the Routes Asia 2016, Madrid Fusion Manila 2016, Flavors of the Philippines, Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2016, 2016 Ironman 70.3 Asia Pacific Championship, MTV Music Evolution 2016, the World Street Food Congress, and the Travel Blog Exchange (TBEX).

Baguio City, Benguet

How to Get There:
Take a bus bound for Baguio from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
Horses were brought to the Philippines from the lands of Malaysia. And then more came with the Spanish from China and Japan. In Baguio City in the north, you can go horseback-riding in Wright Park. There's an inner circle for walking horses and outer circle for running horses. ""Pony Boys"" will help and watch over you and the horse 
the whole time, to keep you safe.

Fun Fact:
The Filipino word for horse is kabayo ‚Äì derived rom the Spanish word, caballo.  Kabayo is also a Filipinos term for an ironing board, due to its horse-like shape.

What is it like? 
Soft corals prefer nutrient-rich waters and less light. They may look like plants, but corals are marine animals that need food. And this type feeds on zooplankton, or organisms incapable of swimming against a current ‚Äì making it the ideal treat for hungry marine creatures. You can find soft corals in Anilao's colorful underwater gardens, which are home to all sorts of tropical fish.

Fun Fact: 
Some soft corals are not actually soft. They're more tree-like and flexible, and can dance gracefully in the waves.

And getting massages on it. You'll form quite an attachment to Boracay sand. Just please don't take any of it home! Leave the beach for others to enjoy.

Fun Fact:
Come dusk, young boys and girls take to the beach to begin sculpting impressive pieces of sand art. For a small fee, they can even personalize the sand art for you!

Om Beach, one of Gokarna‚Äôs five famed beaches, takes the shape of an ‚ÄúOm‚Äù, a Hindu spiritual symbol.

The other beaches, wedged between gigantic cliffs that protrude like delicate fingers into the sea, are Gokarna, Kudle, Half Moon, and Paradise. The drive up the winding path that leads to Gokarna is a scenic delight with rocky mountains and the Western Ghats on one side, and the Arabian Sea on the other.

Among those who benefit from the earnings generated by Tourism are locals from touristic destinations who derive livelihood from it. Take the case of Kuya Eran Decena whose story is told by Cyrus John Malonzo (@the_boy_who_leaves on Instagram). 

""During my 2nd trip to #Coron, I met Kuya Eran Decena, who happens to be one of the well-known tour guides in town. He was famous that he was even featured on travel publication, Lonely Planet.

""My interaction with him indeed proved why he was well-known. First, he is very engaging and funny; there was no dull moment as we travelled from one island to the next. Second, he knows a lot about Coron, from affordable boat rides and accommodations to various detours for delicious local delicacies. And third, you can feel his love for his hometown, especially when he shared his efforts during the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda in Coron, as well as his concerns about commercial developments that pose threats on the island's pristine beauty.

""He said that when he started as a tour guide 15 years ago, there was only a handful of European foreigners visiting Coron. But with more flights and ferries leading to their town, the influx of local tourists has helped sustain their means of living. 

""He used to live in Manila and worked as a messenger for a multinational company before deciding to become a tour guide. I felt that he made the right decision because he is enjoying his job. He even promotes scenic photos of Coron on his own Facebook page. And I sincerely hope that when I get the chance to visit Coron again, he will still sport the same smile that we saw from him two years ago.""

Siargao, Surigao del Norte

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn‚Äôt a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 ‚Äî known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It‚Äôs only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They‚Äôve got water and waves to spare.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Surigao (one hour), then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a bus from Manila or Davao to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a boat from Manila to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Formerly known as well Hill Tippera, Tripura is located in the extreme south-west corner of the North-eastern region. The origin of the name of Tripura is still a matter of controversy among historians and researchers. According to the 'Rajmala"", Tripura‚Äôs celebrated court chronicle, an ancient king named 'tripur' ruled over the territorial domain known as 'Tripura' and the name of the kingdom was derived from his name. Many researchers explain the name 'Tripura' from its etymological origin and its geographic location: the word 'Tripura' means 'near water'.
 
The early history of the kingdom of Tripura is a complex blend of history and mythology, and has a history of over 2,500 years and 186 kings. It was formerly an independent Tripuri kingdom and was merged with independent India on October15, 1949 by the Tripura Merger Agreement.

The people whose lives and livelihood are now dependent on this growing industry in the Philippines called tourism.

Our first story is from @vin_aranas87 (on Instagram) who traveled in May 2015 to Itbayat, #Batanes, the northernmost inhabited island of the Philippines. There, he met their tour guide, Kuya Pepe.

""We met Kuya Pepe on our second day and discussed with him our plans of reaching the #RafangCliffs on the eastern side of #Itbayat. Getting to this place needs some great deal of advice from him as he was the only person allowed to pass through private properties leading to Rafang Cliffs.

""Although he was Marine Engineer by profession, Kuya Pepe chose to stay in the island to be with his family and make a living out of tour-guiding. He explained that being a tour guide has helped him with much of their expenses; he was able to send his kids to school until they finished their studies.

""But aside from the fulfillment he gives his family, he also finds personal joy whenever he sees people enjoying their visit to Itbayat.""

Anilao, Batangas

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Batangas from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
Funny how a dive site that has the Tagalog word of garbage for its name is one of the best dive spots in Anilao. A lot of interesting creatures can be spotted in Basura ‚Äî octopuses, seahorses, tiny frogfishes, ghost pipefish, and tiny shrimps. This area is classified as a muck dive site, hiding all those species under a viscous sea of mud. Come to think of it, the name's making a little more sense now.

Fun Fact:
You can go for a diving expedition to a Spanish galleon which sank in 1620. Visibility is good, and the site is home to many beautiful fish and corals. Just ask your tour guides to show you the way.

More than 87% of the world's oceans are overfished, and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) believes we'll run out of fish by 2048 if we keep this up. To raise awareness of this distressing scenario, the WWF has launched Singapore's inaugural Sustainable Seafood Festival, which runs until 15 June 2014. 

The festival is just one element of the WWF's marine conservation work. They're working with retailers, hotels, restaurants and traders to raise awareness of seafood from sustainable sources - that is, responsible fishing and farming.

Tubbataha Reef, Sulu Sea

What is it like? 
Tubbataha Reef is a natural marine park that's considered as the global center of marine biodiversity. UNESCO has declared it a World Heritage Site, and in 1999 the Ramsar Convention in Iran listed it as one of the ""wetlands of international importance."" Explorations in the area have revealed that the park has no less than 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 11 species of shark, 13 species of whale and dolphin and even 100 species of bird. It is also the nesting grounds of green sea turtles and critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles. CNN Travel named it as one of the best dive sites in the world.

Fun Fact: 
Tubbataha is isolated, and can only be visited on a liveboard boat. There are no settlements on the islets in the area. Divers who want to visit and have an unforgettable experience must book in advance.

It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

Fun Fact:
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

Mount Abu is situated at the southern tip of the Aravali range, the hill retreat owes its cool climate to its rich flora covering the entire hillside that includes coniferous trees and flowering shrubs. During the period of the Maharajas, it was used as a place of leisure by the royalties. The place presents an interesting contrast of British style bungalows and holiday lodges with various tribal communities residing amidst the thick lush forest on the hills surrounding the region.

Calle (road) Crisologo is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is one of the few Hispanic towns saved from destruction during World War II.

Our objective was to trade several kilos of pork which we had previously butchered in exchange for a supply of fresh water. By then we were still a few hundred Kilometers from Culion Island. 

The community of 5 families we stopped at had access to a fresh water spring but would not take any form of currency. 

Looking back now as I write this, that was probably the most raw human experience I ever had having to trade and barter goods at a place where money had no value. 

I can vividly remember the proud look on my girlfriend Hayley‚Äôs face as we were sailing away, after she walked away with 5 fresh coconuts in exchange for a bottle of rum. I told her she lost that trade big time.

One of the oldest places of pilgrimage, the temple finds mention in ancient texts and scriptures.
 
Its glowing description by 11th century Arab traveler Al Biruni prompted an unwelcome visit by Mahmud of Ghazni who ransacked and destroyed the temple in 1025 AD. Razed and rebuilt at least six times since its foundation, the existing temple standing at the shore of the Arabian Sea came into being as a result of the efforts of Sardar Patel, the Iron man of India.

Apart from TajMahal, if there is another monument that symbolises Indiait is the majestic Sun Temple at Konark, a UNESCO World Heritage.

It represents the very pinnacle of the Kalinga School of Temple Architecture.
