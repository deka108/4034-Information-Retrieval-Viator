Kanchipuram, the golden city of a thousand temples, was once the capital of the Pallava dynasty. It is considered one of the seven sacred cities of India; some of the best temples were built here during the reign of the Pallavas between the 6th and 7th centuries. Subsequently, Kanchipuram also served as an important city of the far-flung empires of the Chola and the Vijayanagara dynasties.

Later, these dynasties too contributed greatly in the temple building activity of this town. 
The city has also been, through the years, a great seat of learning and culture. Adi Sankaracharya established his episcopal seat (Kamakodipeedam) here. Sri Sankaracharya, Appar, Siruthonder and the great Buddhist Bikshu, Bodhidharma, once lived and worked here. Today, it is known not only for temples but also for its hand-woven, silk fabrics.

Manila Bay

What is it? 
Apart from the spellbinding sunset that prompts romantic trysts along the boardwalk, Manila Bay is also one of the best natural harbors in the world. The large port has always facilitated trade between the Philippines and its neighbors, boosting the economic development even before the Spanish era. Today there is still activity in the area, as it is near one of the largest malls in the world — the SM Mall of Asia.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
For 550 pesos, you can go on an hour-long cruise that comes complete with a set dinner and a live acoustic band. Trips happen daily, but are only scheduled from 4:30pm to 9pm.

Anilao, Batangas

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Batangas from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
Funny how a dive site that has the Tagalog word of garbage for its name is one of the best dive spots in Anilao. A lot of interesting creatures can be spotted in Basura — octopuses, seahorses, tiny frogfishes, ghost pipefish, and tiny shrimps. This area is classified as a muck dive site, hiding all those species under a viscous sea of mud. Come to think of it, the name's making a little more sense now.

Fun Fact:
You can go for a diving expedition to a Spanish galleon which sank in 1620. Visibility is good, and the site is home to many beautiful fish and corals. Just ask your tour guides to show you the way.

477,225524117535380_991125854308532,"This is the true spirit of CNY. 

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

#bestyeyeintheworldI am still recovering from a massive sobbing fit as I type this, so do pardon me if there are any typos or grammatical errors. This year, my family's CNY reunion dinner went completely beyond my expectaitions.

Last August I came out to Mum and Dad, and was promptly kicked out. I had prepared for the worst, though, and moved in with a friend. So all went well, more or less, except for me being somewhat depressed and withdrawn. I was not expecting to be called back for the reunion this year.

Enter my maternal grandfather, Ye Ye, a.k.a. The Colonel. He retired from the Malaysian army as a colonel, and is still much respected in the family. The fact that he takes no crap from anyone probably helped that. I was about to go for a drink (alone) for my CNY eve, when he called me. What follows is a rough outline of what he said:

Ye Ye: What is this about my only grandson not attending the reunion tonight?
Me: I no longer live with Mum and Dad.
Ye Ye: So?
Me: Well... (don't recall exactly how it went, but I told him the truth, and about how I got kicked out).

He just said, ""Very well."" and told me that he expected to see me at the reunion ASAP and if I knew what was good for me I would be there. No idea why I went back, but I did.

At the reunion, the whole house went silent when I walked in. Some of my relatives started whisrpering among themselves, and some gave me looks of barely concealed disgust.

Ye Ye himself was at the dinner table, and stood up when he saw me. What he said right then still rings in my ears.

""This is XXXX. My grandson. Some of you think he is not fit to be part of this family home simply because he is attracted to men instead of women. Shame on you! If he leaves, I will too, and FUCK anyone who dares to tell me otherwise!""

The whole house went quiet, and Ye Ye told me to come over and have some food. I was in tears by then, and he told me not to cry, and that he was sorry for not doing anything earlier (according to him no one told him anything until the afternoon, whe=n he noticed me missing from my usual spot chopping vegetables). Dinner was a silent affair, but he did ask me a lot of questions about how I'd been, whether I was happy, so on.

After dinner, I went to see him in his room, and cried. I knelt down and asked for forgiveness for not continuing his family line and for having brought any shame to him. But this man, my grandfather, a military veteran, just told me that it was fine, and that I had done no wrong. That I had been enough of a man to speak the truth, and that by doing so, he was more proud of me than if I had chosen to live a double life. He did admit to some disappointment that he wouldn't get any great grandchildren from me, but in his words, 'some things in life are not meant to be'.

God bless you Ye Ye.

520,67558139928_10153554682914929,"Batik is a technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to whole cloth, or cloth made using this technique. The word of batik is derived from the word “ambatik” which means “a cloth with little dots”. The suffix “tik” means “little dot, drop, point or to make dots”. Batik may also originate from the Javanese word “tritik” which describes a resist process for dying where the patterns are reserved on the textiles by tying and sewing areas prior to dying, similar to tie dye techniques. Another Javanese phase for the mystical experience of making batik is “mbatik manah” which means ”drawing a batik design on the earth”.

Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting or by printing resist with a copper stamp called a cap. The applied wax itself resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to color selectively by soaking the cloth in the one color, removing the wax with boiling water and repeating the process if multiple colors are desired.

Batik which made in the island of Java has a long history of acculturation, with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures, and is the most developed in terms of pattern, technique and the quality of workmanship. On October 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian Batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. http://ow.ly/RydRE

This time of the month, Filipino Catholics practice the Simbang Gabi (night mass) tradition. For nine straight days, starting on December 16, they wake up as early as 3AM to hear mass. This leads up to Christmas eve, the last day of Simbang Gabi, where the final mass is held. This is known as the Misa de Gallo (rooster's mass).

A traditional way of preserving them is letting them dry out under the sun. This can give them a shelf life of at least one year.

Fun Fact:

Greenhills, Metro Manila

What is it? 
Greenhills Shopping Centre is known for its ""flea market"" appeal, where you can haggle for anything — from DVD box sets to antique art pieces. It has over 2,000 stores, both indoor and outdoor. While most ""branded"" items sold here are of questionable legitimacy, you can find the country's best selection of genuine pearls in this bargain hunter's haven.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Then take a taxi, jeepney or bus to San Juan City.

Fun Fact: 
The majority of vendors and storekeepers in Greenhills are Muslim. Learn a few phrases of the Maranao dialect, and it is likely that you'll get an even bigger discount on their goods.

How to Get There:
Take a boat from Cebu to Siquijor.

What is it?
The island is famous for its virgin beaches and secret swimming spots. But the thing about Siquijor that probably resonates the most is its reputation for magic and sorcery.

Rameswaram, the holy island in the Gulf of Mannar, is a major pilgrim centre of the country. 
Rameswaram is hallowed by the epic Ramayana. It is believed that Lord Rama sanctified this place by worshipping Lord Shiva here after the war against Ravana of Sri Lanka. 

Therefore, it is held sacred by both Vishnu and Shiva devotees. It is one of the 12 Jyothirlinga shrines (where Lord Shiva is worshipped as a ‘Lingam (pillar) of light’) of India. A devout Hindu who visits Varanasi in the North must also visit Rameswaram for the culmination of his quest for salvation.

Located 90km south of Johor Bahru's city centre, Tanjung Piai's natural wonders have been gazetted into a National Park.

What is it?
It only takes a day to hike Mt. Pico de Loro. Though it's only 664 meters above sea level, the trail to the summit is difficult, but rewarding. Nestled in Ternate, it offers a view of mountainous landscapes and nearby islands. The best part is it’s only three hours away from Manila.

During the Spanish era, Mount Pico de Loro was a Filipino rebel’s camp and watch tower.

What is it like? 
Baguio City is a city on the Cordillera Central mountain range, which is 1,600 meters above sea level. The place is lined with pine trees, and has a subtropical highland climate with temperatures going down as low as nine degrees Celcius during the cool months of December, January and February. ""The Summer Capital of the Philippines"" can get a little crowded during March, April and May, when people from other cities come for a visit to escape the urban heat. 

Fun Fact: 
Tam-Awan was built to showcase a model village of authentic Ifugao huts, which are expertly constructed without the use of nails. The compact huts are elevated to shoulder level by four sturdy wooden posts. Tam-Awan is a popular tourist site in Baguio City not only for its huts, but also for its art galleries, annual art exhibits, workshops and cultural performances.

Inextricably linked with the history of Sikhism, Amritsar is amongst the most revered sites of the world. It was founded as recently as the 16th century. Its name is a derivative of the Amrit Sarovar (pool of nectar) amidst which stands the Golden Temple, the most sacred of Sikh shrines. Accounts suggest that Guru Amardas purchased the land from Emperor Akbar and decided to build a tank at the site. Following his death, it was completed by Guru Ramdas and also came to be known as Chak Ramdas or Guru ka Chak. Some of the oldest markets in Amritsar, notably Guru ka Bazaar, date back to his time. The construction of the Golden Temple was initiated by Guru Arjan Dev while Guru Hargobind, who accorded the religion a martial temper, built the Akal Takht in 1606. Amritsar has a rich history encompassing various mythical and historical narratives including the epic Ramayana. It is believed that the site called Ram Tirath was Maharish Valmiki’s ashram, where Sita reportedly gave birth to her twin sons, Luv and Kush. The Gobindgarh Fort and Ram Bagh were built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire. While the Jallianwala Bagh continues to be the most evocative monument to India’s freedom struggle. The Khalsa College, established by visionary leaders at the beginning of the 20th century turned Amritsar into a hub of education. Also a centre of thriving industry since its inception, Amritsar is famed for its textiles, particularly shawls, and for its carpets. Amritsar has gained tremendous popularity for its gourmet traditions; especially the dhabas (roadside eatery) that churn out, amongst an inexhaustible list of delicacies, irresistible kulchas, chola-bhaturas, tandoori chicken and fried fish. Amritsar has all the makings of a well-rounded tourist destination; its ancient legends, historical monuments, places of worship, old bazaars, theatre traditions and colourful festivals all serve as a window to its robust past. Excursions to the Harike Bird Sanctuary and visits to the India-Pakistan border at Wagah are an absolute delight, while breaking bread or celebrating Diwali with the denizens of this hospitable city is without parallel.(Courtesy Punjab Tourism)",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Boracay, Aklan

What is it like? 
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact: 
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

It is an ancient place that traces its roots to over three millennia. And in each chapter of its history, it has been crowned by a new name -- Kusumpur, Pushpapur, Pataliputra and Azeemabad. Patna is an excellent starting point for visiting the Buddhist and Jain pilgrim centres of Vaishali, Rajgir, Nalanda, Bodhgaya and Pawapuri, not only because of its ample transport connections, but because the history of Patna, evidently one of the oldest cities in the world, is essentially the history of ancient India.

Puerto Princesa, Palawan

What is it like? 
When fish swim in the same direction and in a coordinated manner, the behavior is called ""schooling."" But when they're together, interacting, it's called ""shoaling"". Fish shoal for protection against predators, better chances of finding food, and better chances of finding a mate – a shoalmate! You can watch schools or shoals of fish when you go snorkeling in Puerto Princesa's marine attractions, such as Honda Bay.

Fun Fact: 
Fish don't just randomly join a group. Like people, they pick who to hang out with – who their mates will be. And generally, they like large shoals with fish who are healthy and resemble their appearance. This is because a fish that stands out will be easy prey.

The earliest verifiable history of Kochi kingdom is traced to the last Perumal of the second Chera Dynasty, Rama Varma Kulashekara Perumal in the 12th century. 

Chinese and Arab traders are believed to have been the first traders to this port, heralding a wave of subsequent visitors, the Portuguese, Dutch and British, who brought in the era of colonial power to the region. Kochi was able to offer in abundance the best of spices to the world, a reputation that continues to this day.

In addition to spices, the voyagers also coveted the fine ivory, sandalwood, perfumes and gold that came to this market town. At one point nothing but a small fishing village, the destiny of Kochi changed in 1341, with the flooding of the Periyar River, which rendered the then popular Kodungallur ineffective. 

Among many repercussions of this event was the creation of a natural harbour at Kochi. It was Sir Robert Bristow, an experienced harbour engineer who came to Kochi in 1920 who was responsible for the modernization of Kochi harbour. The city is now the proud owner of one of the most beautiful ports of the country that is the biggest in Kerala and is also one of the premier industrial trading and commercial centres of southern India. Kochi expanded to include many towns and villages surrounding it and the corporation of Kochi was formed in 1967.

Want to know what it's like to swim inside a volcano? You can in Crater Lake. It's said that the high sulfuric content has medicinal properties. Some people have even scuba dived here.

Miri is a popular dive destination due to an abundance of pristine patch reefs. The Miri-Sibuti Coral Reefs National Park, lying at depths ranging from 7 to 30 metres has an average visibility of 10 to 30 metres. There are also some interesting wreck dives. The nearest dive site is a mere ten minutes from the marina bay jetty. One can land in Miri and be in water two hours later. Local dive operators offer certification programme as well.  Water temperature at the start of the season is normally 26 to 27ºC but can be as low as 23ºC at depth, as the NE monsoon still brings in cold water from the northern Pacific. By May the water temperature reaches the more normal 29 to 30ºC.  The best time to dive is from late March through November each year.  The diversity and accessibility of corals and other marine life on the reefs is amongst the best in the region.

Let’s find out why they are said like this.
Maybe one of reasons is using natural material cosmetics in a daily life.

Tsubaki oil (camellia-seed oil) used since 7th century, is effective in moisturizing and cutting off ultraviolet rays. Not only women use, sumo wrestlers use it to tie up their hair, and kabuki actors use it as their make-up base. 
Azuki bean has been used as skincare among upper class ladies from the ancient time. It accelerates blood flow, therefore it is good for getting rid of pimples and smoothing your skin. 
Komenuka (rice bran) is highly praised for its effect on beautifying skin. Its vitamins remove spots and works for anti-aging. 

For your information, cosmetics will be one of the tax-free products since this October.
It would be wonderful to buy Japanese cosmetics that suit your skin condition.

The common trait binding all three communities is its matrilineal system in which the family linage is taken from the mother's side. The people of Meghalaya are known to be hospitable, cheerful and friendly. The state’s area is divided in Khasi hills, Jaintia hills and Garo hills.

Siargao, Surigao del Norte

What is it like? 
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Surigao (one hour), then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a bus from Manila or Davao to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Or take a boat from Manila to Surigao, then take a boat to Siargao.

Fun Fact: 
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

What is it like? 
The T'boli Tribal Festival is an annual thanksgiving that's held every September in South Cotabato's Lake Sebu. Cultural dances, gong-playing, and ethnic sports like horsefighting are all part of this festival's program. This is a chance for the different tribes of the province to gather together with ethnic groups from Davao.

Fun Fact: 
The festival is held to honor the natives' belief in Lem-lunay – a Camelot or paradise that they would like to make of their tribe.

Do you like rice, but don’t own a rice cooker? No need to worry, you can cook rice in a pot!
First, wash the rice and place in a pot. Add water (rice to water ratio is 1: 1.2) and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it is boiling, cover with lid and let simmer for 12-15 minutes over low heat. Remove the pot from heat (with the lid still on) and let steam for another 10 minutes.
With these simple steps, you can taste soft, fluffy rice whenever you want!

The presence of 14 Rock Edicts of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka cut into a big rock outside the city bears testimony to its antiquity and attracts the historically minded. One of the reasons for visiting Junagadh is to transit to Sasangir, the entrancing preserve of Asiatic lion or to tour the beautiful shrine of Somnath.

Bantayan Beach, Cebu

What is it? 
Bantayan once served as a Spanish base against Moro invasions. That's why a walk around can transport you centuries back. You can see traces of its heritage in the old Spanish-era houses and dilapidated fort ruins. Mangroves and palm trees line the shores of Sugar Beach, Paradise Beach and Virgin Island.

How to get there: 
Fly into Cebu from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita, Incheon, or any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus to Cebu from either Dumaguete or Bacolod. Or take your car via a Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry.

Or take a boat to Cebu from Manila or any major city in Visayas and Mindanao.

Then take a bus or shuttle from Cebu City to Hagnaya, then a ferry to the port of Sta. Fe.

Fun Fact: 
This island's watchtowers gave it the name “Bantayan sa Hari” (Watchtower of the King). This was later shortened to “Bantayan,” the name it's known as today.

The event is starting from 1:00p.m., but here is a secret tip that you can enjoy Yabusame!
Try getting up early to visit morning practice in the shrine. You can take your time among so few spectators and closely watch archers harmonizing themselves with horses, their skill with their spirit in the crisp morning air. They will take you back a millennium to the age of the Samurai.

A picturesque little seaside resort on the west coast of Gujarat, Porbandar is dominated by the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, who was born here in 1869.

Also known as Sudamapuri in ancient times, after Sudama, the devoted friend of Lord Krishna, the place is dotted with several religious shrines. The picturesque coastal setting, lovely mangroves abounding in avian population and carefree days go a long way in making Porbandar an enticing destination.

Check out what we had to say about it!Are you a fan of TheSmartLocal.com? Here is what their editor-in-chief, Bryan Choo has to say about cyber-aggression in Singapore! 

""Cyber bullying could have grave consequences. In South Korea, even celebrities have committed suicide because of attacks from netizens.
 
In cyber bullying, we sometimes see very vocal minorities that end up drowning the sensible majority because people who are content simply don't speak up.

While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact:
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

Clients adore it. The first thing they say when they arrive is not hello. But ""WOW YOU GOT A GORGEOUS OFFICE""... which starts meetings of well! And now, this office could be yours! 

We love our 1,400 SQFT office to bits. Every inch of it is photogenic and it came to us tastefully decorated by the landlord. We also filmed many iconic episodes for TSLTV here, including this office tour video! 

Unfortunately, the TSL team has doubled in size over the last 1 and a half years and our office can no longer accommodate us. We have to bid a tearful farewell as we move to our new office, which is twice the size. 

Some office facts:

- The office can comfortably fit 20+ people.
- It is located at the tail end of Balestier Road, just a 10 min walk away from Novena MRT.
- It has a decent sized pantry/kitchen area and good amount of room for storage.
- Lots of food and facilities nearby including gyms, foodcourts, cinema, shopping malls, ntuc, etc
- It has 2 Levels. A mezzanine level makes it convenient to hold meetings or have a second department.
- Renovation was done just 1.5 years ago. The place is very well taken care of and the zen-like décor is gorgeous.
- Landlord is super nice and friendly and a familiar face in the media industry.
- Asking price is a low $4,XXX or nearest offer, with 5 months left in our contract. You have to take over our contract. But before agreeing, you can talk to our landlord to agree on an extension. So just think of this as taking on a brand new contract. 1 year or 1+1 or more.

One of these young Singaporeans voting for the very first time was our photojournalist, Nevin Lim. He read up on politics for the first time, attended his first of many rallies and he captured many poignant moments over GE2015. In this post, we share with you the GE15 election, through the eyes of a young Singaporean, voting for the very first time.

--------

""Politics didn’t bother me as I was growing up in Singapore. I learned about affairs of the state through my years of education and that was it. I was apolitical. I simply could not see the impact that politics would have on my life at a young age.

However, finally being of age to cast my vote in the General Elections (GE) 2015 heightened my interested about the political realm and how political leaders directly affect our lives as Singaporeans. It also made me realise that every single vote is crucial in deciding the fate of our small yet feisty nation. 

Our future depends on a capable and effective government.  

It was nerve wrecking to document the rallies as I didn’t know what to expect. I'm not proud to admit this, but before the elections started, I knew next to nothing about politics - and definitely nothing about all the loud and expressive politicians I eventually came to familiarise myself with. 

As I attempted to capture the emotions of the politicians and their supporters, I had the opportunity to cross paths with many interesting characters. I watched as a guy with a fractured arm weave through the crowd, hoping to render some support for his party. Other supporters arrived in wheelchairs, determined to let their voices be heard. These are our friends and neighbours, Singaporeans who could have watched television broadcasts and Youtube videos in the comfort of their homes but who chose to be part of this national event. It was heartwarming. 

Many who attended the GE2015 rallies would agree that some of the rallies felt like rock concerts. People cheered and jeered in equal measure as politicians made their speeches. I saw an old man shouting passionately about his problems. I love the shot of the guy who wore a viking helmet holding a large, flashy LED hammer saying “ I <3 SG”. Despite our political beliefs, we are united as a nation, fighting for the same goal - to better the lives of our loved ones.

But what surprised me was the number of young adults like me at the rallies. I never thought that we would care so much about politics. As a young Singaporean, I recognise my generation's tendency to favour bite sized information over the mainstream media, often turning to social media to keep ourselves updated about the news. 

But at the rallies, young Singaporeans showed that they care about the affairs of state. Their emotions were riled up, their energies amplified by that of their rambunctious elders yelling slogans. Standing in the crowd, even my apolitical self was caught up in the fervour.

Despite our opinions about the local political scene, let us not neglect the efforts of those who has built this nation to what it is today. No matter which political party we were yelling our lungs out for or silently supporting in the comfort of our homes, this is home that we care about. Our home.""",0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

And getting massages on it. You'll form quite an attachment to Boracay sand. Just please don't take any of it home! Leave the beach for others to enjoy.

Here's another shot of Sevilla's bamboo hanging bridge, serene in the morning hours as a local paddles onward. When traveling, I often get asked why I wake up before the sun, even as someone who isn't exactly a morning person. In addition to the common reason being staggering, natural light for film and photography, it's the rare window to behold a place's true character. This dawn was no exception, as I observed residents go about the beginning of their day undisturbed. Absorbing the culture in this way is what makes it all the more meaningful.

The Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary & National Park is situated at the tri-junction of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka on the North Eastern Slopes of the Nilgiris. An erstwhile game reserve, Mudumalai was declared a wildlife sanctuary in the early 1940 by the then Madras Presidency.

With Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Karnataka) in the north, and Wynad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala) in the west the region forms a single, continuous viable habitat for a varied range of wildlife and is a part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. While Mudumalai’s western half receives the southwest monsoon, the eastern tracts receive the relatively gentler north-east monsoon which results in a diversity of vegetation and typical migration of herbivores.

It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact:
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Orchha’s grandeur has been captured in stone, frozen in time; a rich legacy to the ages. For, on the medieval city, the hand of time has rested lightly and the p alaces and temples built by its Bundela rulers in the 16th and 17th centuries retain much of their pristine perfection.

Orchha was founded in the 16th century by the Bundela Rajput chieftain, Rudra Pratap, who chose this stretch of land along the Betwa river as an ideal site for his capital. Of the succeeding rulers, the most notable was Raja Bir Singh Ju Deo who built the exquisite Jehangir Mahal, a tiered palace crowned by graceful chhatris. From here the view of soaring temple spires and cenotaphs is spectacular.

Complementing the noble proportions of their exteriors are interiors which represent the finest flowering of the Bundela school of painting. In the Laxminarayan Temple and Raj Mahal, vibrant murals encompassing a variety of religious and secular themes, bring the walls and ceilings to rich life. Strewn around the area are the little shrines and memorials, each with its own poignant history, each contributing to the nostalgic beauty that is Orchha.

If Jaipur leaves you awestruck with its fairy tale charm, Jodhpur enthralls you with its pretty blue visage. Jodhpur, the ‘Blue City’, is a true architectural marvel.
