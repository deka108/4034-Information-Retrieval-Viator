Bundi and Kota once belonged to a single principality ruled by the Hada Chauhans. Later, two branches of the Hadas formed two separate states on either side of the Chambal-Kota and Bundi. 
Bundi is classic example of a fortress town bounded on all sides by hills.

The Princely State of Jhalawar was created in 1838 AD after being separated from Kota by the British. It got its name derived from Jhalas, the Jhala clan of Rajputs, also the rulers of Jhalawar

Carrying one's heavy pack along with the items of the rest of the group throughout the duration of the trek, which could last up to 10 or more hours per day depending on the trail, is something mountain guides and porters are willing to sacrifice for in exchange for a better source of income.

Where majority of our provincial lands' main source of livelihood rest in farming or fishing, most of these guides go back to such labor when they have no group to guide in the mountains.

But being a guide can earn four to five times more than what one can earn from fishing or farming in a day, and that is why they are willing to make the sacrifice and even eager to do so. At night in the campsite, they take shots of local rum, not to get drunk, but to ease their bodies from the pain and protect themselves from the cold. 

With better accessibility to the mountains, locals who lead groups visiting as guides or as porters, certainly have a better chance of living, and more money to feed their families.

We shouldn't take it against them for making a decent living out of being a guide or a porter. While there are those local communities who sadly and unfortunately abuse this opportunity, there are still those who do not and are very adamant about providing job opportunities for the locals while at the same time preserving the natural habitat of the mountains in their community.

From among these are the guides I met in Kanlaon Volcano in Negros. They limit climbers to 10 per day and require permits for any mountaineer visiting. They uphold the model for responsible mountaineering.

Lonely Planet’s commissioning editor, Robin Barton wrote of Penang: “Malaysian hawker food has spread worldwide through food trucks and pop-ups but nothing compares to Penang. Its food reflects the intermingling of the many cultures that arrived after Penang was set up as a trading port in 1786, from Malays to Indians, Achenese to Chinese, Burmese to Thais. The state capital, George Town is its culinary epicenter.”

Boracay, Aklan

How to Get There:
Fly from Manila to Caticlan.

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.

What is it?
Boracay kids have perfected the art of running, dropping a rounded plywood board into shallow surf, and skimming across the shore. The whole island is their playground. You shouldn't have any problems renting a board from them. But if you're a serious skimboarder, you'll want to head straight to Bulabog Beach.

Fun Fact:
Boracay Island is less than a kilometer wide.

The ruins of Nalanda stand testimony to one of the greatest centres of learning in recorded history.
This once world famous university attracted students from other parts of the world during the 5th-12th centuries AD.

Nalanda is also the birthplace of Sariputra, one of the chief disciples of the Lord Buddha. The antiquity of the place can be gauged from the fact that the Buddha used to make frequent visits to this place.

7 Letters is a collection of short-films by the best directors in Singapore. It was originally screened for just 3 nights at Capitol Theatre but because of the rave reviews, it was given an extended run at Golden Village cinemas. This run is ending very very soon. Book your tickets before it's too late!

Could not agree more with this review by The Straits Times.

""Give a bunch of artists some money, leave them alone and quite often, they will deliver something good. But once in a while, as in the case of shorts anthology 7 Letters, they will knock your socks off.

Perhaps it was the spirit of competition or maybe it was down to the desire of the film-makers trying to impress their peers. But whatever the motivation, the final product is top class.

7 Letters (PG, 116 minutes, 4.5/5 stars) started as a passion project by Royston Tan who, with the six other writer-directors, received government funds to make seven short films marking Singapore's 50th birthday, with each artist given free rein over his concept.

""Funded by government"" and ""commemorating a national event"" are not phrases usually associated with good art. Perhaps it is time to revise that opinion.""

Literally meaning ‘cow’s ear,’ the quant town of Gokarna in Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka is formed by the ear-shaped confluence of two rivers and the favourite haunt of Hindu pilgrims, Sanskrit scholars, and beach buffs. Om Beach, one of Gokarna’s five famed beaches, takes the shape of an “Om”, a Hindu spiritual symbol.

The other beaches, wedged between gigantic cliffs that protrude like delicate fingers into the sea, are Gokarna, Kudle, Half Moon, and Paradise. The drive up the winding path that leads to Gokarna is a scenic delight with rocky mountains and the Western Ghats on one side, and the Arabian Sea on the other.

Horses were brought to the Philippines from islands of Malaysia. And then more came with the Spanish from China and Japan. In Baguio City in the north, you can go horseback-riding in Wright Park. There's an inner circle for waking horses and outer circle for running horses.  ""Pony Boys"" will help and watch over you and the horse the whole time, to keep you safe.

Fun Fact:
The Filipino word for horse is kabayo – derived rom the Spanish word, caballo. Kabayo is also a Filipinos term for an ironing board, due to its horse-like shape.

Among its other great rulers were the Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas, Pandyas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara kings. When Kongunad fell to the British along with the rest of the state, its name was changed to Coimbatore.

Or take a boat from Manila to Caticlan.""

What is it?
While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

Fun Fact:
Children from Boracay are expert sand-castle makers, and for a small token you can ask them to sculpt one in the shape of your name or your sweetheart's!

We leave our empty drinks in our movie cinemas seats. Random tissue papers are always floating on MRT seats. We choke drains with our cigarrates. And we don't even think twice about it. Because garbage on the street is better than in our pockets. 

Some of us have become so entitled that we say we ""help"" the cleaners by giving them a ""job"" to do. That's when you know something is wrong. Maybe that's why we don't return our food trays.

I'm guilty for being part of those groups at parties who don't clean up well, leaving cleaners with a ton of extra work to do. It seems normal when no one seems to care. But I'm not going to act that way again. 

Let us know if you want to do something about littering by leaving a comment or by sharing this video so more people see it.

While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

The fact that there are 35,000 elderly living alone in Singapore today. This number includes the elderly who are in poor health, disabled, have been abandoned by their children and those that need help to get by day to day. Just last year, a 81-year-old man believed to have fallen in the kitchen was found dead by his neighbours in his Jurong Flat. And this is only one of the cases reported. As our population grows, the number of elderly living alone is projected to increase to 83,000 in 2030 and we hope more awareness can be made for this issue. 

Here is a video recapping our day at Project Homeworks, an initiative started by Habitat for Humanity to improve the living condition of the elderly, the sick and the physically-challenged living at one-room flats all over the island. Habitat for Humanity is a non-profit organisation that was started in 1976 and they envision a world where everyone has a decent place to live.

Calanggaman Island, Leyte

What is it like? 
By those who know about it, this ten-hectare hidden gem is adored for its supremely fine white sands. But the real adventure begins below the surface – with up to 30-meter visibility and an expansive reef, this marine reserve also provides a mystifying dive experience.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Calbayog or Tacloban.                                           Or take a bus from Manila to Tacloban.                                           Or take a boat from Cebu to Calbayog or Ormoc.

Fun Fact: 
The island gets its name from the Cebuano word for bird, possibly owing to the two sandbars that stretch out like wings from its shores.

Tubbataha Reef, Palawan

What is it? 
Schooling is when a group of fish swim together in one direction. They do this to fend off predators by creating a “confusion effect,” where it becomes harder for a predator to focus on one single prey. In Tubbataha, there are 11 species of sharks and 13 species of dolphins and whales that prey on smaller fish. 

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

Fun Fact: 
Shoaling is different from schooling. Shoaling is when a species of fish are grouped close together, but are swimming independently. Tubbataha has 600 species of fish that either school or shoal.

Every August, Alappuzha comes to life with an adrenaline-pumping event that sees huge, low slung chundan vellams (snake boats), rowed by up to 100 people, compete for the Nehru Cup.

Here's something different for our readers. In Singapore, most of us go through our lives like drones, getting all our ""skills"" from textbooks. But we never pay attention to the skills that will truly help us in life. The ones that matter. Like making new friends, building relationships and pushing ourselves off that ledge of comfort that we desperately cling on to. We fear the unknown and unfamiliar.

So where do you start? That's why we decided to write this guide.

Go out there and start talking to people. Rake up some smiles, meet your new business partner, talk to that cute boy/girl in line, find out about a cool new bar and so much more.

Guyam is a small deserted island of the coast of Siargao near General Luna. The island is visited daily by visitors on a boattrip or who come to just chill out for a while. It's a perfect little island with no facilities exept a toilet and 2 shelters. For a small fee the owner will allow people to stay on the island overnight. I've been in Siargao for over 2 months, the vibe of the island and the beauty of the surrounding islands make Siargao and incredible and addicting island. For a while have I been planning the right time to visit this island during the time when the milky way would be visible ánd when there would be no light pollution of the moon, also trying to lucky with clear weather. 

The milky is not visible like this with your own eyes, it is because of long exposure shots (20 seconds) that details of the milky way become visible and with postprocessing details and contrast are further enhanced. The settings used are ISO 1600, f2.8, shutterspeed of 20seconds. I used a D800 and 14-24mm lens, but any DSLR can capture this and even a good compact camera with RAW abilities.

The zip line enables visitors to cross the narrow straits between both islands in about 30 to 40 seconds.

The starting point of the line begins from the top of a hill at Pulau Gaya, (about 45m above sea level) and riders gradually descend to a 8m-high platform at Pulau Sapi.

The zip line operates between 10am and 4pm daily.

In this article, we try something different by highlighting one of the more niche trades in Singapore.

To the public eye, tattoos are a taboo. The idea of leaving a permanent visual on one’s skin doesn’t favour with most people. 

But how many people see beyond the intimidating visuals and instead see fine artistry with a needle? What really goes on behind the parlour’s closed doors illuminated with lucid red lights? 

How often do we stereotype these artists from their trade and instead see them as living canvases of art?

In this article, we hope to answer these questions.

A city of many dimensions is what befits a description of Allahabad. In addition to being a major pilgrimage centre, the city has played an important part in the formation of modern India. Hindu mythology states that Lord Brahma, the creator god, chose a land for 'Prakrishta Yajna'. This land, at the confluence of three holy rivers - Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati, blessed by gods, came to be known as 'Prayag' or 'Allahabad'. 

Foreseeing the sanctity of the place, Lord Brahma also called it as 'Tirth Raj' or 'King of all pilgrimage centers’.' The Scriptures - Vedas and the great epics - Ramayana and Mahabharata, refer to this place as Prayag.

Centuries followed. Allahabad became the headquarters of North Western Provinces, after being shifted from Agra. Well preserved relics of the British impact include the Muir College and the All Saints Cathedral. 

Many important events in India's struggle for freedom, took place here - the emergence of the first Indian National Congress in 1885, the beginning of Mahatma Gandhi's non-violence movement in 1920.

Sanchi’s stupas, monasteries, temples and pillars dating from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The most famous of these monuments, Stupa 1, known as the Great Stupa, was originally built by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, the then governor of Ujjayini, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant from the adjacent town of Vidisha. Their son Mahindra and daughter Sanghamitra were born in Ujjayini and sent to Sri Lanka, where they converted to king, the queen and their people to Buddhism.

The Sanchi hill goes up in shelves with Stupa 2 situated on a lower shelf, Stupa 1, Stupa 3, the 5th century Gupta Temple No.17 and the 7th century temple No. 18 are on the intermediate shelf and a later monastery is on the crowning shelf. The balustrade surrounding Stupa 2, carved with aniconic representations of the Buddha, was added in the late 2nd century BC under the Satavahanas.

The adjacent Gupta temple no.17 was hailed by Sir John Marshall as one of the most rationally organized structures in Indian architecture. Though small, it was a herald of all the principles which went into the engineering of an Indian temple in the early medieval period. The Buddhas in the perambulatory surrounding Stupa 1 are not contemporary with the Stupa but belong to the Gupta period in the mid-5th century AD. The monastery and the temple with the tall pillars adjacent to Stupa 1 and the temple near the monastery on the crowning shelf illustrate the evolution of the architectural form after the 5th century Gupta temple.

 Cebu City, Visayas

How to Get There:
Fly to Cebu from Manila, Clark or any of the key cities in the country. There are also scheduled flights from Hongkong, Singapore, Narita in Japan and Incheon, South Korea.

Buses bound for Cebu leave from Dumaguete, Oriental Negros and Bacolod, Negros Occidental every hour.

It is also possible to take your car here via a Roll On-Roll Off (RORO) ferry. 

What is it?
Fiestas are the best parties. Even if they're celebrated in honor of saints, the costumes, street dancing, music and merrymaking are always great!

Fun Fact:
Three of the biggest fiestas in the Visayas are held each year in January in honor of Sto. Niño (Child Jesus) -- Sinulog in Cebu, Dinagyang in Iloilo and Ati-atihan in Aklan.

Celebrations are carried out on November 15th for boys who reach the age of 3 or 5, or for girls who turn 3 or 7 years old. The custom is for the children to dress in their best clothes and to carry Chitose-ame which are long thin candy sticks colored in red and white, believed to bring good luck.

The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

Manipur is blessed with an amazing variety of flora and fauna, with over 67 percent of its geographical area being hill tracts covered by forests. There are 500 varieties of orchids which grow in Manipur of which 472 have been identified, in addition to 'Siroi Lily' which is the only terrestrial lily grown on the hill tops of Siroi hill, Ukhrul.

However, the most unique is the Sangai, the dancing deer. The floating mass of vegetation on the Loktak Lake sustains small herds of this endemic deer which unfortunately has the dubious distinction of being the most threatened Cervid (known as Phumdi) in the world.

Mumbai is a fascinating city, a compact mix of the traditional and the modern. A lively and varied place, this waterfront city, also the capital of Maharashtra, boasts a vibrant and cosmopolitan identity. Few cities in the world leave the tourists with such vivid impressions, whether it's the glitz and glamour of 'Bollywood', the spectacular array of Victorian buildings of the British Raj, the seaside rendezvous on the Juhu Beach, or the maze of alleyways and lively streets of Mumbai. 

For many tourists, however, its world-class museums and galleries - notably the superb Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalay, with its collection of the antiquities, - are reason enough to visit. 

This blend of old and new worlds makes for a fascinating exploration of the city's streets. An orientation of Mumbai is best begun from the Gateway of India, the most famous colonial landmark While Mumbai itself could take a lifetime to explore, it's also ideal as a base for visiting beautiful rock-cut Shiva temple on Elephanta Island - a short trip by launch across the harbor offering some respite from the frenetic activity of the city.

Clark, Pampanga

What is it? 
It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

How to get there: 
Fly into Clark from Incheon, Singapore, or Hong Kong.

Or take a bus from Pasay or Cubao.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.

In March of 1991, a series of earthquakes occurred for nearly 3 months, evidently showing that Mt. Pinatubo was about to erupt. On June 15, the volcano went down in history for having the second largest terrestrial explosion of the 20th century, effects of which were felt worldwide. 

Fun Fact:
The volcano's crater is now a favorite tourist destination of hikers (even the amateur ones, thanks to the fairly easy trails)! A refreshing dip in the lake awaits those who want to cool down after hours of hiking. Kayaks are available too!

Siargao, Surigao del Norte

What is it?
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact:
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

Bijapur experienced a great burst of architectural activity under the Adil Shahi rulers. It is also famous for the hand-made sarees of llkal. Bijapur is also the best base from which to see other exceptional heritage sites such as Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal.

Mr. Trump,

I try my hardest not to be political.  I’ve refused to interview several of your fellow candidates.  I didn’t want to risk any personal goodwill by appearing to take sides in a contentious election.  I thought: ‘Maybe the timing is not right.’  But I realize now that there is no correct time to oppose violence and prejudice.  The time is always now.  Because along with millions of Americans, I’ve come to realize that opposing you is no longer a political decision.  It is a moral one. 

I’ve watched you retweet racist images.  I’ve watched you retweet racist lies.  I’ve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy.  I’ve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to ‘pay the legal fees’ of those who commit violence on your behalf.  I’ve watched you advocate the use of torture and the murder of terrorists’ families.   I’ve watched you gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.   I’ve watched you compare refugees to ‘snakes,’ and claim that ‘Islam hates us.’  

I am a journalist, Mr. Trump.  And over the last two years I have conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of Muslims, chosen at random, on the streets of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.  I’ve also interviewed hundreds of Syrian and Iraqi refugees across seven different countries.  And I can confirm— the hateful one is you.  

Those of us who have been paying attention will not allow you to rebrand yourself.  You are not a ‘unifier.’  You are not ‘presidential.’  You are not a ‘victim’ of the very anger that you’ve joyfully enflamed for months.  You are a man who has encouraged prejudice and violence in the pursuit of personal power.  And though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are.

Additionally, the Asahikawa Heiwa-dori Shopping Street in Asahikawa City, Hokkaido, introduced the new tax-free system on June 1, 2015. 
Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5,001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10,001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district.

For example, buy some Japanese teas, a kimono and anything else you fancy on the shopping street, and when you have finished shopping, just go to the tax refund counter in Seibu Department Store. Enjoy shopping at bargain prices, and take a little taste of Japan back home with you.

Asahikawa City has many other attractions besides shopping, and also a great destination for travelling. Please come and visit!

Anilao, Batangas

What is it?
Funny how a dive site that has the Tagalog word of garbage for its name is one of the best dive spots in Anilao. A lot of interesting creatures can be spotted in Basura — octopuses, seahorses, tiny frogfishes, ghost pipefish, and tiny shrimps. This area is classified as a muck dive site, hiding all those species under a viscous sea of mud. Come to think of it, the name's making a little more sense now.

Fun Fact:
You can go for a diving expedition to a Spanish galleon which sank in 1620. Visibility is good, and the site is home to many beautiful fish and corals. Just ask your tour guides to show you the way.

What is it? 
Tubbataha Reef is the mecca of Philippine diving, and a superstar in the international diving scene. It's accessible only by live-aboard dive boats between the months of March and June. You have the chance to marvel at 11 species of sharks, over 600 species of fish, 360 species of coral, 12 kinds of whales and dolphins, and get this — 10,000 hectares of reefs.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa, then take a live-aboard boat to Tubbataha.

Fun Fact:
Aside from being a marine sanctuary, Tubbataha is also renowned for being a bird sanctuary. A lighthouse islet, at the southern tip of the South Atoll, supports a large number of seabirds which nest there.
