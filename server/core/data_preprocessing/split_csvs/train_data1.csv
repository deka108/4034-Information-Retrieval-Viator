""I saw your recent post regarding future Singapore MRT/LRT maps and thought I‚Äôd throw mine into the ring. The Singapore MRT has long been one of my fave metro systems around the world. 

I like the concept of destination numbers and station numbers - I believe it is one of the first, if not the first, to use this concept (do let me know if that‚Äôs not quite right).  

My approach for this map is to incorporate the station number into the station marker itself to avoid some of the clutter associated placing the station name AND the number alongside the station marker.  

Also, I really wanted the Circle Line to be a circle, so I have adopted a few distortions to make that happen. Finally, I tried to incorporate geography of Singapore in a stylistic manner to further reinforce the circle motif.

Manipur is blessed with an amazing variety of flora and fauna, with over 67 percent of its geographical area being hill tracts covered by forests. There are 500 varieties of orchids which grow in Manipur of which 472 have been identified, in addition to 'Siroi Lily' which is the only terrestrial lily grown on the hill tops of Siroi hill, Ukhrul.

However, the most unique is the Sangai, the dancing deer. The floating mass of vegetation on the Loktak Lake sustains small herds of this endemic deer which unfortunately has the dubious distinction of being the most threatened Cervid (known as Phumdi) in the world.

With the influx of people who travel, how can you say you got a meaningful travel escape? For @Vin_Aranas87, it's meeting new people and experiencing their culture and way of life.

""Last year, I had the chance to travel to Batanes with my friend, and the chance to experience Itbayat was a big tick off my travel bucket list. There we met Nanay Cano, a resident who operates a small lodging house. She is a retired teacher who also used to be a tourism officer in Itbayat. She fondly shared with us stories how she managed to juggle both responsibilities back in the day and how her love of Itbayat made it light for her to attend to her duties.

""Tourism has been a great help for her. Through tourism, she is able to practice her teaching profession she has always loved by imparting to her guests how to fully enjoy their stay in her hometown.""

These are successful stories of our tourism frontliners who prove how inclusive the tourism industry can be. Their stories are told by various local travelers around the Philippines whose journey would not have been more fun and much easier without the help they got from their newfound friends.

This week, we begin with the story of Jacob Maentz (@jacob.maentz on Instagram), a documentary and travel photographer from Cebu:

""I met Captain Angel Torres in Bais Bay during an early morning excursion to see the dolphins of Ta√±on Strait. Ta√±on Strait lies between Negros Oriental and Cebu and is the largest protected seascape in the country. It is home to spinner dolphins, dwarf sperm whales, spotted dolphins and pygmy killer whales. Today, a number of fishermen and other locals work part-time as captains or crew for some 15 boat tours around Ta√±on Strait, Angel being one of them. Visitors can get a glimpse of the marine mammals during early morning dolphin-watching trips.

""Back in the early 90‚Äôs dolphin meat was sold for P10 per kilo and was a common part of the local diet. Marine species would also be hunted for pure sport, mainly because no one knew any better explained Angel. In the mid-1990‚Äôs much of that changed when the LGU implemented a number of environmental laws to protect the dolphins and whales in the area.  Tourism now provides a livelihood for local fishermen and the marine life is better protected. ""

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Antichak in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar is an archaeological site containing the remains of the famous Buddhist monastery and university of Vikramshila, an important centre of learning in the 8th century. Founded by Pala ruler Dharampala, Vikramshila was a great centre of Vajrayana Buddhism. It was as a result of missions sent from this monastery that the Vajrayana form of Buddhism was established in Tibet in the 11th century AD. The monastery consisted of a very large complex of buildings including splendid temples and stupas. In the excavations carried out in 1960-61, a number of Buddha images of stone and terracotta have been discovered.

We have been informed by MOE that the school actually requires approval from MOE before visiting and we understood the ""enter at your own risk"" sign wrongly. It is that way as it is meant to be open for residents nearby to jog along the driveways and also to provide a shortcut for nearby residents to reach the bus-stop along Braddel Road. Any un-approved visit from MOE by any public would be seen as trespassing and will be prosecuted by Police.

It is also now being guarded by security guards 24 hours daily.

The former Braddell-Westlake Secondary School has been abandoned since 2005, and as with abandoned places, eerie vibes here are at an all-time high.  The amazing thing about this place? Unlike most abandoned places, the gates here are opened with the disclaimer ""Enter at your own risk"" instead of ""Trespassers will be prosecuted."" Yay!

Graffitied walls, shattered windows and dusty floors are a dead giveaway on this place‚Äôs inhabitants. Or lack thereof. One more desolated location to check off your photography bucket list!

Calle Crisologo is considered the Philippines' most beautiful street. It's paved with cobblestones and lined with well-preserved Spanish ancestral homes.

And you can even ride on one for a full-on blast-from-the-past experience. Calle Crisologo is one of the five places in the Philippines that have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Fun Fact:
An urban legend in Vigan tells the story of a Japanese general who fell in love with a Filipina who lived there. He married her, and they had a family. To protect them, he promised the parish priest that he would save the town from being destroyed by the war if the priest would keep his family safe.

Dubbed as the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines, its deep waters teem with marine life and an abundance of corals and reefs. For non-divers ‚Äì the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

Fun Fact: 
Diving conditions in Anilao are ideal for divers of all experience levels. The water temperature is consistently warm, and the surface is typically calm and smooth throughout the year.

It was a shock. Not in terms of the changes, but the realization of how much Singapore means to me. While away in my country by birth, every negative thought always led to the feeling of ‚ÄúI want to go home‚Äù, even though I was technically at home. The moment I touched down at Changi Airport, I finally know why. The familiar sight, and sound; though Singapore isn't my passport country, I feel I truly belong here. Despite my family living thousands of kilometres away, I feel at peace here.

What is it like? 
‚ÄúThe Oblation‚Äù is the popular icon of the University of the Philippines. It‚Äôs a concrete sculpture of an almost naked man facing skyward with his arms outstretched. The statue symbolizes selfless dedication to the nation.

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.                                        Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.                                                Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.                                                  Then take a taxi, jeepney or bus to Quezon City.

Fun Fact: 
To celebrate the university‚Äôs 100th anniversary, some of its alumni launched an art exhibit called ‚Äú100 Nudes / 100 Years,‚Äù inspired by the Oblation.

There were two boats leaving that day and we got on the first one. But before departure, I realised one of the boys had left his comfort pillow on the dock, so we went back out to get it. He would be inconsolable without it. 

Well we found the pillow but before we could get back to our seats, they announced our boat was leaving. The security officers refused to let us back on even though our things were on board.

'Don't worry madam, you can take the next boat. They are both going to the same place.'

So our belongings left without us and we got on the second boat.  But not long after leaving the harbour, the first ship was sunk by the Japanese. We survived but were captured and sent to an internment camp in one of the nearby islands. 

But my husband didn't know we had changed ships. He thought we had all been killed.

The camp was a terrible place. Many died and there was not enough food. And I didn't have milk for my youngest who was still a baby. We gave him rice water but he was poorly.

By luck, after many months in camp, I met a boy who recognised me. He was a Malay lad who my husband used to tutor in English. He was not imprisoned so he got word back to my husband that we were alive.  My husband was then able to get us released and we returned to Singapore. 

After that, I had to stay at home in order to be safe.  Because I am Caucasian, the Japanese said they could take me away to Changi prison for no reason. 'Any time we want, we can come for you.' So all those years until the end of the war,  I never showed my face outside to remind them I existed. And gladly they forgot me. 

I have had many blessings. I must thank God for a good husband. I met him when I was 17 and it was love at first sight.  My parents did not want me to marry a Chinese boy but eventually they grew to love him the way I did. They came to know what I knew, that he was a wonderful, wonderful man.

Pasay, Metro Manila

What is it like? 
On the first day of September, the Filipino Christmas season unofficially begins. Christmas trees and star-shaped lanterns start to fill the streets. Schools start to put together plays about the birth of Jesus Christ. Christmas remixes of the year's most popular songs start to play on the radio. The whole country is transformed for a solid four months. It's the longest Christmas celebration in the world. And it also has a good claim to being the happiest. 

How to get there: 
Fly into Manila through one of more than 30 international airlines. You can also fly in from any major Philippine city.

Or take a bus from any major city in Luzon.

Or take a boat from any major Philippine port.

Fun Fact: 
Adults or children form groups and visit homes at night to sing carols. When given change, young carolers typically sing a thank-you song in Filipino that goes, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so kind, thank you!"" When given change money, the song changes to, ""Thank you, thank you, you're so stingy, thank you!""

Boracay, Aklan

What is it like? 
Ah, Boracay. Need we say more? Since much has been said, raved and written about this famous four-kilometer stretch of powder white sand paradise, we would like to suggest you try the most exhilarating activity off it ‚Äî cliff-diving at Ariel's Point. The highest plank is about 15 meters high, which is as high as a five-storey building. But a jump off it ends with a safe, pleasantly wet landing.

Fun Fact: 
Not a lot of people know that Tribal Adventure Day Tours are offered on this island. These are no ordinary tours. You spend an entire day getting to know the indigenous people living In the area. The women will welcome you into their homes and even cook for your group while you learn about their history and customs. Ask around for D'Arcy Kelly. He runs the show.

Located at the base of spectacular Girnar Hills, Junagadh, headquarters of the district of the same name, is an ancient fortified city, rich in myth and legend. A princely state in British India, the place is named after the ‚ÄòOld Fort‚Äô which encircled the old city.
The presence of 14 Rock Edicts of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka cut into a big rock outside the city bears testimony to its antiquity and attracts the historically minded. One of the reasons for visiting Junagadh is to transit to Sasangir, the entrancing preserve of Asiatic lion or to tour the beautiful shrine of Somnath.

Check out his HONEST review of his visit to some of the Philippines' top destinations, including Bohol, Cebu, Palawan, and Siquijor, through this Vlog and we hope you too get to experience how MORE FUN it is in the Philippines!

P.S. Just some minor corrections and suggestions:

(1) On the duration of tourist visa:
a foreign traveller can actually stay in the Philippines visa-free for 30 days and not 21 days, as stated in the video.

(2) The whole of Mindanao is not unsafe and there are equally beautiful touristic destinations one could visit in there such as Siargao, which is becoming a world surf haven; Cagayan de Oro, known for the wild river rafting; Davao, where the Philippines' highest peak, Mt. Apo, could be trekked; Camiguin, where you could swim in a carbonated water, and many more! :-)

The temples of Khajuraho are India's unique gift to the world, representing, as they do, a paean to life, to love, to joy, perfect in execution and sublime in expression. Life, in every form and mood, has been captured in stone, testifying not only to the craftsman's artistry but also to the extraordinary breadth of vision of the Chandela Rajputs under whose rule the temples were conceived and constructed. The Khajuraho temples were built in the short span of a hundred years, from 950-1050 AD in truly inspired burst of creativity. Of the 85 original temples, 22 have survived till today to constitute one of the world's great artistic wonders.

Because no one really believes""every school is a good school"".

It's that time of the year again where you look at school rankings that try not to have rankings but fail because everyone just looks at rankings and if there isn't an official ranking, people will make one up and the one that makes the most sense would become the unofficial, official ranking.

""Good"" is a relative position on a spectrum. For there to be ""Good"" schools, there have to be ""Bad"" schools too. That being said, academic results alone do not determine a ""good"" school. There are many other factors like environment, suitability, quality of staff, location etc. But certainly, some schools are better then others. And what's a ""Good school"" to you may be ""Bad"" to another.

Anilao, Batangas

How to Get There:
Take a bus to Batangas from Cubao or Pasay.

What is it?
The town of Anilao may not have white sand beaches, but its underwater environment is its biggest attraction. Dubbed as the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines, its deep waters teem with marine life and an abundance of corals and reefs. For non-divers ‚Äì the shallow and low-current waters are great for snorkeling. Dive and Trek's house reef is a marine sanctuary frequented by several snorkelers.

Fun Fact:
Diving conditions in Anilao are ideal for divers of all experience levels. The water temperature is consistently warm, and the surface is typically calm and smooth throughout the year.

What is it like?
The Danao Adventure Park offers eco-adventure tourism lovers another face of Bohol. Some of the many varied activities include kayaking, river trekking, rappelling, rock climbing, and visits to cultural heritage sites.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Tagbilaran.

Or take the Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) ferry from Cebu to Tagbilaran.

Or take a boat from Cebu or any of the major cities in Mindanao to Tagbilaran.

Then take a bus or van to Danao.

Fun Fact: 
The zipline in Danao is the Philippines's longest and tallest, running half a kilometer from one mountain to another. Only for the most hardcore adventurers, the zipline has been dubbed the ""sui-slide."" It's certainly not for the faint of heart.

Celebrations are carried out on November 15th or the month of November for boys who reach the age of 3 or 5, or for girls who turn 3 or 7 years old. The custom is for the children to dress in their best clothes and to carry ‚ÄúChitose-ame‚Äù which are long thin candy sticks colored in red and white, believed to bring good luck.

Until now, it was necessary to perform the tax-free procedure each time for every one store visited. But in the new system, tax-free procedure can be combined with the goods purchased in multiple stores, such as within shopping streets.

Previously, to qualify for the tax refund, purchasing of consumables had to exceed 5, 001yen (excluding tax), while shopping of general goods worth more than 10, 001yen (excluding tax) all in one individual shop. However, the new system allows visitors to receive tax-refund for purchases not only from a single store, but the total purchases of a local shopping district. 

It would be a pleasure to introduce Okayama City as the first shopping spot in Japan where you will have this new Tax-free system benefit.
At the tax-free stores in Omotemachi Shopping Street and Romantic-dori Shopping Street, you may purchase Japanese traditional sweets, tea utensils or Japanese tea, and then operating procedure tax refund at the tax-free counter of Tenmaya department store.

Bodhgaya, the most important site of Buddhist pilgrimage in the world, is situated in the state of Bihar. 

The place is a sacred site of the first order, and its central temple, the UNESCO World Heritage listed Mahabodhi Temple, is an obligatory stop on the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit. 

Adjacent to the Mahabodhi Temple is the Bodhi tree itself under which Prince Siddhartha Gautama is said to have attained Enlightenment 2,500 years ago. As a result he became the Buddha - the Enlightened One. Bodh Gaya or Uruvela, as it was known during Buddha‚Äôs times, is also a major pilgrimage centre for Hindus as Buddha is considered to be the ninth incarnation of Vishnu.

Mumbai is a fascinating city, a compact mix of the traditional and the modern. A lively and varied place, this waterfront city, also the capital of Maharashtra, boasts a vibrant and cosmopolitan identity. Few cities in the world leave the tourists with such vivid impressions, whether it's the glitz and glamour of 'Bollywood', the spectacular array of Victorian buildings of the British Raj, the seaside rendezvous on the Juhu Beach, or the maze of alleyways and lively streets of Mumbai.

For many tourists, however, its world-class museums and galleries - notably the superb Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalay, with its collection of the antiquities, - are reason enough to visit.

This blend of old and new worlds makes for a fascinating exploration of the city's streets. An orientation of Mumbai is best begun from the Gateway of India, the most famous colonial landmark While Mumbai itself could take a lifetime to explore, it's also ideal as a base for visiting beautiful rock-cut Shiva temple on Elephanta Island - a short trip by launch across the harbor offering some respite from the frenetic activity of the city.

Amritsar, literally a Pool of Nectar, derives its name from Amrit Sarovar, the holy tank that surrounds the splendid Golden Temple. Guru Ramdas, the fourth Guru of the Sikh faith, founded Amritsar in 1579. He constructed a pool on land gifted by the Mughal Emperor Akbar and called it Amritsar. 

Home to the world famous Golden Temple, the 400-year-old city of Amritsar is the most important seat of Sikh history and culture. 

One of the most poignant memorials of free India -- Jallianwala Bagh ‚Äì is also located in the city. Amritsar district was once a part of the vast area covered by the Indus valley Civilisation during the early period of history.

Dining In The Dark KL reinvents the way you experience food by making you depend on other senses besides sight and having blind staff members to wait on you. Not only does this make you put away your phones and iPads to focus on your partner; you also depend more on each other as the meal progresses. How many times can you say you had a romantic Valentine‚Äôs Day in complete darkness? :)

Clark, Pampanga

What is it? 
It's amusing to see that something as serious-sounding as ""the biggest aviation sports event in the country"" consists of giant flying animals, flowers and cartoon characters. It's serious business though. The annual Hot Air Balloon Festival attracts around 100,000 visitors from all around the world every February. The festival also features other activities like skydiving, flag jumping, aerobatics and even aircraft demonstrations.

How to get there: 
Fly into Clark from Incheon, Singapore, or Hong Kong.

Or take a bus from Pasay or Cubao.

Fun Fact: 
The festival was launched in 1994, three years after the devastating Mt. Pinatubo eruption, to help boost the local economy and uplift the spirit of the Central Luzon region. And it has been a soaring success ever since.
