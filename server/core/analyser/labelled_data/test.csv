Mostly known as the home of the iconic Mayon Volcano, Albay also offers a slew of nature parks and ruins from past eruptions of the famous volcano.

Fun Fact:

Vinta Regatta Festival, Zamboanga

How to Get There:
Fly into Zamboanga from Manila, Cebu or Davao.

Or take a boat to Zamboanga from Manila.

What is it?
A vinta's sail is made up of vertical stripes of assorted colors that represent the colorful history of the peninsula's Muslim community. About a third of its population is made up of ethnic communities that give the region its unique flavor. These include the Tausugs, Samals, Yakans, Badjaos, and Subanens. Wait until you start hearing the people speak Chabacano – arguably the suavest-sounding dialect because of its heavy Spanish influence.

Fun Fact:
Vinta is also the name of a Moro dance performed to commemorate the migration of the Filipinos. Dancers imitate the movement of the vintas by balancing on the tops of poles.

In addition to the common reason being staggering, natural light for film and photography, it's the rare window to behold a place's true character. This dawn was no exception, as I observed residents go about the beginning of their day undisturbed. Absorbing the culture in this way is what makes it all the more meaningful. Simply put, think twice before you hit that snooze button.

"*Important Update*
We have been informed by MOE that the school actually requires approval from MOE before visiting and we understood the ""enter at your own risk"" sign wrongly. It is that way as it is meant to be open for residents nearby to jog along the driveways and also to provide a shortcut for nearby residents to reach the bus-stop along Braddel Road. Any un-approved visit from MOE by any public would be seen as trespassing and will be prosecuted by Police.

It is also now being guarded by security guards 24 hours daily.
Please do not visit this area anymore or try to enter.

*End of update*
Original post is as follows below.
--------------

The former Braddell-Westlake Secondary School has been abandoned since 2005, and as with abandoned places, eerie vibes here are at an all-time high.  The amazing thing about this place? Unlike most abandoned places, the gates here are opened with the disclaimer ""Enter at your own risk"" instead of ""Trespassers will be prosecuted."" Yay!

Graffitied walls, shattered windows and dusty floors are a dead giveaway on this place’s inhabitants. Or lack thereof. One more desolated location to check off your photography bucket list!

Directions: Take a train to Braddell MRT, then walk towards blk 209 and follow the sheltered walkway.

"Where is it? 
Puerto Princesa, Palawan

What is it like? 
When fish swim in the same direction and in a coordinated manner, the behavior is called ""schooling."" But when they're together, interacting, it's called ""shoaling"". Fish shoal for protection against predators, better chances of finding food, and better chances of finding a mate – a shoalmate! You can watch schools or shoals of fish when you go snorkeling in Puerto Princesa's marine attractions, such as Honda Bay.

Fun Fact: 
Fish don't just randomly join a group. Like people, they pick who to hang out with – who their mates will be. And generally, they like large shoals with fish who are healthy and resemble their appearance. This is because a fish that stands out will be easy prey.

One beneficiary from such phenomenon is Kuya Rudy Hecho, a driver and tour guide from Sabtang Island in Batanes, whose story is told by Nethaneel Jao (@thedeafmutespeaks).

""Driving over the steep cliffs of Sabtang Island, Batanes in a cogon-roofed tricycle is probably one of the most memorable moments in my traveling life. Every turn of the road was another breathtaking scenery, and every village, new faces.

""My driver and tour guide, Kuya Rudy Hecho, has been living in Sabtang for as long as he can remember. So much so that he's gotten used to the incredible landscapes that have brought in many tourists for the past years. And in between our cheery conversations about the Ivatan culture and some pointers on common Ivatan courtesies and words, he would tell me how tourism in the island has boomed over the past decade.

""Flocks of visitors would come every month, amazed by the grandeur of Batanes. With his unique and charming cogon-roofed tricycle, he offers guided tours around his home island, as well as accommodations for those who wish to spend the night in Sabtang. With this, he is able to support his family and, at the same time, share with his guests a part of his wonderful culture and the joys of a simple life for them to bring home as priceless memories.

"To anyone who has shared moments over socials with our local mountain guides, exchanging stories in the campsite under starlit skies or along the trails, I'm sure one way or another, you've heard them share about how much their livelihoods have been helped by being a guide or a porter.

Carrying one's heavy pack along with the items of the rest of the group throughout the duration of the trek, which could last up to 10 or more hours per day depending on the trail, is something mountain guides and porters are willing to sacrifice for in exchange for a better source of income.

Where majority of our provincial lands' main source of livelihood rest in farming or fishing, most of these guides go back to such labor when they have no group to guide in the mountains.

But being a guide can earn four to five times more than what one can earn from fishing or farming in a day, and that is why they are willing to make the sacrifice and even eager to do so. At night in the campsite, they take shots of local rum, not to get drunk, but to ease their bodies from the pain and protect themselves from the cold. 

With better accessibility to the mountains, locals who lead groups visiting as guides or as porters, certainly have a better chance of living, and more money to feed their families.

We shouldn't take it against them for making a decent living out of being a guide or a porter. While there are those local communities who sadly and unfortunately abuse this opportunity, there are still those who do not and are very adamant about providing job opportunities for the locals while at the same time preserving the natural habitat of the mountains in their community.

From among these are the guides I met in Kanlaon Volcano in Negros. They limit climbers to 10 per day and require permits for any mountaineer visiting. They uphold the model for responsible mountaineering.

More than 200 years ago, there were many posting stations where people had rest and spend a night on their way to Edo or Kyoto.
Some of the stations remain still on this NAKASENDO route, and these posting stations connected with each other by a hiking trail.

"WELCOME TO AMRITSAR @spiritofindiarun
Inextricably linked with the history of Sikhism, Amritsar is amongst the most revered sites of the world. It was founded as recently as the 16th century. Its name is a derivative of the Amrit Sarovar (pool of nectar) amidst which stands the Golden Temple, the most sacred of Sikh shrines. Accounts suggest that Guru Amardas purchased the land from Emperor Akbar and decided to build a tank at the site. Following his death, it was completed by Guru Ramdas and also came to be known as Chak Ramdas or Guru ka Chak. Some of the oldest markets in Amritsar, notably Guru ka Bazaar, date back to his time. The construction of the Golden Temple was initiated by Guru Arjan Dev while Guru Hargobind, who accorded the religion a martial temper, built the Akal Takht in 1606. Amritsar has a rich history encompassing various mythical and historical narratives including the epic Ramayana. It is believed that the site called Ram Tirath was Maharish Valmiki’s ashram, where Sita reportedly gave birth to her twin sons, Luv and Kush. The Gobindgarh Fort and Ram Bagh were built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire. While the Jallianwala Bagh continues to be the most evocative monument to India’s freedom struggle. The Khalsa College, established by visionary leaders at the beginning of the 20th century turned Amritsar into a hub of education. Also a centre of thriving industry since its inception, Amritsar is famed for its textiles, particularly shawls, and for its carpets. Amritsar has gained tremendous popularity for its gourmet traditions; especially the dhabas (roadside eatery) that churn out, amongst an inexhaustible list of delicacies, irresistible kulchas, chola-bhaturas, tandoori chicken and fried fish. Amritsar has all the makings of a well-rounded tourist destination; its ancient legends, historical monuments, places of worship, old bazaars, theatre traditions and colourful festivals all serve as a window to its robust past. Excursions to the Harike Bird Sanctuary and visits to the India-Pakistan border at Wagah are an absolute delight, while breaking bread or celebrating Diwali with the denizens of this hospitable city is without parallel.(Courtesy Punjab Tourism) ",

It is surrounded by a number of smaller islands locally called Gili, e.g.  Gili Trawangan, Gili Air, and Gili Mano which offering more beaches, reefs for diving and snorkeling, as well as a sea turtle hatchery. 

The island’s topography is dominated by the centrally—located stratovolcano Mount Rinjani, the second highest volcano in Indonesia which rises to 3,726 m (12,224 ft). The volcano and its crater lake, “Segara Anak” (Child of the Sea), are protected by the Gunung Rinjani National Park which established in 1997.

"Where is it?
Siargao, Surigao del Norte

What is it?
The Philippines isn’t a major surf destination yet. That means more waves for you. We recommend hitting the beaches of Siargao, the country's surfing capital. Its popular surfing points have interesting names: Jack Horse, Quiksilver and the famous Cloud 9 — known for its thick, perfect hollow tubes. It’s only been a few decades since American surf enthusiasts brought their boards to the Philippines, but our beaches have really taken to surf culture. As they should. They’ve got water and waves to spare.

Fun Fact:
International surfers call Cloud 9's perfect tubes as ""the special wave."" The wave was discovered by traveling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named and made famous by American photographer John S. Callahan.

There are even methods to stay cool while sleeping.

"nanIt is with a heavy heart to announce that we have lost another one of our mountain guides, Joseph Selungin, age 33, in the wake of Sabah Earthquake that jolted Mt.Kinabalu.

The earthquake that rocked the mountain on the 5th of June, 7:15am triggered landslides along with rocks and boulders that tumbled down, destroying trails and sadly, taking lives. Joseph was found beneath a boulder, in the heroic act of shielding two of his guests. Unfortunately, the three of them didn’t survive.

Joseph was last seen hugging two of his guests, in an attempt to protect them, using his body as a shield, an account related by his fellow mountain guide colleague, Sharulnizam Suhaji. Sharulnizam describes Joseph as an easy-going person with a good heart, soft-spoken and always kind. 

Joseph has been a member of our team for almost 2 months. He has brought nothing but good memories and experiences for our fellow climbers. A man of courage and uncompromising thoughtfulness. His good-will and high-spirits will forever be remembered by all the lives he has touched.

Joseph left behind a loving wife, a 4-year old son and a 2-year old daughter. He promised his wife that he will come back to celebrate their wedding anniversary on the 12th of June. Our heartfelt condolences goes out to his family and to those affected. 
We will miss you Joseph, you live on in the love you gave, and the laughter you shared, in our thoughts and in our memories, forever.",

While Filipinos typically celebrate Christmas at home, some get away from the maddening rush and escape to nearby beaches like Boracay. Resorts and hotels prepare Christmas buffets for guests on Christmas eve and Christmas day, so they won't miss the traditional Noche Buena (Christmas feast). This is why December is considered by resorts and airlines as peak season, and you have to book your tickets and room way in advance.

"We've got a new office cat to accompany Pika over the lonely weekends. Introducing a new kitten to the resident cat can be tricky, but Fauzi the cat whisperer (HE HAS A LOT OF CATS!) is going to make the transition for them as easy possible! Hope it goes smoothly, we'll leave the stream up all day.

Any name suggestions for our new kitten?Our office cat Pika ? was getting lonely over the weekends. So we decided to get her a sister!

It's not easy to introduce a new kitten to the resident cat, but we have Fauzi cat whisperer extraordinaire to help with the transition. (He has A LOT of cats!).

Our plan is to first put in her a safe room with her litter, food and water so she feels secure and knows her food source is not threatened. After lunch, after she is used to her new area, we'll let her smell Pika's scent and vice versa. We're keeping Pika in another room for now so she doesn't see / scare her.

Later in the evening we'll show them each other and maybe at the end of the day if they are ready, they will meet. Otherwise, it'll be tomorrow! Pika is super chill and the kitten grew up with a lot of older cats so we don't foresee any problems!

Any name suggestions for our new cat?

"Have you heard of the Kyoto State Guest House?  It’s the national reception facility used to welcome foreign dignitaries and to offer them Japan’s finest omotenashi (Japanese-style hospitality).Located near the center of Kyoto (inside the Kyoto Imperial Garden), it finally opened its doors to the public in July of 2016!  The facility was built using a modern interpretation of traditional Japanese architecture and interior design. It features a variety of traditional arts and crafts such as urushi lacquer, Nishijin woven silks, bamboo woodwork, and so on. The garden is particularly impressive, as it was created using an ancient form of Japanese garden design which stresses teioku-ichinyo (the oneness of house and garden). Certainly a must-see!

Though closed on Wednesdays, daily guided tours in English will start at 12:30pm beginning February 6, 2017 (Mon). You, too, can experience this unique place which offers a royal dose of Japan’s legendary hospitality!

Here's something different for our readers. In Singapore, most of us go through our lives like drones, getting all our ""skills"" from textbooks.

Like making new friends, building relationships and pushing ourselves off that ledge of comfort that we desperately cling on to. We fear the unknown and unfamiliar.

Go out there and start talking to people. Rake up some smiles, meet your new business partner, talk to that cute boy/girl in line, find out about a cool new bar and so much more.

This famous cheese tart shop from Hokkaido creates their cheese tarts using 3 different types of cheese with ingredients flown in from Japan.

Be prepared to queue till the hype dies down. Are the cheese tarts really that good? Find out in our video below!
Note: You'll only be able to buy 12 pcs at a go for now! (2 boxes).

Address: ION Orchard #B4-33, S238801

The cookie-crust and combination of 3  cheeses makes the tarts taste exqusite, but it can get cloying afterawhile. So we recommend sharing and eating the tarts slowly.

--------------------------------
The only hill station in Rajasthan, Mount Abu is both a popular hill resort as well as a place of pilgrimage since the famous Dilwara Jain temples are located here. It is a pleasant green oasis of lush forested hills set in the barren desert scape of Rajasthan. 

Mount Abu is situated at the southern tip of the Aravali range, the hill retreat owes its cool climate to its rich flora covering the entire hillside that includes coniferous trees and flowering shrubs. During the period of the Maharajas, it was used as a place of leisure by the royalties. The place presents an interesting contrast of British style bungalows and holiday lodges with various tribal communities residing amidst the thick lush forest on the hills surrounding the region.

The island gets its name from the Cebuano word for bird, possibly owing to the two sandbars that stretch out like wings from its shores.
