"Do you know ""Maiko"" and ""Geiko""?
These are the specific names in Kyoto for the profession known as geisha. Maiko is a Geiko in training. Young women serve up to four years on apprenticeship as Maiko. The tradition of covering Maiko's faces with white powder means that they have not yet achieved full status. At some places in Kyoto, you can experience parties or events with Maiko's traditional dance performance, tea ceremony, etc.
 Join the special free English walking tour departing from Tourist Information Center (TIC) of JNTO, if you want to meet Maiko and experience the essence of Kyoto.

"To anyone who has shared moments over socials with our local mountain guides, exchanging stories in the campsite under starlit skies or along the trails, I'm sure one way or another, you've heard them share about how much their livelihoods have been helped by being a guide or a porter.

Carrying one's heavy pack along with the items of the rest of the group throughout the duration of the trek, which could last up to 10 or more hours per day depending on the trail, is something mountain guides and porters are willing to sacrifice for in exchange for a better source of income.

Where majority of our provincial lands' main source of livelihood rest in farming or fishing, most of these guides go back to such labor when they have no group to guide in the mountains.

But being a guide can earn four to five times more than what one can earn from fishing or farming in a day, and that is why they are willing to make the sacrifice and even eager to do so. At night in the campsite, they take shots of local rum, not to get drunk, but to ease their bodies from the pain and protect themselves from the cold. 

With better accessibility to the mountains, locals who lead groups visiting as guides or as porters, certainly have a better chance of living, and more money to feed their families.

We shouldn't take it against them for making a decent living out of being a guide or a porter. While there are those local communities who sadly and unfortunately abuse this opportunity, there are still those who do not and are very adamant about providing job opportunities for the locals while at the same time preserving the natural habitat of the mountains in their community.

From among these are the guides I met in Kanlaon Volcano in Negros. They limit climbers to 10 per day and require permits for any mountaineer visiting. They uphold the model for responsible mountaineering.

Guyam is a small deserted island of the coast of Siargao near General Luna. The island is visited daily by visitors on a boattrip or who come to just chill out for a while. It's a perfect little island with no facilities exept a toilet and 2 shelters. For a small fee the owner will allow people to stay on the island overnight. I've been in Siargao for over 2 months, the vibe of the island and the beauty of the surrounding islands make Siargao and incredible and addicting island. For a while have I been planning the right time to visit this island during the time when the milky way would be visible ??nd when there would be no light pollution of the moon, also trying to lucky with clear weather. 

The milky is not visible like this with your own eyes, it is because of long exposure shots (20 seconds) that details of the milky way become visible and with postprocessing details and contrast are further enhanced. The settings used are ISO 1600, f2.8, shutterspeed of 20seconds. I used a D800 and 14-24mm lens, but any DSLR can capture this and even a good compact camera with RAW abilities.

Calle Crisologo is considered the Philippines' most beautiful street. It's paved with cobblestones and lined with well-preserved Spanish ancestral homes.

And you can even ride on one for a full-on blast-from-the-past experience. Calle Crisologo is one of the five places in the Philippines that have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Fun Fact:
An urban legend in Vigan tells the story of a Japanese general who fell in love with a Filipina who lived there. He married her, and they had a family. To protect them, he promised the parish priest that he would save the town from being destroyed by the war if the priest would keep his family safe.

Kanchipuram, the golden city of a thousand temples, was once the capital of the Pallava dynasty. It is considered one of the seven sacred cities of India; some of the best temples were built here during the reign of the Pallavas between the 6th and 7th centuries. Subsequently, Kanchipuram also served as an important city of the far-flung empires of the Chola and the Vijayanagara dynasties.

Later, these dynasties too contributed greatly in the temple building activity of this town. 
The city has also been, through the years, a great seat of learning and culture. Adi Sankaracharya established his episcopal seat (Kamakodipeedam) here. Sri Sankaracharya, Appar, Siruthonder and the great Buddhist Bikshu, Bodhidharma, once lived and worked here. Today, it is known not only for temples but also for its hand-woven, silk fabrics.

"Smihastha Kumbh Mela 2016 (Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh)

The Simhastha Kumbh is an unrivalled celebration in India. The most popular legend regarding the origin of Kumbh Melas is the Samudra Manthan or 'churning of the ocean'. Gods and demons competed ¬ercely in the churning in search of the divine nectar of immortality. During this epic battle to capture the Urn (Kumbh) containing the nectar, drops of the precious liquid fell on four places – Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Nashik and Ujjain. Hence, river Kshipra became the enhancer of life and to celebrate this event since then the grand festival came in vogue. Kumbh Mela, is held once every twelve years at these four places and attracts millions of devotees.

Grand Simhastha, on the Ghats of the glorious Kshipra

The Ujjain Kumbh is celebrated when Jupiter ascends into sun sign Leo's quarter or the Simha constellation of zodiac, which is why it is called 'Simhastha'. The Simhastha is special in Ujjain as it is the seat of divine Mahakal - the Lord of all times. The ritual of bathing in the holy waters of Kshipra begins on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (March-April) and continues on various dates until the full moon shows up in the following month of Vaishakha.

Simhastha 2016 will begin on 22nd of April and will continue till 21st of May.

Sadhus of various sects from across the country assemble in Ujjain and mingle with ordinary people as they take their ritual dip in the holy waters of the Kshipra.! For moreinfo log on to http://www.mptourism.com/pdf-html/simhastha/index-su.html  (Image and info courtesy MP Tourism) ",2

Calanggaman Island, Leyte

What is it like? 
By those who know about it, this ten-hectare hidden gem is adored for its supremely fine white sands. But the real adventure begins below the surface – with up to 30-meter visibility and an expansive reef, this marine reserve also provides a mystifying dive experience.

How to get there: 
Fly from Manila to Calbayog or Tacloban. Or take a bus from Manila to Tacloban. Or take a boat from Cebu to Calbayog or Ormoc.

Fun Fact: 
The island gets its name from the Cebuano word for bird, possibly owing to the two sandbars that stretch out like wings from its shores.

"Bodhgaya - Buddhism’s most sacred and significant site
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bodhgaya, the most important site of Buddhist pilgrimage in the world, is situated in the state of Bihar. 

The place is a sacred site of the first order, and its central temple, the UNESCO World Heritage listed Mahabodhi Temple, is an obligatory stop on the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit. 

Adjacent to the Mahabodhi Temple is the Bodhi tree itself under which Prince Siddhartha Gautama is said to have attained Enlightenment 2,500 years ago. As a result he became the Buddha - the Enlightened One. Bodh Gaya or Uruvela, as it was known during Buddha’s times, is also a major pilgrimage centre for Hindus as Buddha is considered to be the ninth incarnation of Vishnu.

"Sanchi - Masterpieces of Buddhist Art

Sanchi’s stupas, monasteries, temples and pillars dating from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The most famous of these monuments, Stupa 1, known as the Great Stupa, was originally built by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, the then governor of Ujjayini, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant from the adjacent town of Vidisha. Their son Mahindra and daughter Sanghamitra were born in Ujjayini and sent to Sri Lanka, where they converted to king, the queen and their people to Buddhism.

The Sanchi hill goes up in shelves with Stupa 2 situated on a lower shelf, Stupa 1, Stupa 3, the 5th century Gupta Temple No.17 and the 7th century temple No. 18 are on the intermediate shelf and a later monastery is on the crowning shelf. The balustrade surrounding Stupa 2, carved with aniconic representations of the Buddha, was added in the late 2nd century BC under the Satavahanas.

The adjacent Gupta temple no.17 was hailed by Sir John Marshall as one of the most rationally organized structures in Indian architecture. Though small, it was a herald of all the principles which went into the engineering of an Indian temple in the early medieval period. The Buddhas in the perambulatory surrounding Stupa 1 are not contemporary with the Stupa but belong to the Gupta period in the mid-5th century AD. The monastery and the temple with the tall pillars adjacent to Stupa 1 and the temple near the monastery on the crowning shelf illustrate the evolution of the architectural form after the 5th century Gupta temple.

It has a gradually descending cliff, flat land, a ravine, caves, and has the commanding view of the sea.

The resort is a stylish boutique, which accounts for its exceptionality. Architecture of the building is decidedly Filipino with a splash of modern amenities. The thatched villas or ""balai"" in the dialect, are single-detached. These are built with sturdy construction materials, but the use of indigenous materials like bamboo, cogon, and wood is emphasized. Most of the villas have individual private swimming pools. The focal point of the resort is the infinity swimming pool, which definitely blends with the sea. The spacious restaurant has a cool feeling, yet with a warm ambience and plenty of the sea view and swimming pool view. Dining can also be at the beach al fresco, at the poolside and in the garden.

The centre of the park is dominated by the majestic Bandhavgarh Fort built in the 14th century, around which are numerous caves containing shrines and ancient Sanskrit inscriptions. The park has four main entrances, Panpatha in the north, Tala in the east (most of the hotels are located in Tala), Dhamokar in the south-west and Khitauli in the west. Two roads, Umaria-Rewa highway and Parasi-Katni road via Khitauli pass through the park. Tala is a small village on the Umaria-Rewa state highway. 

The Original home of all the white tigers alive, today, Bandhavgarh was the hunting ground of the Maharajas of Rewa; their old fort still dominates a hill in the forest. These white tigers were found in the old state of Rewa for many years. The last known tiger was captured by Maharaja Martand Singh in 1951. The White Tiger, Mohan, is now stuffed and on display in the palace of the Maharaja of Rewa.

"The Blue Lagoon Oludeniz,  #Turkey

Olu Deniz, a beautiful inland bay that stretches behind the cape, is now closed to yachts. The reason this heavenly place is called Olu deniz (""Sea of the Dead"") is attributed to the following legend;

Once a father and son were caught in a storm here and were in danger of sinking. The son claimed that if they approached the rocks ashore they could take shelter in a cove. The father on the other hand asserted that their ship would be driven onto the rocks and break up and that there were no coves around here anyway. In his terror of running around on the rocks, the father knocked his son (who was at the helm) into the sea with an oar and took over the helm himself. Just as the ship was about to hit the rocks on the cape, she turned into this calm, smooth watered bay. 

This is the reason they say the bay is called the Sea of the Dead, whereas what with the pine clad sandy beach stretched out like a tongue, the name ""Paradise Bay"" would be more fitting.

The Blue Lagoon of Olu deniz has calm, crytal clear waters which makes it ideal for a variety of water sports and a very safe place for children to swim. Part of the lagoon is now a protected area (and it`s a national park).
