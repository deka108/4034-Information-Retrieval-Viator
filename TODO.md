## Question 1: CRAWLING
- [ ] How you crawled the corpus and stored them:
  - [ ] Crawl the corpus (source, keywords, API, library): 
  - [ ] What the record corresponds to (meta information like publication date, author name, record ID)
- [ ] Information users might like to retrieve from your crawled corpus:
  - [ ] Example queries
- [ ] Statistics:
  - [ ] The numbers of records, words, and types in the corpus


## Question 2: INDEXING AND QUERYING
- [ ] Build a simple Web interface for the search engine
- [ ] A simple UI for crawling and incremental indexing of new data would be a bonus (but not compulsory)
- [ ] Write five queries, get their results, and measure the speed of the querying


## Question 3: ENHANCING INDEXING AND RANKING
- [ ] Explain how the enhancement can solve specific problems, illustrated with examples.
- [ ] Interactive search (refine search results based on spelling mistakes or similar search)
- [ ] Improve search results by integrating machine learning or data mining techniques (classification or cluster techniques)
- [ ] Go beyond text-based search (implement image retrieval or multimedia retrieval)
- [ ] Exploit geo-spatial data (i.e., map information) to refine query results/improve presentation/visualization

## Question 4: TASKS
- [ ] Motivate the choice of classification approach in relation with the state of the art
- [ ] Data preprocessing
- [ ] Build an evaluation dataset by manually labeling 10% of the collected data with an inter-annotator agreement of at least 80%.
- [ ] Provide evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure and discuss results
- [ ] Discuss performance metrics, e.g., records classified per second, and scalability of the system
- [ ] A simple UI for visualizing classified data would be a bonus (but not compulsory)

## Question 5: ENHANCING CLASSIFICATION
- [ ] Provide some innovation for classification and explain why they are important with examples
- [ ] Ensemble classification
- [ ] Cognitive classification
- [ ] Multi-faceted classification
